    As a caregiver entrusted with the well-being of a loved one, the importance of reliable and comfortable protective gear cannot be overstated. In my caregiving journey for my mom, I've discovered that MedPride Gloves are an indispensable ally, combining thoughtful design with utmost comfort for a seamless caregiving experience.Sensitivity and Dexterity:MedPride understands the unique needs of caregivers, and their gloves prioritize tactile sensitivity without compromising on protection. The gloves' thin yet durable material allows for a gentle touch, enabling me to provide assistance with precision and care. Whether helping with daily tasks or administering medication, the gloves offer a delicate touch that fosters a sense of comfort for both the caregiver and the recipient.Comfortable Fit:Caregiving often involves extended periods of wear, and the last thing one needs is discomfort or irritation. MedPride Medical Gloves feature a snug fit that feels like a second skin, minimizing hand fatigue and allowing caregivers to focus entirely on providing care. It is gentle on sensitive skin, making them ideal for individuals requiring extra care, like elderly parents. I have also never had it rip or had to worry about creating holes and wasting the product. They are very durable.Protection and Hygiene:Caring for a loved one often involves intimate tasks that require a reliable barrier against potential contaminants. MedPride Gloves, made from high-quality materials, provide a protective shield while maintaining a gentle touch. This is particularly crucial in caregiving scenarios where maintaining hygiene is of utmost importance.Affordability:MedPride Medical Gloves strike an excellent balance between quality and affordability. Caregiving often involves various expenses, and these gloves provide a cost-effective solution without compromising on performance. This is the only brand we buy from for caregiving for my mom. This is coming from a more expensive state such as Hawaii.

    We like them and use them for dealing with animal stuff like picking up dog poop and handling dirty things. Would recommend sizing up though, I have pretty small hands and we buy the XL size so 2 people with different sized hands can comfortably use them. They are a bit baggy on my smaller hands but they work well and get the job done. Pretty good quality, they rarely break while using them. Currently at a decent price, especially compared to a few years ago when they went up so high in price.

    Powder-Free Nitrile Exam Gloves, Large, Large (Pack of 100) is perfect for cleaning bathrooms.  I must say they are a little thin and break often- but the price to value is good.  I wanted the powder-free because you really don't know what is in the powder.  For my needs these Nitrile gloves work perfect and fit my hand perfect.  They do not fit a mans had as a LARGE so might want to find something bigger.

    I have purchased several boxes of these so far to use for a medical procedure I have to do for myself on a daily basis.  They work well for the intended use.  These are not very puncture resistant, so keep that in mind if you are purchasing these intending to use with sharp edges or items.  Out of about 300 or so that I have used so far, i had only 2 or 3 that tore while putting them on - and that could have been due to a sharp fingernail edge or something like that.  I have noticed that the thickness can sometimes be inconsistent (a lighter spot where they are more translucent - I do not have the means to actually measure thickness at this scale).  Of the ones that I had tear, none tore at one of these spots.Touch sensitivity is pretty good, I can feel what I need to almost as though I am not wearing gloves.  I also notice purely by chance that I can still operate the touch screen on my Samsung Galaxy S20FE mobile, although the fingerprint detection does not work (which is no surprise).  That touch works at all with these is a welcome surprise.These fit my hands well, without being too tight - I have had large size Nitrile gloves that feel more like small or medium.  Like all powder-free Nitrile gloves, these do not easily go on wet or damp hands.  I have yet to find a Nitrile glove that does.  I keep a container of 'baby powder' on hand for times I need to put them on damp hands - a small sprinkle inside the glove, shake to coat the inside, hands go in just fine.If I had to find an issue with these, it is the issue that every package of these types of gloves has - they tend to stick together in the package.  I often pull out more than I wanted because of them sticking together.  That is such a minor issue, and not one unique to these specific gloves - it is honestly the only thing I can find that is even close to being an issue with these.Would I buy these again?  Been through almost 3 boxes so far, have another unopened waiting for me.  When I open that one, I will order another.  Maybe I should look into case pricing on these given a box doesn't quite last me a month (with no punctures or tears).If you need a reasonably thin Nitrile glove to protect your hands from fluids, these are a good fit.  I would certainly recommend them for that use.  I would also use these for light cooking use, and light cleaning.  I would not use these for heavy duty scrubbing, though.

    These gloves are very easy to put on and have a secure fit, don’t rip easily and make me feel confident that I’m protecting my hands from contacting germs.

    These gloves are highly recommended, especially for individuals with larger hands. Their comfortable fit and ample sizing make them a practical choice for those seeking gloves that accommodate larger hand sizes. If you have big hands, these gloves offer a comfortable and well-fitting solution for various tasks.

    When I clean the oven, I use heavy-duty rubber gloves. Nitrile gloves are ok for a spot cleaning in the oven, but not the entire oven. They are great for other types of cleaning, such as the bathroom. And they excel for cooking. If I am making anything with beef or pork, I put these on. You can wash right over the gloves. So let's say I have bought meat at the grocery store and repackage it into meal-sized portions for the freezer. I have chicken, beef, and pork. Just slip these on and when I an done repackaging chicken, I wash my hands with the gloves on and use dish soap. Then I move onto beef, and do the same thing: wash my hands with gloves on and move to pork. When I am done repackaging, I remove the gloves using universal precautions and then toss them into the garbage. Then I wash my hands without the gloves. It makes me feel very safe. When I am cooking messy things, I wear them. You have full range of motion with your fingers, so they are great for mixing meats for meatballs and meatloaf, tuna for fishcakes, or breading pork and chicken. I highly recommend thee gloves for any messy task that does not require heavy duty gloves. Before you order, check the size. Very few people will take small, so make sure the proper size is listed in the description before you check out. Most women will take medium and men will probably take large.

    Disposable gloves are the best thing since sliced bread! I use them for everything! I'm one of those who can stand my hands to be dirty or all gummed up., That's why I can't make biscuits....can't stand that gooey dough on my hands. That's when these gloves come in handy! I use them in the kitchen more than anywhere else. Perfect for mixing meat loaf, breading meats or veggies with flour, handling raw meats, etc. Used them once to transplant a potted plant when  I was in a hurry. Convenient for cleaning house, bathrooms, potties, etc. Great for making Crafts and handling glue.The list is long  These gloves stay on very good and make your chores a little bit easier. I always try to keep an extra box! I have a granddaughter, that she too can't stand for her hands to get dirty. I suspect she will be a ""disposable glove girl"" too!

    We've bought these a couple of times now to use for at-home food handling and cleaning. They're very durable and we haven't had any break or snap on us, even stretched over cut gloves. They're a little short around the wrist so when dumping into a cleaning bucket you may get water inside, but that doesn't bother us and we've probably got big hands anyway. Great value, feels like a more expensive product but in larger quantity for the same price, we'll keep buying these in the future.

    I am allergic to unfiltered tap water so I use nitrile gloves while working with food and cleaning.  These gloves are not 'mil' rated on the box but I bought them in hopes that they would be at least the equivalent of what I've picked up randomly from local stores.  Unfortunately, they are on the thinner side and not what I prefer for protecting my hands from the tap water.  I doubt I will use them for working with food and cleaning because of that, but I can use them while painting since I wouldn't need to wash them first.  It's a good value if you aren't worried about the thickness of the gloves.  I got Size Small and they are sized accurately!  It is a relief to be able to find the Small because in stores, usually only 'one size fits most' or 'medium' is all that is offered, and those are floppy on my hands, lol.  Small IS Small in this brand!  I can't rate the durability because I have only tried them on to test the size and thickness.  But if you're looking for at least 4 mil, these are not it.  If you don't mind a lower mil, these would probably be fine :)

    I have used these gloves for years and years.  I first began to use them when I had to give medicine to my cat, in her ears.  I had need of alot of medical gloves lately and went back to these.  I  like their durability, their comfort and thick/thinness.  However, the last few boxes seem to really stick together.  They always have because the box is small but these ones lately feel like they were put in the box wet.  Sometimes I need to use several pairs and now I have to pull them apart and make sure I can put them on before I start to work.  I cant just pull them out of the box like I used to.  However, they are still very worthwhile since everything else about them is great.  Plus I like the color!!

    I did housework and these gloves did not rip. I also worked in healthcare for 33 years and can attest that these particular gloves are quality for other uses. Will purchase again because I want gloves that protect and not rip.

    I mainly use these nitrile gloves for food prep in the kitchen - handling meat etc. I've also used them for cleaning the bathroom and as an extra layer of defence when cleaning up after my dog in the yard.I have never had one break or rip on me so they seem sturdy enough. That being said, I imagine that anything rough or jagged could tear a hole so it depends what you're doing with them. The nitrile material does a good job of resisting moisture and maintains grip.They are good value for money considering how many you get in a box. The most annoying thing is there is no size chart or guide so I recommend having a look at the pictures for an indication of what a large looks like.

    I use these to protect my hands when working on cars. They don't last that long but they take a beating. I also like them thin so I can feel what I'm touching. So, I'm saying I don't expect them to last too long. Just bought two more boxes. I'd recommend.

    We like the size and weight of these gloves. Heck, I even like that they are blue. But they are stuck together in the box which makes them a little inconvenient to use. All I can think is maybe they were stored in a warm place or something? They are strong though. None of them have ripped.
