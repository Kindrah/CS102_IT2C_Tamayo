    I like the colors SO MUCH, they're super retro, and the cream color is *chef's kiss* perfect, and it fits my retro aesthetic perfectly :) Keeps my water icy cold all day, I like that you can collapse the ""straw"" thing, which makes it feel more sanitary than the cups that have the straw sticking straight up at all times. Super easy to clean, it's heavy, but it helps me stay hydrated so yay. I also like the Stanley brand, they can take a beating and still hold up pretty well.

in my opinion the best yet stanley tumbler. ‚ú® it‚Äôs made of recycled fishing nets (my biggest conservation interest), i adore the leak proof flip straw, it keeps my ice for 2 entire days, the 30oz is perfect if you‚Äôre petite/have small hands/aren‚Äôt very strong, the handle makes it easy to carry around everywhere, it holds ice to the top and a normal sized water bottle perfectly, the color selection is immaculate especially on amazon (i bought a second one in the plum stripe color tonight), and it‚Äôs sweat proof. next i think i‚Äôll be purchasing a 64oz in the charcoal or lavender just to have on hand for long trips, beach days, camping, etc.i really can‚Äôt imagine a more perfect every day water bottle. the only con for me is they did that collab with starbucks in the beginning of this year and with the goings on in üáµüá∏ üçâ i really did not like that - if you know you know - but making this from the recycled fishing nets is really something im glad to support because saving our oceans and our planet is so important and i wish more big corporations would be willing to participate and do the same. the fishing industry and the nets they litter everywhere are the biggest cause of oceanic pollution, there‚Äôs millions of giant fishing vessels üö¢ net sweeping the entire ocean floor at every second of every day killing every animal caught inside including endangered & non target species such as dolphins, sea turtles, & thousands of others. this continuous hacking at our oceans has reduced our coral reef and fish populations along with algae production by 70% in the last 50 years (most of the worlds oxygen comes from algae). their nets are the number ONE source of plastic in our oceans making up 80% of the plastic found at sea (straws only make up 1% for reference). so thank you stanley for doing something helpful to our planet! üåé üåä

    Looks exactly like the picture, LEGIT BRAND!Keeps my water cold for hours, sometimes more than a day depending on how cold the water I put in or how much ice I put in. The first bottle I got it had a small scratch, so I sent it back and they sent a free replacement, and it was perfect.I believe the bottle was handled fine, the only reason it had a scratch is because it doesn't come in a box or some type of bag or packaging. It's just the bottle by itself in the Amazon bag, which isn't very protective- especially when hitting all those bumps on the road or shipping to the destination.

    I have owned many water cups but I‚Äôve shunned the Stanley‚Äôs because of the hype surrounding them. I ordered this one after a close friend recommended this one because of the hardy top/handle.I LOVE IT. The color is beautiful and bright. The top looks so cute with it.The handle and top are well-made quite sturdy. They are heavier than some of my other types of cups. It is easy to wash and comes apart to wash easily. The straw is a good quality and seems like it will stay nice if I take good care of it.The cup itself keeps my icy drink nice and cold all day. Because I ordered the 30 oz I have to refill it at lunch time.Overall I‚Äôm very happy with this cup. It‚Äôs easy to carry throughout the day and it keeps my drinks cold.

    Gave it four stars because it DOES leak. But I got it for my baby to carry for her warm water for her formula since she dislikes cold or room temperature. It keeps her water warm for about 9 hours. I like it minus the leaking but it‚Äôs not that big of a deal. If you don‚Äôt mind the leaking I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a pretty great size. Lasts me all day if we are out or visiting family.

    I was a little worried when I bought it since a bunch of comments said that it arrived damaged. But omg, IT ARRIVED PERFECTLY! (almost). It only has microscopic scratches that are so hard to see. The handle arrived a little dirty but I washed it and it came off. I LOVE the rose gold. It‚Äôs more like a pale rose! I thought that a little bit of the logo would come off since it happened to certain persons. Over all I give it five stars!  love this ‚ù§Ô∏è

    One of my all time favorite water bottles! I love the size- the wide mouth makes it easy to put ice in and I love that I'm not refilling it every hour thanks to the 30 oz size. The handle on the top and the straw are both great features. It fits in my cupholder perfectly, is easy to clean, and overall a great product!

    Never tried Stanley until now.  Seriously takes keeping HOT... hot, and keeping COLD... cold.  I bought the large tumbler with straw due to my liking the straw feature however, you can take the straw off and just do the sipping, as with coffee.  Slender bottom allows you to place your mug inside your vehicle cup holder.  Flat base of mug is slippage proof, yet if you knock it hard enough it shall tumble.  I LOVE the fact that it can be cleaned in the Dish Washer.  Many of these Thermos Tumblers tell you NO dishwasher, yet this one comes out sanitized and does not lose it's color. I am a person who will drink half of whatever I have in the Thermos, put it down and come back to it later... sometimes hours later, and I honestly I like having what I left in the Thermos... either warm, or very cold.  When I mean warm, I mean as if I just microwaved it for 30 seconds.  I also love the top handle.  I can put it on my belt, or bike, or cart if needed.  Now I am going to look for the ones less than 30 ounces.  Happy Amazon Day.

    I was curious and bought into the hype.  Firstly, it was time for me to get a brand new container anyway, and wasn't compelled to buy anything for a few years and relied on water bottles instead.  There was all this buzz about the Stanley Cup.  I disregarded it because the style I saw on TikTok or YouTube or news article was the large cup with the large handle and long straw.  I couldn't bring myself to buy that! It looked so embarrassing and pretentious the way people--mostly those that looked like females--were carrying this style.  Looked like a bunch of Karens from all ethnicities, in my opinion.  Then I found one with a top handle, in all black including the Stanley logo.  So, I bought it.  It's simple, clean lines, doesn't stand out as pretentious and goes with my every day minimalist aesthetic.  I am happy with the quality, size and design!  I am glad Stanley offered this size, design and color.

    I am a flight attendant and if you fly with your refillable containers you know that when you reach altitude and open up your bottle to drink in flight the pressure builds up and squirts you. Stanley is made where that NEVER happens. I love that I no longer spray water all over myself when I need a drink! It fits perfectly in my bag and keeps my liquids cold overnight. I love that it doubles as a weapon when exploring on my overnights! lol! It is strong and sturdy and I can carry It anywhere. The only ""bad"" thing about it is the lid sometimes gets really tight. Id rather struggle to get the lid off, than have it fall off. Love this water bottle!

    This is my first Stanley product that I‚Äôve had for roughly 10 minutes & I‚Äôm already in love.Before washing I inspected the cup & there are no dents, scratches, chipped paint, etc. Upon the first sip I noticed a huge difference between my Simple Modern & Hydroflask bottles (especially the SM). The Stanley requires minimal effort when drinking & I was shocked at how fast the water flowed through the straw.I was torn between citron, lavender, & grapefruit. I never understood the hype & why people have collections w/ dozens of Stanleys. But after seeing the quality firsthand, plus all the pretty colors they have, I now understand & I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll grab one or two more in the future.

    I was unaware that these Stanley water bottles were such a hot item until my 8 year old twin granddaughters pleaded with me to get them ones. I was going to get them a generic version at half the price when they let me know in no uncertain terms that it had to be a ""Stanley"" with the logo on the side. ""All the kids have one except us"" they said.  While I did not believe that, and I'm a sucker for my granddaughters, I went ahead and purchased two, one for each.These are impressive tumblers, nice looking and good quality.  But are they that much better than the much cheaper generic versions? For me, if they make my granddaughters smile, they're worth it.

    I really like this tumbler!  It keeps everything super cold; it's easy to carry and I love the design and color.Here is where I'm struggling.  I can barely get the lid opened and I also have trouble opening the straw (flip-up straw). The lid, no matter how loose I tighten it gets too tight to open - and the straw is just a beast to open.  Is it me, is there something I can do to make them both easier to open?  I'm so afraid I'm going to break the handle trying to get it opened.  Honestly, I usually have to get my husband to open it.  Anyone else have this problem?  Did I get one that is just difficult?  Should I request a replacement?

    So I decided to get the water bottle after having one of the cups and not being really supersatisfied with how it held Cold and That it could leak but this water bottle is ten out of ten. I absolutely love this color combo of tiger lily and plum. It is a little difficult to open and close the spout But so far this is exactly what I was looking for I should have gone with it initially instead of the cup!! It fits and couple holders too.Which is a huge thing for me. The handle is shockingly comfortable to carry which is convenient because I have arthritis and I can still open and close it well.

    I‚Äôm a picky person who refuses to drink water unless it‚Äôs in a metal water bottle. I had a 40 oz Stanley with the regular handle and lid, and while it was great, I always spilled it. When I received this one, I filled it and tipped it over on my carpet to see if it‚Äôd leak at all. Not a drip came out. It‚Äôs amazing because it can easily lay in your bed with your or if it falls, half your water isn‚Äôt coming out!It‚Äôs also adorable as hell!

    I bought this in the 20oz size for a trip.  I love the handle and love that the bottle itself isn‚Äôt too heavy.  I‚Äôve seen reviews complaining about the packaging and I think they took notice because mine came very well packaged.  It was wrapped in bubble wrap and placed in a box with additional air packs, so it was very well protected.  I appreciated the reviews warning about taking the label off carefully so as not to remove part of the ‚ÄúStanley‚Äù painted on.

    Whatever motivates you to drink more water (brand of tumbler/jug, color, size, logo and/or the comfort of the hardware on it that makes it easier to carry) do it! Best money spent yet! üíú my 40üíß! Oh and if you're indecisive as to sizing, there was a $10 difference in between the 30oz and the 40. I easily spend $10 bucks on unnecessary things. Its worth it!! Get it and you won't regret it! üí™üèº

    I bought this for my daughter for schooland she loves it because it fits in the side pocket of her backpack and keeps her water cold all day. It also hasn‚Äôt spit water out of the straw when opening it like others have. The only thing that could be improved- and this applies to all of the Stanley‚Äôs we have- is making the tops easier to unscrew. It can be a mission at times. Worth it though!

    I bought this as a gift for my husband because we travel a lot this was only purchased for car travel and running around.The bottle is super good quality! It's solid,feels secure, and he tells me the thing he loves most is that it's super easy to drink out of. Be calls it the drink flow lol (he's a bit weird).It also does a really nice job of keeping his water cold for quite a while so he can better work on his 8 cups per day. It's light and easy to carry around.It is more expensive than other options but it works great and was a great purchase.

    This is a great travel cup. It's not even like drinking from a straw because of the shape of the mouthpiece. The built in mouth piece is part of the cap so there are no leaks. The bottle is sturdy, but not too heavy. The water inside has no metallic taste like other metal containers. This is my favorite part, I can bring my reverse osmosis water on the go and it tastes perfect.  Plus, a bonus, the color is cute.

    My husband bought this for me as a gift and it‚Äôs been a great warmer bottle! My only complaint is the screw that holds the handle started to unscrew and at that point the threads became striped meaning I needed to order a new lid. I used the warranty to get a new lid but they only had three color options (grey, Forrest green, and navy). My water bottle doesn‚Äôt look as cute as it did but I still get a lot of compliments on it.

    I was very hesitant to jump on the Stanley trend but this one has the right color way and I like the design of a 30oz tumbler with a straw and sturdy metal handle. This solves a lot of the issues I had with my old school hydroflask bottle. I was a hater before but I will admit when I‚Äôm wrong, good job Stanley!

    The unique design of this Stanley gets a lot of compliments. I bought this for work, I‚Äôm a Day Care Teacher so I use this daily. Both my coworkers and the kids like the design and color. It‚Äôs solid, it gets knocked over a lot yet not a scratch and keeps my water cold for hours.

    I got the 64oz size. I like this because I only have to fill it up once a day and I like that it is dishwasher safe. So far, no leaks and it keeps my water cold. My water tastes fresh all day and therefore helps me drink how much I should in one day. I have heard that Stanley has lead in there products, that makes me uneasy. The water bottle is also pricey-over 50 bucks. I plan to keep using it daily because it is helping me meet my goals.

    My daughter and I enjoy having ice cups and rather than have a pretentious 40 ounce Tumblr. This is the perfect size to fit inside your cupholder and carry with you discreetly rather than looking like you are carrying a giant trashcan around in your hand.üòÇ also, you cannot go wrong with the colors offered by Stanley for this line! Everything is beautiful!

    I am not the person to jump on a trend. I run a short term rental at my home and a guest left a hydroflask some months ago. Unable to reach them to return it to them I decided I might as well put it to use since I actually needed a good water bottle. I loved how it kept the water but I did not love the weight or the fact that it didn‚Äôt fit in the cup holder of my car. One of my students suggested this one with the handle on top to me one day in class when it came up that I was in the market for a new water bottle and I have to say, she did me a solid. This meets all of my needs perfectly (and prettily).

    Bought one of these after I got my mom one for Christmas since my other water bottle was just too big to bring with me to school. Perfect size and I love the handle. Wish they had better green colors but the blue is pretty nice too :)

    First time Iceflow owner and I am obsessed. Totally recommend this product and I love the carry handle. I use this every single day with no leaks, and am planning on buying another color. So nice to take along to work and up my water intake.

    This was a really nice product and holds a lot of water for me. The straw is hard to open at first but you have to just break it in over time. It took 2 days to get here and was a very pleasant purchase!

    Love that the straw folds down. It really is a straw, you don‚Äôt have to tip the bottle to drink. It has a handle and doesn‚Äôt leak if it falls over. It also fits in my car drink holder. Really happy with it.

    We love this color variation and the durability! This cup is a great value and it keeps the ice and water cold for a good while. This water bottle looks exactly as pictured, and the color variation is so unique and fun.

    Perfect size, color and leak proof. I have other Stanley's and wanted a better option for active lifestyle. This is perfect. Only complaint is cost but that comes with the stanley name especially now adays since they are all the hype.

    I do have to say I like the Stanley insulated cup, I tend to call them sippy cups because this is what I gave my son when he was little, not the Stanley but similar cups. It does keep my drink cold and ice cubes in it overnight and into the next day. My husband did buy me the large 40 oz one but I thought it was quite bulky to carry around, I'm not quite sure why people do. So I bought the smaller one. The larger one was very difficult to use while I was driving. It does say it is leak proof but it is only leak proof if the drinking spell is down if the drinking spell is up liquid does pour out the center of it so this one is not totally leak proof. I do like the carrying handle, I like the fact that there is not a straw sticking out of it, I like that I can pull the drinking mechanism flip up and down. I do like the cup but I have to say I'm not quite sure what all of the hype is it is simply an insulated cup I do have other insulated cups that keep my ice and my cup overnight and most of the day. So I'm not sure why people are fighting over them. So I did give it a three star because it doesn't leak if you have the drinking mechanism up so if it tips over while you're driving you will spill your drink all over your car. Also I'm not quite sure what makes this so special than every other cup.
