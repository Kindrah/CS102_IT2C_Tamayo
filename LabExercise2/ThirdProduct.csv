    I recently purchased the Wireless Carplay Adapter • 3 in 1 for my Honda Odyssey 2024, and I must say, the setup was a breeze. It connected automatically without any hassle, making the installation process a joy.While there is a slight half-second delay in touch response, it's important to note that this is likely due to Bluetooth connectivity. However, it's something one can easily adapt to over time. Despite this minor inconvenience, the overall performance of the Carplay adapter is commendable.What truly sets this adapter apart is the ability to enjoy YouTube and Netflix directly on the car's radio screen. This feature alone makes it a worthwhile investment, enhancing the overall driving experience. The convenience and pleasure of having these entertainment options at your fingertips during journeys are truly remarkable.In conclusion, the Wireless Carplay Adapter • 3 in 1 is a good investment that brings a lot of value to your driving experience. The slight touch delay is a minor trade-off for the convenience and enjoyment it provides. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend it to others looking to enhance their in-car entertainment system.

    This is the second box I ordered after first seeing was my car able to use the device. And this is all I get with audio only. And I can’t even reach out for help. For yes I rather refund and go with a better brand with better reading instructions.

    ...so far, it works! I'm using it in my 2022 Subaru Outback. It was easy to hook up. First I plugged it directly into the port, but then I found I like using one of the included cables so I can park the dongle in the slim pocket on the passenger side of the dash.Performance-wise, there's a delay in connecting when I restart the car, but not terrible. Skipping to the next song is a delay of maybe a second. It's dropped the connection once in mid-session--I'll be watching to see if that happens again. And, although very minor to me, in the interest of thorough reporting I'll add that mine doesn't have a blue light like the photos.I've used it for only a day but already find it a completely necessary gadget. Great to be cord-free!

    Connection: 4/10Audio/Video Playback: 6/10There is an obvious delay in playback during both music and video streaming, which understandably can be expected. Additionally, it takes approximately 2-3 minutes to connect CarPlay to my phone, on top of  manually having to connect to my phone's hotspot through the settings before accessing Netflix/Youtube which will advise there is no internet connection. Another issue noticed is that even after the vehicle is turned off, if close by, the audio tries to connect through CarPlay, so I have to manually disconnect it, otherwise, it just reconnects a call back to it. However, apart from these issues, the playback and all other features work fine.

    This is overall a good product. It was easy to install and the directions were very easy to follow. I use it everyday in my new car. It is easier than plugging in a USB to connect to CarPlay. The only reason I have it a 4 star review is because sometimes it doesn’t want to connect to my phone but after a few minutes of driving it ends up connecting.

    This product is amazing! The installation was easy. The only issue was figuring out wifi connections. I connected the H Box to my phone's wifi hotspot and connected my phone to my car via Bluetooth. The picture plays clear and I do not get a lag in the audio.

    Man this box is amazing not hard at all to hook up I just had issues with my hot spot because it’s a pain in the butt. Now I was worried that once I cut my car off and back on I would have to resign into Netflix but I didn’t everything was still there! The only thing I wish it had is Hulu I watch most my shows on Hulu so if anyone knows how to add Hulu please tell me how lol. But this is the best thing ever and well worth the money!

    I had this device for a few weeks now and I’m disappointed. The adapter’s connection drops all the time. It doesn’t matter if I’m parked in my garage or driving around. The concept is really cool but this device is over priced for what you get. I would not advise others to buy.

    It comes with twenty apps that you can use. But if you have apps like Waze or some other GPS app that is not google, it won't let you open those apps.  It won't screenshare or anything to open them.

The wireless CarPlay works really good. Here’s a few tips:1. You must put phone in Bluetooth mode for it to work wireless2. You must share and connect to your phones hotspot to watch Netflix and YouTube3. You need to sign into your Netflix and YouTube accounts from the car screen.
