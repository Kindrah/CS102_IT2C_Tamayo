"1","YMC 38"" Blue Beginner Acoustic Guitar Starter Package Student Guitar with Gig Bag,Strap, 3 thickness 9 Picks,2 Pickguards,Pick Holder, Extra Strings, Electronic Tuner -Blue","Alicia Moulton","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2019","I love my guitar!  I bought this guitar a year ago after deciding on a whim that I wanted to learn guitar but not wanting to spend too much money. I was looking for a good starter guitar and this was exactly what I was hoping to find! While you can tell looking closely that this beautiful guitar is cheaply made (for example, the rosette and sound boards are both stickers rather than being built into the guitar. They don't fall or peel off so I don't mind that, but that's one specific difference in quality compared to more expensive guitars), it is good quality for the price, has good sound, and still looks like a serious guitar. (It is a bit smaller than the standard size.) As some others have mentioned, it falls out of tune very quickly, but that felt easy enough to me to resolve with the tuner (included), pitch pipe (included), or by tuning it to a guitar tuning video on YouTube. This also comes with an extra set of strings, 2 different-style sound boards (you choose which to install/put on), a pick holder that you can attach to the guitar (I love this!), a set of picks, a strap, and a case. The case is not padded at all, so be careful, but I've still been able to use it to transport my guitar and am really happy that this guitar came with it because I wouldn't have wanted to spend money on a separate guitar case at this point. The case opens at the bottom and has an adjustable strap and pocket. I haven't used the separate guitar strap because there wasn't something to attach it to the guitar on both sides, but I could have figured this out if I had tried harder. I think there might have been instructions in the other reviews.Oh also, another perk of this guitar is the strings and fingerboard are very comfortable--at least for me. I tried playing a friend's guitar after playing this one, and the strings were spaced a little bit higher above the finger board than this one, meaning it required me to press on the chords harder to play. Playing this guitar was much more comfortable to me by comparison.If you are an intermediate guitar player or more serious than I was about your long-term commitment to guitar, you might want to get a more expensive guitar set.But for someone like me who wants something beautiful and functional but cheap, I leave this with a very definite 5-star review! I am thoroughly satisfied with this guitar set! I love that it is a complete set with everything I needed to get started and an excellent value for the price. I may upgrade someday, or I may be happy with this for my whole life as an amateur guitar player. I highly recommend this guitar."

IT SEEEMS A BIT SMALL , BUT NOT KID SIZE...WHICH IS NICE ACTUALLY. but buy the very best stings you can find, and get a few types, its a smaller frame and definatly benifits from very light or nylons. sliks are a good choise because they bring some tin trebble into the bass and mution that this body produces, and it wont make the screech sound as you move up and down wich make a begginner sound better faster, most learners slide to tthe next chord and pros usually lift more than beginners, using the coiled string rasppy screech to the benifit to the song or style and controls the ammount precisely, but to a begginner i feel the sliding sound on rough strings make them feel less confident,....i just saying drop all the junky gadgets(OTHER THAN THE DIGITAL TUNER) , the tuner is great! it even has optional intrumnents and drop chord tunes and stuff which ANYNE WOULD LOVE...ITS A GREAT GUITAR WITH CRAPPY STRINGS, Needs a better case too but it works great for a first or beater guitar, its just not easy to load the guitar from the bottom of the condom like case, but its ok, if the company would just send top end strings and a didital tuner that already comes with it and made the case zip all the way to the top at least istaead of the bottom only, this would be worth 3 times more....sothinking about buying it? heres my advise.... BUY IT, then order yourself some diffeing types of HIGH quality strings iin the very light side of string and get some full or partial nylons...and for times sake a guitar key peg spinner tool....iys just a lillte l shaped thing that makes it very fast to turn the keys to wind up the slack of a new string set....(MAKE SURE YOU LEARN ON YOUTUBE ATLEASTBEFORE RE STRINGING)it sounded ok with the second set of strings and amazing now i bought a fifteen dollar pack od ultra light earnie ball classical partial ny set.... this guitar is small enough for about a 7 8 yr old but large enough for me to just pick at all day and drag around in the truck and feel comfortable just taking a hour to sit on my tail gate and watch sunset in the smokey mountains  and pick some blues, and for 50 buck i dont worry about little scratches and stuff like i do on my 2000 dollart fender.but double the money too 100 , juts get a low end fender"

"12","YMC 38"" Blue Beginner Acoustic Guitar Starter Package Student Guitar with Gig Bag,Strap, 3 thickness 9 Picks,2 Pickguards,Pick Holder, Extra Strings, Electronic Tuner -Blue","JAR","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2023","Let's level-set: you're buying a guitar that costs less than a proper guitar case. That said, don't let that fool you, this is a great first guitar.There are two cons I've found so far: 1) The action is too high. ""Action"" refers to the distance between the strings and the fretboard. 2) The neck is bowed in the middle - probably the reason why they make the action so high to accommodate this type of issue.In my opinion, this guitar comes with the wrong strings. Metal strings require significant tension which makes the action issue, worse. For days I tried to tune this guitar and it would not. If a string was in tune when open, it would be sharp when pressed on a fret. Again, this is caused by the high action and the neck bow.You want nylon strings on this guitar and I'd recommend the D'Addario Pro-Arte classical strings that can be found here at Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000OR88ZI or at Sweetwater music store.Note that nylon strings in particular take a while to settle so you will need to retune them often in the first days of use. Be patient with this. I strung my guitar with the D'Addarios and it sounds really good, especially for a guitar at this price level.The terminations are not bad and it looks and feels like a pricier instrument. I'd recommend you remove the strings and carefully wipe the fretboard with a slightly damped cloth to remove some of dried up paint and other bits of stuff left from the manufacturing process.The neck on this guitar is narrow which is great for beginners and those with smaller hands as you won't have to stretch your hand as much.Once you're done replacing the strings and tuning it, Google ""3-chord songs"" and follow the link for a list of 100 popular songs that are easy to play. Enjoy!"

This guitar is a great buy for the price. It sounds good, stays in tune, and would be a good purchase for someone who is looking for an inexpensive guitar to learn on, or an extra guitar for travel. Yes the accessories are cheap, the strings included are not great and the included gig bag is kind of flimsy. But, those things are expected when you buy a setup for this price."

It is only by accident that I make a guitar sound like real music. So, it made no sense to spend big money on a top quality instrument. But this little YMC guitar has an impressively full sound, as good, if you can trust my judgement, as a more expensive instrument. The ""action"" is good, and I can plunk away for an hour with little disconfort to my pinkies, though my Sweetie sometimes suggests I take myself down to the basement to entertain the mice. I'm not a kid, but this guitar is the perfect size for a young beginner."

However this guitar package is only $40. That's a pretty good deal for someone just wanting to learn how to play guitar. This might be good for that person who's not sure if they really want to do it or not. The guitar itself came scratched up. But it worked okay. I agree with people who posted their reviews before mine that this guitar is ment for nylon strings and not for steel strings. I kept the steel strings on mine knowing that the bridge could possibly pop off at some point. I just needed a guitar to bang around and to take camping from time to time and not worry about it being destroyed. For the most part it sounds okay. I am worried about the bridge being pulled off eventually due to the tension of the strings. The tuning machine heads are ment for nylon strings. I do like the style of the floral pick guard. The intonation is off on this guitar, it is a bit hard to tune. The tuning flute that came with it is way off. It is complete garbage just throw that away. The electric tuner worked okay. The high e string broke off the second I tried to tune it. I put an electric guitar high e string on it and it seems to work okay for now. Overall this is an okay guitar for a beginner who's not sure if they want to continue playing guitar or it's a good guitar to take camping and bang around. It's just okay. The neck is a bit warped and there is no truss rod. This guitar also smells like glue! If you don't like the smell of super glue don't buy this guitar. The quality of this guitar is definitely mediocre however it's only $40 and it comes with the case in a bunch of pics and some different tuners and also a replacement pack of strings. I guess being this cheap you get what you pay for. It'll work for me for a year or two but then it'll probably break and I'll get rid of it and buy something better."

I'm into my 2nd year of playing and wanted a travel guitar to take around with me and not be concerned if it got dinged up a bit while traveling. This was way better than I expected and cheaper than those practice fretboards that you see around.It was well packaged and came with the following... - a dust cover - extra pack of strings (it was already strung but not tuned) - a pack of 9 guitar picks - a pick holder with adhesive backing to stick it onto your guitar (or strap I guess) - a pitch pipe - an electric tuner that attaches to your guitar - a guitar strap - an adhesive backed plastic plate  for the front body where you would normally get scratches from strumming (I don't know what it's called) - knobs for the strap already installed on the body and base of the neckI was able to tune it out of the box (although I'll give it a few days to acclimate to the temperature and humidity of our place) and it holds it quiet well.  I purchased the coffee finish which actually is lighter than the photograph (it's more of a cognac color) but is still nice to me.All in all this was an excellent purchase for me. I actually wonder if they just had a warehouse full that they needed to get rid of and threw everything but the kitchen sink in just to clear it out! (I don't think so though because nothing was dusty!)For what I got with it, the instrument quality and the price point I give this one 5 stars."

As with any guitar, you have to tune it to sound right before you play. A string broke in the process but it came with replacements. For the price,  this is a great “starter quality” guitar for kids, even adults who want a smaller sized guitar to learn on. The strap that comes with it is fine. The black carrying case is snug and not very protective. Plan to get a more durable case if you’re going to bring it places, or a wall mount or floor stand if you’re going to leave it around the house. Guitar itself is appropriate quality for the moderate-to-low price. (accessories are cheaper quality, but I didn’t buy for the accessories.)"

But, I learned from a friend at work that acoustic is/can be better for beginners. I don't make much money so I bought this one, cheap and quick to learn more. It works like any guitar would. I have found that when it was brand new, every day I picked it up to play it, the string were out of tune after I just tuned them the night before. It seems that they just aren't tight and need to be tightened a lot, they are new strings. After retuning it for 2 weeks everyday, it doesn't seem to come untuned again.

I've been using it for almost a week, and I'm concerned it's going to break, and eleven though was cheap (money wise) it still money invested and I dont want it to break.Sound (with the strings that comes with it) it's ok I do advice getting new ones.It does have a paint smell, specially the cover, but after a day or two it comes off.

Although a beginner, I have noticed that it doesn't stay in tune for long at all.  When I do tune it and go back though the strings right afterwards before doing any playing, some of the strings are no longer in tune - which was why I only rated 4 stars.  ???  May check into getting a different tuner or using an app, but getting the hang of the whole learning process is more of what I'm interested in at the moment.  All in all, pretty good deal, in my opinion!"

Yes, you do definitely have to tune* the guitar before playing and it doesn’t always stay perfectly tuned but that’s okay, once it’s tuned it doesn’t sound that bad. I bought this guitar because I have always wanted to play and I think it’s perfect for beginners. I’m anxious to see how it will hold up in a few months and will update my review if I have any problems!*If you have never tuned a guitar I recommend either reading up and learning how to do it first using the provided digital tuner or get someone who plays guitar to do it for you. I broke one of my strings the first time I tried using an app I found but eventually figured it out."

Nice color and size. Only problem and probably rare in nature, 1 chord was damaged and the box was almost open with only 1 piece of tape holding closed ( Easy to steal out of the box).

Fits my acoustic guitar reasonably well. Padding and feet are well crafted and functional.However, this doesn't fit my Strat or P-bass at all. the slight asymmetry of the bodies won't line up well with the cradle arms. If you align the body in the arms, they lean to the side. You can adjust the width of the arms but the top pad is anchored to one of the arms, so that becomes oddly aligned with the legs at anything other than as wide as it goes. The cradle arms are welded to the frame which (I think) is the design flaw. If they were free to rotate, they could be adjusted to hold the instrument upright with one arm wider/narrower than the other to accommodate slightly asymmetric bodies. Note... I have a Strat and Fender P-bass. These aren't exactly Gibson Explorer profiles.Does fit my acoustic, so I'll use it for that ."

If you're looking to buy a child a beginner's guitar and don't want to spend a whole lot of money, then I would suggest this one. She plays the piano and wanted to graduate to the guitar. She loves the blue. It comes with lots of accessories. The two downsides I found were there are some cheap looking black stickers that come with it that is supposed to be for decorating it. I think they look cheesy. We are going to have an artist airbrush her name on the guitar. Also, I wish there was a sufficient bag for the accessories. I can't count how many times, I've had to pick a ""pick"" off the floor. Over all, we are happy with this product."

I do notice that when I am playing and I am strumming a bit too hard the strings make a humming sound (yes they're in tune I always check before beginning to play and make sure my fingers have correct placement as well) but if I strum just a bit softer the buzzing goes away. That's really the only negative thing I have to say about it. Other than that it's a pretty good guitar to learn with, for the price it is."

And hold up, not only did I get the guitar, I got a CASE!? and pics and all this other stuff I didnt even know I needed.. less than 60 bucks.. if you have extensive knowledge and skill, this is NOT FOR YOU! This is for the Humble beginner.. the passionate artist with a newfound desire.. for the price, I thought I was buying barbie accessories.. I wouldn't pay a penny less for something that holds so much value, in the right hands.. I put 4 stars for craftsmanship because no it ain't PERFECT for someone who is used to HIGH quality, MUCH more expensive instruments. Also the dark coffee color I thought I was recieving was a lot lighter than advertised, but with the effortless shopping method and shockingly prompt delivery, I couldn't be more impressed."

"51","Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled — wired or wire-free (Black)","William Morgan","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2024","ALL of the Blink stuff I have ordered is getting this same review.  After doing an insane amount of research for a home security camera system I settled on Blink for ease of set up and cost.  In both of those areas there really isn't a close second.  As far as reliability, I'll check in again in a year or two--but other reviews indicate reliability is good.  So, good news: easy set-up, great prices, video quality is as good as any, motion sensors and other software adjustable stuff is easy to understand and do.Bad news:  The system is crazy slow.  I knew that going in, so it might be a bigger deal to you.  I'm willing to live with it mostly--down the road I plan to put in a much faster, wired, real time system with only one or two cameras, and Blink has a new ""Sync Module"" that is supposed to have greater range--and maybe speed things up a bit.  The slow is annoying...but not a deal breaker.It has notified me of low batteries a few times--so now I just let it go and they seem to recover on their own.  I've also had one or two go offline and I had to reinstall them.  I think there are two factors causing this, and again for the price I am willing to live with it.  For one thing I have the wireless range maxed out even with an extender for my WiFi network.  The other factor is it is currently the dead of Winter and cold beyond all reason.  9 degrees last night, high is 31 today.  Lots of snow and wind, too.  I'm harder to get along with in this weather myself, so I'll put up with some additional problems with electronics that live outside.Bottom line?  After three months I'm happy with it and I recommend any and all of the parts of the system I've bought.  It works as advertised and it's way cheap--including the annual subscription if you want cloud storage.  I will be buying a couple more pieces soon.  It is fully functional as long as you don't need a lot of speed.  I'm talking about minutes when I’m antsy and want seconds."

He immediately sent me a new doorbell which is now working great with my other 5 blink cameras. Can’t ask for more than that.Stopped working after couple months. Now Will not add to app. Have tried every fix there is on internet for many hours. On a whim I deleted and reinstalled another blink camera. Installed just fine, so I know my home system is working. Tried to return to amazon but apparently only have one month. Warranty says a year. Have 5 other blink cameras around house. So disappointed. Thought Amazon would stand behind their product."

The ongoing fees if you want to keep it are above average. You can DIY it by using a synch module - which you really have to have anyway, a usb power block, a usb cord and a usb drive. All of this clips into a cheesy holder and the whole thing plugs into a socket. Elegant design it is not. It occupies about 6 inches high by 4 wide and 4 deep of wall space. A strong cockroach can knock it out of the socket. But, it does store your clips  at home and you can pull the drive and send it to whatever cloud you have via laptop or desktop. The video bell is easy to install with 2 screws. Setup is just shoot a pic of the QR, and give it a name. It will not make any notification inside! Buy ( are you getting the idea blink is a kluge ? ) one from many retailers or use Alexa ( guess what kids you must buy this too) , for which there is a skill and multiple chime sounds. [ or hardwire to your old school doorbell chime I may do this when it stops snowing. Wait, I live in FL, no snow, I am never going to do this]. The picture is fine although 1k rather than the latest  2k.  If you wait a bit you can see it on your phone, though I find Alexa faster. There was supposed to be a one button push for iphone and android notification so you do not have to unlock phone, start app and click on view. I have not found it yet. Batteries. Yes you need them and they are why I bought this ( already having a blink setup). My old doorbell non blink cams use 18650 which need charging every 3 months or so and die between 2-3 years & require the most expensive $20 a pair 18650s. And I was not about to install doorbell transformer, wire and chimes which allow running on 12-26 volts AC but this is an option. My other blinks have run since 2021 without the bother of recharge on AA lithiums as does this. The AAs cost $20 a pair. I am happy. The voice com for you and visitor is clear, nightime view ok, you will recognize your Mom. Motion detection works well. Hey Amazon, Alexa, Blink we all know you are the same corp. - make the synch module a neat desktop saucer shape thing with cord and plug or even cord and power block. That wall wart thing is nasty. Guess what ? You can even add micro usb storage. Guess what what? Put the $%*& thing inside next gen echo view). One star off because Prime delivery guy would not install it. ( actually guys thanks for walking up that 2 story ramp to house every time I buy something).Update: Customer service. Wanted to have doorbell image come up automatically on bell push. Found a couple of u tubes on how to implement but due to poor eysight and worse hearing could not implement. Tried cust support. Asked me to allow them access to setup to help arrange. Did so, then got new rep telling me  She, was taking over. Well 17 emails back and forth it  ( it had to have been an IT bot calling itself Jen, paid no attention to anything I said) blew me off saying it could not be done but what a great idea would let the IT guys know. Right. See google for proof it can be done. Zero for you Jen and blink cust svc. Update: blink vust service emailed again and asked for third time what I wanted. Repeated whole thing and refered them to 3 videos showing what they said could not be done, could be done. They responded by sending me links on how to set up alexa. As I have bern using alexa for 3 years this was of course useless, as apparently is blink support."

Walkup","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2024","I have never such an indebt review, but I spent a whole year going through doorbells. I will start from the beginning of my experience. I will list the 3 main doorbells I bought, Why I bought them, what I didn't like about them and why I returned them and the refund process.This is what I was looking for in a doorbell. Also, I learned through out the process what was more important for my needs. It needed to be Wireless for easy insulation. Good night vision. Good AI detection, a separate chime for indoor, remote monitoring, a long lasting battery, Elderly friendly & easy to use, and one of the most important needs were budget. I didn't want to spend a big amount on the doorbell, Then, spend money on a app, cloud subscription, separate chime, & Alexa. I was buying these for my grandparents. They do not understand having subscriptions for everything nowadays, but has to be easy to understand and use.EKEN wireless doorbell and Chime; Bought on February 13, 2023. The reasons I bought it were, said it was free and no subscription, indoor chime, and the price. After buying this one I really learned what was important and if things seem to good to be true they probably are, duh right. First off, the app is free to downloads but is not free after that. There is a monthly app fee and cloud storage free. Also, the app is a Chinese app. its complicating and not user friendly. I got notifications every time a car went by. it was annoying. I only could see the street. It didn't show any of my drive but the very end. Only worked with 2.4 Wi-Fi. You could only have one indoor chime connected and it was not loud enough. One of my most annoying facts about this doorbell was I had to charge it every week! I live in rural area and I couldn't imagine how soon I would have to charge living in the city.  I returned EKEN on September 19, 2023 because it quit working. It would no longer connect to the internet or the chime. it was frozen for weeks. In the end I'm glad it gave out because it was really more of a nightmare and not free like they say! I paid $46 for this doorbell.Blink Wired/Wireless Doorbell; Bought on July 31, 2023. I really had high hopes for this one. This one was the most misleading, very vague information, and the hardest to get a refund on. This is not a wireless Doorbell. For it to really work with out an Alexa, google home or some kind of in home system you have to wire it. There is no indoor Chime. You are not told about  Sync Module when buying. The app is free but cloud storage is not and you need locally storage with the Sync Module 2 and USB drive (each sold separately). I was not aware of this when I bought it. However, with out an Alexa I couldn't even get it set up and use it and get the local storage later. I thought we could use the app like every other doorbell but with out the Alexa you will get no notifications. It doesn't say when I returned it, but I remember them telling me after a non-pleasant- conversation to keep the product and we will refund you. If you are wondering... no, you can not take it home and hook it up to your Alexa. they disable it unfortunately , . I paid $60 for this.Eufy Security, Battery Video Doorbell C210 Kit, Wi-Fi Connectivity, 1080p, 120-Day Battery, No Subscription, AI Detection, Wireless Chime Included, 2-Way Audio, Remote Monitoring for Apartment Living; Bought on November 5, 2023. I waited till the doorbell died for the first time to write the review. after the first one it was really important to me for it to have a reasonable length in a battery! I charged it for the first time for a good amount of time. The first's charge is always the most important on any battery powered electronics. It died on 2/15/24. The battery lasted 100 days with moderately amount of use. I am very happy with it. It does not take long to charge back up either. I am not getting a notification every time a car goes by either. The AI in the doorbell works really well on telling me when someone is here or when there is activity. Great night vision. One of my Favorite is it came with a free angle piece! so I see my whole driveway and street. The house is a normal ranch house so the driveway is 'normally' placed  none of the other doorbells came with a angle piece and the insulation looks great. There is a piece it snaps in-to, so, no thief can run off with it and protects it from water. Moreover, ITs free! The app is free and the chime is also a storage device! The chime is loud and has more then one chime. I did have to buy a memory card for the storage. In the reviews I read it said It has to be SanDisk 128GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter - 120MB/s, C10, U1, Full HD, A1, Micro SD Card - SDSQUA4-128G-GN6MA. You can have a lower GB but nothing higher then 128GB. I have had no problems with it  its just a basic memory card but works great with doorbell. I have had no problems with doorbell or local storage and chime. The app is super elderly friendly and easy to use. the company brags about being budget friendly. Eufy says, ""No Subscription Required: Designed to protect your home as well as your wallet, Eufy security products are one-time purchases that combine security with convenience."" I have no complaints with this product. I had to spend more money with this one but because I don't have to pay for a subscription, app fee, and cloud storage (storage is after the moment of doorbell going off being able to see it) I paid $99.99 with a $20 coupon. The memory card was $13.88. With doorbell and everything included, memory card, and coupon & tax; I paid $100.91.I Know this a long review, but if I could save someone a year of wasting time on doorbells I hope I can help!"
"57","Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled — wired or wire-free (Black)","4 Lil Lambs","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2023","I was initially looking at another brand because they had a wireless video doorbell that came with its own chime.  My home was built in 1897 and I don't have existing doorbell wiring or chime in the house.  So wireless doorbell that came with a chime was the way I wanted to go.  Only problem, this other brand didn't offer all the options and/or configurations I was hoping for.Then I was introduced to Blink.  It had all the options I needed.  Granted it doesn't have its own chime, BUT....you can use the mini or Alexa as your indoor chime.  Perfect!  Had the corner mount so I could point the video doorbell camera towards the entrance to the porch.  Again, old home on a corner with a wrap around porch where the entrance to the porch was on the corner and the door was at the end of one side.  Does me no good to have the camera pointing straight ahead into the front yard.  You can mix and match all of the devices to get the optimum setup for your needs, and they all connect seamlessly.Then I started doing my research on Blink.  Reading the reviews from customers really made me question if I should buy.  Too difficult to install.  Too difficult to set up.  Can't connect to Alexa.  Battery life a fraction of what they claim.  Cameras always disconnecting.  I'm glad I ignored the reviews, chalking up the technology issues to people just not being tech savvy.  I was right.Installation was extremely simple.  Not a fan of the online instructions instead of a booklet, but I managed.Sync Module, video doorbell, 3 outdoor cameras and 1 mini indoor camera connected to the Blink system with no issues.Connecting to Alexa was equally as flawless.  Set up the Blink skill in Alexa and ""she"" immediately found all the Blink devices. Our Echo in the living room, Echo Dot in the bedroom and the indoor mini will all serve as chimes wherever we are in the house.  The Echo devices will also announce any motion detection.  We can arm and disarm the system by voice command with Alexa.  Disarm does require a voice pin code which you have to set up in the Alexa app.Setting up and managing the devices in the blink app is fairly intuitive and straight forward.  You can adjust the motion sensitivity, set up privacy and no detection zones.  After setting up the doorbell out of the box, we would get random motion detection notifications.  After checking the clips, it had to be either vehicles passing in the street facing the door, or a flag flapping in the wind at the end of the porch where the steps are.  I shut off motion detection in the street, lowered the sensitivity slightly, but  left the flag area on, and no more false detection's.  So it was definitely not the flag tripping it.  Camera still picks up people as they come to the top of the steps and alerts us.Video quality is pretty decent.  I'm please so far.  Haven't been able to test what the night video looks like, or the two way voice at the doorbell  yet.  Once I am able to and if there are any real issues, I will edit my review.As far as battery life, it's too early to tell.  All the documentation I have read indicates that with the sync module and turning off settings or features you don't really need will extend the battery life to the 2 years claimed.  Time will tell.If I had a complaint so far, it's the fact that the time it takes from notification until a live view of the camera finally comes up in the app, the person tripping the motion detection has dropped off the package and left.  That timing needs reduced greatly."

And that was a problem.We got them activated, then it took a little while before we could get them installed.  I think we missed our 2 week free trial entirely.  But, it takes a while to get things done while unpacking.The day we put them up, we lost internet for 3 days.  They don't work without internet.Finally, we had them up and running.They are S L O W  .... I watched the mailman ring the doorbell ... set down the packages ... and leave.  As the truck was driving away, my phone chimed ... about 20 seconds.My son has enjoyed them.  He can talk with me from the garage door or front door.  I can open the Blink app to watch the live video.  My husband even gets the doorbell while he is driving around town.Maybe we need to get the services that go with these ... I didn't think about extra monthly charges when I ordered them.... service is by Blink, a company of Amazon.My ""Show"" doesn't seem to be able to connect to the devices .. one of the big reasons that we chose Blink doorbells is so we could see them from our Show devices.Overall, not impressed.I've never gotten the motion detection to work.  Night vision has not been tested.But since they are fully installed, I'm not removing them to send them back.Update after nearly 3 months:Great:You can talk to people IF you open the app.  But having the app open all the time is hard on your phone batteries.Easy to installWe are still on the first batteries, and the front gets a lot of traffic.It is easy to pause them if you plan to work near the camera range to avoid constant notifications.  (ONCE you know where to find it on the app)If your app is working.  It can be fun to scare the kids working near the camera... ""I see you!""  Ahem.  It can be great tool to talk to the person at the door.  Especially if you don't want to open the door.The range of vision is HUGE.  The resolution is great.  You can usually get good details.The Ugly:The delay is so long, that people sometimes walk away before you know that they arrived.  They hear the bell.  You hear it 10 to 20 seconds later IF you have sound up on your phone.No matter how hard I've tried, it doesn't really interact with my Echo Show.  That connection seems to do nothing.  I expected it to act like an indoor doorbell, and then show me the  camera view.  I expect my dots to chime.  But nothing happens.Images only show on the app cloud storage.  You can buy a device to store data at home.  But I wish I could view the picture from the doorbell 2 minutes later when I get the notification!Which leads to ... you HAVE to get that subscription if you want this to function as a camera.NEED TO IMPROVE:They need a dedicated box you can mount inside the house that has a loud CHIME when the doorbell is pushed.  OR  get this feature to work with your dedicated Alexia devices.  Doorbell is pretty worthless if the only person who hears it is the person who pushed the doorbell.  .... Yeah, it chimes OUTSIDE!Need to be able to pull open the app and activate the camera to see outside on demand (like I do with the Blink mini cameras)."
"59","Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled — wired or wire-free (Black)","team W","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2024","I first bought this in October of 2021 and my impression was, ""it's good enough for the price."" I've had two years and quite a story to tell, so get comfy. The short version is that I'd definitely recommend it, especially if Ring is a little too rich for your blood, but there are some caveats to be aware of.The first complaint I had with it was the sync module that it came with for storing the video clips. Put simply, there's really no using this without the subscription plan. Blink had told me the doorbell will sync with the module without a plan, but I never got that to work properly. I'm not mad; if I wanted a standalone, cloud-free solution, I had a myriad of other options besides Blink. Just be aware you should get a plan for it. It's a service first, a product second, if you follow. Something else to be aware of before we move on is to keep that little tool they include with it for dismounting the doorbell from the bracket. You can still remove the doorbell without it using a small screwdriver, but it's a pain. Whatever helps you hold onto that little metal key, go for it.My second complaint was the ""motion zones"" feature where you set blind spots so it doesn't get set off by every passing car. Trouble is, this never worked. I just resigned myself to scrubbing the clips everyday of anything that wasn't someone coming to the door and/or ringing the doorbell (the clips automatically erase after a set period of time, so you could simply wait it out rather than taking my proactive approach). What did work in this menu was the privacy zone. It's like the motion zones, only it puts a gray box over a designated area that's ""baked in"" to the video. The way I had the doorbell positioned, it was possible to see the keypad to my door. I didn't like the idea of that info being on the cloud, so I grayed it out.My third complaint is the most important one: fogging. This thing fogged up at the slightest drizzle. It would clear up with the sunshine, so I didn't think much of it. About a year and a half goes by and not only did it fog up again, but it stayed fogged up. I took a look at it and found the fog was on the inside. It looked like a mineral build up. This left a big, fuzzy blind spot in the center of the video, which rendered it almost useless. Faces were clear so long as they stood close enough to the door, but this was hardly ideal. I couldn't find any teardowns or anything that would help me get inside the camera and treat the lens from the inside, so I simply dealt with it, keeping my eyes open for other options.In December of 2023, I got another doorbell on sale for about half off. My thought was I'd pop the old doorbell off its mount and put the new one in its place, relegating the foggy one to another door (better than nothing). Trouble is, in the two years since I bought that first doorbell, Blink made improvements to the design. For starters, the batteries are no longer exposed. They're behind a panel and in fact I couldn't see any exposed circuitry like on the old one. I guess enough people had complained about the fogging for them to do something about it, though it remains to be seen if this one will have the same fogging problem (it's only been installed for about a week as of this writing). Unfortunately, this redesign meant I couldn't use the old mount, which angled the doorbell about 30 degrees so its field of view would encompass the whole porch. My solution was to move the doorbell to the opposite side of the door since it was closer to the knob and you could still see the stairs and walkway leading up to the door.As for value, I'm happy to say it's reached a point where, as far as I care,  it's paid for itself. Even if I had paid full price for the second doorbell, it would be worth the peace of mind. I caught a porch pirate. The whole reason we got the doorbell in the first place 2 years ago was because our neighbors had the car broken into. All was quiet thereafter, until a few days ago when a package arrived from Amazon. I got a notification while I was on break at work, so I scrolled through the clips and there they were pinching my package in broad daylight.I won't share the screencaps, but I caught this person red-handed walking (awkwardly) up to my front stairs, leaning over, grabbing the package, and walking away. I got three whole clips of their vehicle as well, a very conspicuous looking red coupe with mismatched orange body panels. I downloaded the clips to my iPad, went to the Police station a few blocks away, gave them all the pertinent details, and showed them the clips. The officer asked me to email it to him, and informed me that they might know the suspect. Apparently, they'd gotten some reports of suspicious activity, but couldn't prove anything had been stolen. I'm still waiting to hear back from the officer, but hopefully justice has been served. If anything, I hope the thief found a good use for the parchment and foil pans."
"60","Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled — wired or wire-free (Black)",NA,"4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2022","I am a long-time user of Blink, meaning I am in the ""grandfathered"" set of customers with free, limited cloud storage for video.  Overall, I think if you are already a Blink customer, this is a good addition to your system.Install: I needed one of those ""wedges"" that turns the camera to face out and using that, the install was pretty simple.  I agree with the people that noted that the back plate it comes with (which you still use when installing the wedge) is a little cheap and janky.  But the wedge is more sturdy and the resulting install is probably a little bit more solid and better than if I had just mounted the flat plate to the wall.You do need a good sized piece of flat wood to screw everything into.  This is not going to mount well to raw siding, curved trim pieces around doors etc.  You'd have to attach a small board to the surface of anything like that and then mount it to that board.Power vs. batteries:  I have one of those wired doorbells that is old-school, with the metal strikers that hit little chimes, not a digital doorbell.  This apparently matters because you need more power and a slightly larger transformer to drive one of those doorbells.  In turn, that means the transformer has enough power to power the blink doorbell.  If you have a digital doorbell you may (or may not) need to rely on the battery for the cameras.  It all depends on how big the transformer for your existing, wired doorbell is.  During the setup it asks you what kind of doorbell you have, and has a fairly sophisticated set of settings to make sure that when it sends a signal to the physical doorbell it is sending the correct amount of power to strike the chimes correctly.Set-up: Very easy and painless, almost exactly the same as setting up a regular blink camera.  Put in the batteries, scan the QR code, it finds the camera, links it to your existing system/sync module and you are ready to go.Motion Sensor: If you are already pretty familiar with Blink cameras, you know they can come with one of two kinds of sensors to detect motion.  Camera based sensors that just detect changes in the picture and more traditional sensors that only detect actual, physical movement.  The cheaper Blink mini only has a camera based sensor, while the more expensive units only detect actual physical movement with a dedicated motion sensor.  Both kinds of sensors can be triggered falsely by something like blowing leaves, but the camera-based sensors cannot distinguish changes in shadows and light from actual movement and so they have much higher rates of false detection.  Unfortunately, the blink doorbell appears to only have the cheaper detector that can be fooled by changes in light.  It does, however, have a more sophisticated, narrower grid of zones you can exclude from movement than the older Blink mini.  How much this matters to you is going to depend on where you plan to stick the camera - if you point your doorbell camera directly at a busy road and don't lock out the parts of the image that covers the road, you will get constant alerts from every car that goes by, or every person walking on the sidewalk, etc.  So think carefully about where the camera will sit and whether you want one of those wedges to tilt the direction of the thing to keep the camera aimed only at places where you actually want it to detect motion.Video quality: Very good, with a wide angle, almost fish-eye lens, so you get very good broad coverage of the area you are pointing the camera at.  There is also a microphone that records sound while you are recording video and it seems to work ok as well.  In theory you can use the thing to have a two-way conversation with whoever is at the door, but I haven't tried that yet.  I am, overall, very happy with the camera quality for the price here.Sound Chime/notifications:  When you push the doorbell, a chime inside the module itself goes off.  It is reasonably loud and lets the person ringing the doorbell know they definitely rang it.  The light on the button also lights up briefly to confirm the chime was pressed.  Would you, sitting inside the house, hear the chime the doorbell makes outside?  Probably, if you are in a small, quiet house.  Would you hear it  down in the basement of a large house with the TV or music on?  Absolutely not.  So if you are not hooking this up to an existing doorbell with a properly loud internal chime, then you will want to have it hooked up to your Alexa.  I don't use Alexa so didn't test that feature.  You do get a notification on your phone, when somebody rings the bell,  but I think most people will want either a hard wired connection or an Alexa connected to this thing to make sure they always hear the doorbell.What don't I like?I wish it had the same motion detection sensors as the larger blink cameras.  I would have paid more to get that.  Because it uses the camera to sense motion there are places where it really won't give good results.  So think very carefully about where you will place this, how often the wind will blow trees and create moving shadows within the motion detection zone, etc.It is annoying that even when the device is hard-wired, the light around the doorbell button isn't constantly lit.  Just as if it were only running on batteries, it only lights up when you press the button.  Not a huge deal in my installation, but if you don't have a porch light on, your doorbell will not be obvious to visitors.  It is particularly odd that they put a red LED into the thing which apparently has no purpose other than in the initial setup.  The design would be much better if the lighted ring around the button was always lit and then it flashed or turned red when you pressed it.  It appears all of the hardware necessary to do that is in the device, but it is not programmed that way.  I get that when the device isn't hardwired you don't want the button lit, but when it is powered it really should be lit in the dark.For $50, this thing is ok.  If you get it on sale, then it is a good deal, at least if you are an existing Blink customer.I am surprised that they killed off the little bit of free cloud storage for new customers.  That can't cost very much to provide these days and it was the key differentiator between Blink and some of these other companies that provide more elaborate, high-priced options.  Blink's claim to fame is that it works well enough and is cheap.  But if you have to pay a bunch of money for cloud storage no matter what, I would probably look at the more expensive options vs. Blink.  It stops being a compelling value once you start having to pay for video storage."

If you are like me you are a happy existing Blink Camera user who is thinking about adding the door bell to your existing setup. I had a blink camera setup aiming at my front door so at first I was not too sure that I really needed the door bell.  However for the cost I am very glad I got one.  There are a couple of things to know:(1) If you are an existing Blink customer, you do not need a second sync module.  All you need is the door bell and you can simple add it to your existing account (as easy as adding an additional camera).(2) If you are planning on hardwiring the blink doorbell to your existing doorbells wires. . . . you still have to use 2 AA batteries to power the camera.  This did not make sense to me as I figured my hardwires would power it, but sure enough after calling Blink support I realized I needed to put the AA batteries in the camera.  The hard wire will allow your blink doorbell to ring the doorbell in your home but will not power the camera.(3) You can turn on motion detection or just have the blink door bell turn on when the door bell is rung.  This is a nice feature.  If you want to catch anyone that comes to your door (whether they ring the bell or not, you can simple turn this feature on in the app).  If you want to save battery life and are only interested in door bell ringers you can turn motion detection off.(4) It has two way audio, meaning you will always hear the person at your door. . . . but you can also choose to speak to the person if you choose.  For me the audio the person at the door hears comes across a little staticky, but that could be my phone or the fact that I am using the corner mount.(5) It has more of a fish bowl view so it catches a wide view (meaning it can cover most of your front porch)(6) There is no additional cost to having the Blink doorbell or camera system.  Unlike other door bell systems out there, there is no additional cost to the Blink Doorbell.  The app is free, cloud storage is free, downloading images or videos is free, etc.If you are looking to set it up with just batteries and no wiring to an existing doorbell system, setup is a breeze (will take two minutes).  If you are looking to hard wire it, it is still pretty easy.  I am not a handy man and what I know about electricity will shock you (get my joke) but even I was able to hard wire it.  Get the doorbell, you will be glad you did.  Hope this review helped."

I also discovered you can have Echo Show or Echo Dot be your chime so again if you understand Alexa routines,  and you have alexa devices,  you will never have an issue hearing when someone rings your blink Doorbell,  don't forget to link your Blink app and the Alexa app to ensure the above things work for you,  okay on to issue I can't find a work around,  Blinks idea of battery life reminds me of auto manufacturers MPG  estimates,  we all know in the real world it's not going to happen,  sure,  if you dial down all the features,  you might get half of what Blink says,  but then I ask you,  why have it,  we buy them to use them right  ?, so I have found average battery life even using the suggested energizer ultimate lithium,  is about 6 months,  not 2 years  and don't care how they or their paid reviewers try to spin it,  it's not going to happen even if you dial all the features down,  making it a waste of money,  and yes I'm using the sync module which is supposed to help battery life,  maybe it does,  can't answer that but real life,  no B.S. spinning,  your not going to come close to their battery projections,  my only work around for that is the batteries are easy to change and I understand and can deal with this,  Speaking of the Blink module,  I use it for local storage and I also use the pay for cloud storage,  that's another non work around issue,  far far to many features are LOCKED OUT,  if you don't pay for the Blink subscription,  Now if you don't care about saving videos and you just want to know who is at your door regardless if you are home or away,  this will alert you,  it will display to you video of who and allow you to talk to them also and I must say it does a good job at it and you don't need the blink subscription and if you do have the Blink module and a usb stick in, it will save those for you,  at short lengths,  but it will do it.  Overall it is a good security device,  and although obviously it is far from the better ones.  From a pure value Perspective I would highly recommend this,  , easy to install,  no wires,  pretty much can put it where you want it,  Again it does everything pretty well,  One of the best prices out there,  just understand it has shortcomings,  but also understand it's price,  and it will certainly do the job for you,  this isn't a trashing review,  I  tried my hardest to be real and actually recommend it,  it just doesn't function at the upper levels of some of the others,  but it doesn't have the upper price tag , plus I am actually going to buy another,  remember,  you can put them about anywhere,  I actually have one stashed at the front of my house,  not by the door,  it gives me a full frontal view of my home when I am away,  sure it is a Doorbell but it is a camera as well and at this nice price why not,  weather elements have not hurt mine a bit in the 13 months I have had them,  including the one not by the door and pretty open to rain,  snow and cold,  it has held up well,  still ticking,  no signs of wear,  so another plus"
"63","Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled — wired or wire-free (Black)","Gump","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2023","Originally we purchased a Ring doorbell which I loved initially until I realized it was stuck downloading firmware. Dealing with Ring support I cut my losses and got this doorbell from Blink. Quite literally 1/5th the price of the Ring.The Blink doorbell nearly fit in the same location which was nice. Now I only have a small hole where the Ring unit was. This doorbell only has 2 screw holes for securing it to the house, less than ideal but still, secure enough. It is able to be wired into a regular doorbell transformer so I have it on ac power. I'm not sure if it was meant to be able to ring an indoor ringer but I couldn't get it to work, but also suspect the old indoor doorbell isn't functional. It came with the house that was built in 86 so I wasn't hung up on that working.However... This doorbell doesn't come with a ringer, not really. It will ring OUTSIDE, the unit itself will chime, you will NEVER HEAR IT inside your house. I mean I supposed it's possible if you live in a tent. Blink has some indoor cams that will double as wireless door chimes, get a set, call it a day, you won't be disappointed.Supposedly you can get Alexa to squack when someone rings the door bell also, don't count on that working consistently, it's a nice thought, dare to dream right? We have 8 Alexa devices throughout the house and maybe 1 in 10 doorbell rings will also ring on the Alexa devices. The Blink indoor cams, chime every time so again, that's the best solution.The doorbell also comes with a wedge if I remember correctly, for turning the doorbell from being buried in a corner to face into your entry way a bit more, but if there is siding or something that faces your doorbell towards the sky or something like that you'll have to figure out a way to aim it more directly at visitors. I ultimately removed a swatch of siding to mount the doorbell flush against the house and that was the best solution and viewing angle.Overall, video picture isn't bad, motion detection is a bit sensitive, but still tweaking that. For the money you can forgive a lot of this doorbells short comings. None of them are deal breakers, but there are little things that you don't know about till you get your hands on one.I will say this, research your purchase, if you already have Ring, stick with Ring, in order for most of these smart cams and doorbells to save videos, you have to subscribe to Blink, or Ring or whatever for their cloud storage. Typically it's $4 per single device or $10 for unlimited devices, per month. Originally I thought I had read that Blink would allow 7200 seconds for video storage in their cloud without a subscription. Yes that is correct but ONLY if you have what they call a legacy or grandfathered account. So if this is your first Blink device, and you want clip storage in the cloud, you will have to get the basic sub for that. If you have other Blink devices and a hub with USB flash memory storage, you can live without the sub. The nice thing about the cloud storage is you can manipulate your saved clips much easier than if you just have the hub and USB storage. It's a toss up depending on how much convenience you want. Just know that if you can't live without the cloud storage option, you will be paying for a sub for each brand (and apps for each to control them), there isn't anything out there that can combine them all into one. I didn't want to have Blink, and Ring, and ...? subs because that's getting expensive just to save clips so I opted to go with all Blink devices."

I like it & it was very easy to install. It comes with brackets for flat mount or angled mount. Unfortunately, because of where the doorbell had to be installed, it’s exposed to weather. There have been no issues with leaking, but the rain gets on the lens & obstructs the view. Now I’ll have to buy one of those hooded brackets & hopefully that will solve the problem. I’ll update this after I do that. The only issue I’ve really had with the doorbell camera is that the night vision leaves much to be desired. My other blink cameras have really good night vision, so I figured this would be the same, or at least comparable. The first time I checked it at night I thought it wasn’t working because it was totally black. It was working, but just has horrible night vision no matter which settings I use. If you have lights, it works great & the picture quality is actually better than the Outdoor 4 cameras I have. But if you don’t have lights, all you’ll see is black, until something goes in front of it. I’ve reached out to Blink, so I’ll update this after coming to a resolution or conclusion with them."

Installation and setup via the Sync 2 module were fairly easy and straightforward. Getting the doorbell to connect with Alexa was more challenging, and I’m still not really satisfied with the interface with Alexa. It does work better than the outdoor cameras, but it’s still only good, not great or excellent. One tip - the camera does not have as wide a field of view as you might think. I mounted this where our previous, non-camera doorbell was. The camera can pick up my wife’s face, but my 6’0” frame puts everything above my shoulders out of camera field of view. You will have to test carefully before you mount to make sure you are seeing all you want/need to see. Also, the doorbell camera shares a flaw with all other Blink cameras. It is very slow. From the moment you respond to a notification of a doorbell push or motion to the moment the screen on the app will show you who is there is at least a full two seconds. That may not seem so long but try for yourself and see what could be happening outside your door in that length of time. So, the plus is, it works and it is easy to setup. But it does have some drawbacks."

It looks good and modern on the door, and I feel like people instantly see it and are more cautious as they know everything can be recorded. It helps security in that way, and was fairly easy to install. I got a solar panel mount to put it in to avoid having to change the battery, and it's affixed quite firmly and nicely. It works well, and has a loud chime. The only issue is the delay. It may be the Wifi, but my Internet speeds are pretty high and still the chime only rings by the time someone has pressed it, turned and walked down the stairs. I appreciate I can hear the chime on the doorbell, my phone and the little camera I got bundled with it, which I have in my living room for a louder signal. But the delay is pretty vast if that's something that would bother you.And to get motion detection alerts, you'll have to sign up for the subscription. During the free trial, it seemed to work quite well, but since I have multiple security cameras, it didn't seem necessary to have that when I just needed a doorbell. For that purpose, Blink seems reliable and stylish, if slow. So it will depend on your needs if this is a good fit."

It is wireless so we rely on the lithium battery to operate. I had to change the batteries in Feb. So they lasted 2 months, which is fine with me, as I check it frequently when my dogs are outside in the yard and they are barking, or when I hear sounds after dark. They're are people walking up and down my street all night. My motion sensor lights come on and my Blink camera will notify me. There was a time when I wasn't home and had deliveries made, and also the city needed access to my yard to check something (which I was already expecting) so being able to speak with the city worker to give permission to proceed was valuable, otherwise we would have had to wait until another time."

So for that effort in them wanting to help I give the company 5 stars. As for the product itself I give 3 stars because it picks up everything even a tree branch on a tree moving. I hate to see what will happen with my blink when a wind storm comes through. Last night it picked up a wolf coming through my yard. With Ring it only picked up people and packages which is what I want a video doorbell to do. I left Ring because of the price hike they did this year. They went from $30 to $49 a yr and I would have paid a small hike and counted it as inflation but that big of a hike and Im gone.I had made a negative feedback originally because I could not get my chime to work. Well I got a professional to come out and fix it and come to find out it was because I just mounted it to the wall and expected it to work but I did not know you also have to go through all the steps in the app to get the chime to work.

I believe I’ve have this for 2-3 months so I guess that pretty decent but!! The battery may not last that long if you are always peeping/talking through it at all or most times there is motion or if the setting are set to where it’ll drain the battery more. Anywho, the batteries were apparently low or dead. The doorbell wouldn’t record motion all the time and at a certain point it just stopped working. It was acting weird for about 2-3 days recording maybe 2/10 times there was motion but the app said it was online and the battery life was “ok”. It says “online” even though the camera was nkt operating at all. It wasn’t ringing when. I pressed the button nor was it detecting or recording anything. I thought something was wrong with it because the app didn’t reflect what the real issue was which was literally just dead or dying batteries apparently.You need the sync module 2($34.99 does not include storage you’ll have to buy a usb storage drive separately up to 256GB from what I believe to have read) if you want to be able to see live footage or speak live through the camera. You can do those things with the sync module 2 and the subscription.I don’t have a sync module 2 so I can only see recorded motion which it is triggered by motion or the doorbell being rang. No footage will be recorded w/o a sync module 2 and/or a subscription.You have to rang the doorbell after each time you click save in settings in order to put those new settings in place. So be prepared for that.Microphone makes a weird buzzing sound sometimes. I think after a few seconds of recording that’s when it kicks in. For the price of $29.99 w/ tax(I got it on sale it is showing it usually goes for $59.99), I can’t complain too much. This is one of the most affordable wireless doorbells out right now.I know it’s the norm now but a con to be is the subscription. Without a subscription you’re pretty limited on what you can do. You might as well not buy one unless you plan on getting that. $3 a month for 1 camera and $10 a month for 1 or more.Gotta have a sync module two for you to be able to hear the doorbell ring through the speakers on your other cameras if you have em.Does not always catch the motion. So far it’s been good with it but a good amount of times it didn’t record motion. One instant, my child was playing outside and ran passed it and the camera didn’t record him when he ran passed it again the opposite direction. He left his play area and the camera didn’t even record that. Luckily it’s in a pretty enclosed space but that camera made me think he was still playing in that area while the whole time he wasn’t. Of course check on your kiddos but don’t reply solely on this to detect motion in front of your door at all moments. They’re also gaps between recordings.Pros: comes with batteries, easy to set up, decent camera quality, very quick customer service(I can get ahold of someone in like 1-3 minutes). Decent camera quality even when night vision is activated. No issues with it going offline randomly like the blink mini cameras do. Small and easy to hide. Door ring has a notification that comes to your phone in the exact sound as the doorbell(phone can’t be on silent or of course you won’t hear it)."

Until now…The only reason for my 1 star review, is that the return / customer service from blink, is so useless and frustrating.My most recent order, was 2 new doorbell cams. 1 is fine. 1 does not work. It doesn’t show video. Can add it to the system, but can’t view video or create thumbnail. Easy to understand, correct?Today, 12/23/23, marks more than a whole week, of emails, phone calls, constant communication with absolutely NO results. I am currently on my 4th “representative” for absolutely no reason. I’m not Sure why. But they DO NOT want to replace my broken yet brand new camera.I’ve reset it 40+ times. I’ve re added it to the system just as many times. And what does every new “customer service rep” tell me when they come on board? They tell me some version of “have you reset it? What’s your email address? What’s wrong with it? You should probably reset it.”Point being. It’s been over a week. There is no option to return or replace via the Amazon app. Which is new. I’ve never seen that. And so YOU ARE FORCED to deal with all of these people who obviously do not care that they sold you a broken camera, or maybe they are told to just stall, until the customer gets so fed up they just set the camera on fire and post it on socials for the world to see. Not sure.As for me. This is my last attempt to get my new camera replaced with a working one. Amazon, you own blink, I think? Please help us all understand how this is ok. And lastly, help me understand why I can’t return or replace this item as I can every other purchase I’ve made on Amazon. And there have been a few. lol. Merry Christmas everyone!UPDATE. Blink finally sent me a replacement doorbell camera. And guess what? It fixed the issues! So. Although this is definitely a 5 star item, with the experience I had, and the absolute CONSTANT “turn it off and back on BS), I can only give it a stars."

Joyner","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2024","I received this last week and the set up was super easy/user friendly.  I think the entire process took about 15-20 minutes from unboxing to up and running but I did choose the wireless method.Just follow the instructions after downloading the app (step by step) and you'll be fine.I'm sure that wired will take slightly longer but probably just a few minutes since it's just splicing two wires.  I would have gone with this but I don't have an existing wiring to work with and don't feel like doing it in the middle of winter.  Maybe when summer comes around...?You DO NOT need to have Alexa in order to use this since it can run off of your existing wifi.After getting it mounted and operational, you'll want to play with the motion sensitivity because although it claims to have a range of 25 feet, mine was detecting motion at well past that at around 60 feet with the sensitivity set to 6.  I eventually worked it down to 2 and now it's perfect for my preferences.My primary reason for getting this was because I have had a mail carrier just carelessly  tossing packages on the stairs up to my porch so that they are visible to all passers by and obvious for package thieves.  I was finally able to contact the postmaster with proof that this was happening along with a video and photo of the carrier who kept doing this.I don't know how the batteries will hold up but I don't consider that a concern since I always keep rechargeable AA and AAA batteries on hand for the various battery operated gadgets around the house.Video quality isn't perfect but it's more than enough to identify who is there.Audio is sufficient to communicate even with background noise/traffic.I like it enough to buy a second one for the back door."

This is much better than the rechargeable battery types that need to be charged every month or so, and eventually will no longer hold a charge. The Blink application is excellent and live customer support is outstanding. I use this on the lowest resolution to save battery usage, and still get amazing results.  Why would you need a 2K doorbell camera?  FYI if your monitor isn't a 2K monitor then you cannot take advantage of the higher resolution anyway!  I have a 3-camera outdoor setup which was very easy to install.  Using the Sync module you never have to pay a ""ransom fee"" for storage and reduce your Wi-Fi router load when using multiple cameras connected to it.  Go Blink, you won't regret it (especially when they are on sale)!"

Also, the setup instructions are not very detailed, and it wasn't clear that I needed to go into the settings to tell it I was doing a wired installation.  So, initially, the inside doorbell wouldn't ring and I spent about 30 minutes troubleshooting.  Once I realized I needed to go into settings and tell it ""wired"", it worked.  Also, securing the doorbell to the backing mount was not as easy as the instructions made it seem...I had to figure out how to align it and then press hard.  I was afraid I'd break something.One last detail...I didn't realize there was an option for a corner or angled mount.

Overall it works fairly well, but the system stops recording motion every morning at sun up. In order to make it work, I have to open the app once it's daylight, disarm and re-arm before it will capture any motion at all - even if someone rings the doorbell, it will NOT record if I haven't done the daily reset. Sometime this daily reset requires me turning off all the individual motion detectors and then putting them back on, before it will start recording again. For a service that costs me $10 a month, I'm frustrated that I have to babysit it each day. Once it starts ""working"" again, it will work perfectly until the sun comes up the next day. So weird and so annoying.I've noticed other viewers complaints that mention the cam doesn't always detect human motion - I have discovered that detecting humans/dogs at a distance (my cams are about 20 ft/6m from the sidewalk) only happens when the exterior temp is above 50F/10C - it seems that the human body temp is not readable if they are wearing heavy coats or generating body heat, but on warmer days, there's never an issue detecting at a 20 foot/6 meter distance.The zone section works well - I was able to block out neighbor's Christmas lights, which were setting the cams off every minute.Set up with the App and installing on the porch and doorframe was very simple.My only real complaint is needing to reset the cameras every single morning - no exceptions unfortunately."

I am using the Blink App v. 27.0.Plus :• Price?  I got a doorbell, the Sync Module, and an Outdoor 4 camera for ~ $105.  I’d been looking for some additional security / surveillance options, and this caught me at the right time.  Alas!• Decent enough video, for a wireless, battery-powered device.  Nothing to write home about, but if someone is within 20’ you might be able to make him out.  That is still under review though. (One day so far.  I have the video resolution on “High”.  Battery life will be affected!)• Tolerable field-of-view.• Sound.Minus :  Everything else:• Blink’s web site and documentation are awful.  Vague, misleading.• No Win (or Mac) app.  Everything is tediously handled through a SmartPhone.  (I tried to install the Blink app in a Win11 WSA (Android VM), to no avail.  Amazon Appstore doesn’t have it.  I don't like SmartPhones!)• Confusing navigation settings in the app.  They need a Human Factors Engineer.  Trying to find out how to set things is tough.• Glitches when setting up parameters.  E.g., I tried setting up both cameras’ Activity Zones, but they don’t seem to work as expected.  I continue to get recordings for motions in the Inactive Zones.• The Recording feature does not correspond to what I desire.  That is, when a Movement causes the camera to record, I want to record it for 20 seconds, period : don’t stop.  It does not do this.  Sometimes it only records for two seconds, then stops, even if the person is still in view.• I wired the doorbell to use my current 24 VAC doorbell.  But I still need to have the two AA batteries installed. What’s the point of that?  OK, I can hear the doorbell inside the house.  Wonderful.  Some website info indicated otherwise, that the batteries were not needed.  Wrong.• I am expecting to have to replace the batteries in a month or so.  Updates later.  But how long do two AA batteries power these things?  (I saw a solar panel option for the camera….)• There is often a very long time lag when I want to see either what is happening NOW or when viewing old “Clips” (using the phone app).  We’re talking 20 seconds.  So what’s the problem?  My ISP, Phone, the app, devices…?• The need to use the offline storage (Blink Plans) is arguable.  They tend to force your hand by crippling the Thumb Drive storage function of the Sync Module.  Nefarious.Oh.  And what is Amazon doing with all this info?There is probably more to complain about, but I have spent a day installing and working with something that should be pretty much straight forward.  More later, if warranted.I would not buy it again.=============An update, with some technical hoodoo.  I used a 126 GB thumb drive as storage for the Sync Module (SM).  The SM needed to format it first : well, OK....  Days later, I wanted to see how well it worked, if what was stored was more than what the app showed me (not much, time-wise).  After ""Safe Eject"", I tried to view it in two PCs without luck.  The PC would beep, like it knew it was there, but no drive letter.  Long story, I spent four hours figuring out just how to get the drive back from the dead.  Disk Management choked, etc.  I was ready to pitch it.  What saved the drive was Diskpart, using ""clean"".  I have no idea what the SM is doing.  Maybe it can't handle larger drives?  I have a 16 GB installed now.  We'll see.---Another update, 2024-01-29.  I knocked it down from 2 to 1.  I don't often give 1 Star reviews -- there is usually something to recommend a gizmo! -- but not this product.•  Despite some very concerned and responsive tech support, neither the doorbell (DB) nor camera (Cam) would record for the desired and prescribed time.  Both would cut out prematurely.  The DB would often ""record"" for a quarter of a second, a mere flash.  The Cam would stop recording even as the person was walking past.  (I set up both for 20+ seconds.)•  That 10 second delay (the lowest it would go) was infuriating.  That is, if it records and stops, it has to wait at least 10 seconds before recording again.  What?!•  If you subscribe to the cloud, it does not record to the thumbdrive.  Downloading from the Cloud is tedious.  Retrieving from the thumbdrive is too.•  You have to use a Smart Phone (no Win or Mac app).•  I wired the DB to my current DB -- 24 VAC, and $20 for the wire -- but the only purpose of that is to ring the inside -- no power advantage at all.  Still need those two AA batteries.•  The SmartPhone app is kludgy.In short, these products are full of holes.  I sent it back.  Maybe the third thing I have returned to Amazon?  You might too."

After buying all of this you still have to use your cell to control and use all of it.  Blink has a large view area but they have to be right up on it to make it alert so if your car is parked 25 feet away and someone breaks into it without walking by the door first you are screwed but you can catch your neighbor in a fender bender when someone thinks you hit their car.

I had the free 1 month of premium features, and when someone pushed the button I got a notification on my phone.  Then when the free stuff was about to expire, it took me to Amazon to get a subscription if I wanted any of the services any longer.... of course I did, that's what I got it for.  So, I set up the best service it has, and guess what, everything stopped working as soon as the free period stopped and they started taking money.  Maybe there's a quick fix to this?  Maybe not.  Until the service resumes, it stays at 1 star, as it is useless now.  See top - FIXED.

Lewis","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2022","We have a front door that drivers keep leaving packages at despite an easy to read ""Please deliver all packages to back door"" sign mounted at eye level in front of the steps to the door. We also have a non-functional front door with steps, railing, and door knob all removed that they've left packages under. Sometimes even on the door to our deck on the opposite side of the house from the driveway (with no sidewalk leading there). We got 2 of these doorbells to see where TF they go in the front of the house when packages are not delivered to the back door as directed, and to monitor the back door. The front door had a wired bell with a bad button so it barely worked. The rear door did not have one so we previously used a simple wireless doorbell. After missing a UPS package that required a signature, we found the chime batteries were dead and decided it was time. With the Blink cameras we could at least monitor battery life via the app, and get alerted to a delivery if we weren't close enough to hear the chime. Or if the package was just dropped without ringing the doorbell.We love being able to see what's going on, or what activity there was near a door, and even get an alert when someone pulls into our driveway due to the range of coverage.However, the documentation is confusing. With both wired to our existing chime the cameras report ""external power OK"" instead of ""Battery OK"", so I'm not sure how to monitor battery life. Documentation on that is lacking, and the notification settings don't match what I see in Android 12. Documentation states the doorbell always runs on battery though, so the change in monitoring is confusing at first glance until you dig through FAQs for the official answer:The Blink Video Doorbell closes the power circuit of your existing chime system, it does not provide power of any kind. If the chime system loses power for any reason, the doorbell only plays the Blink Chime sound and your existing chime will not activate.I don't recall if this was covered in the FAQs/documentation I read before buying, but I found out during the install that I didn't need to make any changes to the wired chime like with Wyze (requires you to bypass the chime making it no long function so the doorbell can be powered) and other models. Install was so much easier than I expected, aside from having to run a new wire to our back door just to tie that doorbell into the wired chime. Now we'll be able to add another doorbell to our side door to monitor the deck without any wiring, and the sync module saves us the monthly cloud fee.Motion capture has been a bit weird. I have field of view blocked off from the house side of the front sidewalk to the top of the view to ignore the street and nearby tree branches. Yet we still get motion alerts from the occasional car passing by on the street. Seems more frequent at night, especially vehicles with reflective paint/stickers (police cars, school buses, etc). Front door view is kind of dark, despite a nearby street light, but I don't want to turn up the IR intensity if it'll generate more alerts from traffic. I also walked the dog across the entire front lawn (the whole area I have set to monitor) during the day and it did not trigger a motion alert.In the end, it's great getting the alerts we do. It was more than we got before, and the doorbell chimes should be more reliable now in addition to getting the phone alerts when out of hearing range of the wired chime. All for a reasonable price, with no monthly fees building up.Edit 8/27/2022: The ""false alarms"" for the front door camera due to headlights from passing traffic at night, setting sun, etc have been eliminated with an angled mounting bracket. With the doorbell angled down, those alerts have stopped. And its better anyway as it covers more of the steps down from the door."

For my home I set it up as wired because I had an existing doorbell. For my girlfriend I set it up wireless because I didn’t want to tamper with her existing wired doorbell. It works really well but I’m giving it a 4 star because it doesn’t connect with other smart home systems like Apple HomeKit and Google Home. And some features like person detection is gated behind a paywall subscription. Overall I like it."

Make absolutely sure you determine if your doorbell is Digital or Mechanical.  Pop the housing off and if you see 2 metal bars, one above and below, that is mechanical.  Plungers ding-dong those.  Digital will have no moving parts.  The quality is amazing, the view is beautiful, the sound is VERY high quality (I can hear a cricket from 100 feet).  What I LOVE the most it is NOT bulky and huge like some other brands!  Sits/Fits and looks very nice on my home."

I am paying for cloud service for both brands.  The doorbell camera notified me of an increase in their annual fee.  The fee covers only one piece of equipment.  I decided to take advantage of a Blink sale and am glad that I did.  It was easy to setup.  I did a wired installation.  It works with my indoor chimes and with the wired installation the batteries should last two years.The camera that I replaced was more expensive, even wired I had to remove the camera and charge it every three months or so.

Lost connection with WIFI and will not reconnect. Have been going through Blink support and all they can recommend is to push the reset button. Lights will not blink. Unit will not reset. Their support is email only and they take days to respond. Useless boat anchor. I definitely do not recommend, and their are many posts with the same problem. When it did function there was a big delay between somebody pushing the bell, and it ringing through to the cell phones. I have strong WIFI at that location.Update: Customer service responded to my review above. They sent a replacement unit. New unit functioned properly out of the box. I'm glad to see that they pay attention to their reviews and care about the quality of their product. While I'm not sure what happened with the initial doorbell, I would recommend the purchase because if there is an issue, they will stand behind it."

It connected automatically without any hassle, making the installation process a joy.While there is a slight half-second delay in touch response, it's important to note that this is likely due to Bluetooth connectivity. However, it's something one can easily adapt to over time. Despite this minor inconvenience, the overall performance of the Carplay adapter is commendable.What truly sets this adapter apart is the ability to enjoy YouTube and Netflix directly on the car's radio screen. This feature alone makes it a worthwhile investment, enhancing the overall driving experience. The convenience and pleasure of having these entertainment options at your fingertips during journeys are truly remarkable.In conclusion, the Wireless Carplay Adapter • 3 in 1 is a good investment that brings a lot of value to your driving experience. The slight touch delay is a minor trade-off for the convenience and enjoyment it provides. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend it to others looking to enhance their in-car entertainment system."

Another issue noticed is that even after the vehicle is turned off, if close by, the audio tries to connect through CarPlay, so I have to manually disconnect it, otherwise, it just reconnects a call back to it.

I'm using it in my 2022 Subaru Outback. It was easy to hook up.

Skipping to the next song is a delay of maybe a second. It's dropped the connection once in mid-session--I'll be watching to see if that happens again. And, although very minor to me, in the interest of thorough reporting I'll add that mine doesn't have a blue light like the photos.I've used it for only a day but already find it a completely necessary gadget.

I had a pair of AirPods that I used for years and they finally died and I didn't want to spend the money on new AirPods...so I bought these. I do a ton of Mtn Biking and trail running and I love them so far.Pros:-They pair immediatley on any bluetooth device.  You don't need to do the whole ""press a button for 20 seconds"" thing to pair like other headphones.-They fit great.  They come with 3 diff sizes of silicone ear buds. The default out of the box is installed with the medium buds and they fit great. Also, they are designed with an extension that wraps around the back of your ear which almost guarantees they will not fall out.-They are super light and the case is super light.-They charge fast and hold charge for a long time. I easily go over a week or so without having to charge.-The  sound is great and the controls are simple and easy to use directly from either side.Cons:  (Only 2 cons here but they both bother me which is why I am only giving 4 stars)-The charging case: As much as I love the lightweight and rapid charge...here is the problem: The shell of the case is SUPER slippery.  Like ""trying to hold a rainbow trout"" slippery.  I probably grab the case and it shoots out of my hands at least 5 times a day. I mean it when I say the case ""Shoots"" out of my grasp.  They need to use some sort of silicone on the shell. As a result,  I am looking for an aftermarket shell cover.-As much as I love the pairing...there is a downside: It automatically ""re""-pairs to the last device you used with the headphones.  If you want to use a different device next time, I find that I have to go into the previous device and ""unconnect"" the headphones in order to connect with new device. I use them overall with 5 devices- my iPhone, iPad, MacBook, AppleTV and Firestick.  It can get tedious...especially if you don't remember that last device you used. I know.... ""Champaign problems"" but still....Over all...I would 100% recommend these."

I decided to get some over-the-ear buds. I googled the best ones and these were one of the options. It also listed as best seller on Amazon. I was skeptical how good they would be for the price, but honestly they're great! For basic listening it has great sound. I switched to the smallest fitting and they are snug and comfortable! Only downside which is no biggie is the case is slippery and the lid when you open it feels flimsy and will easily close on you. But again, for the price I really don't mind!"

I use them mostly at work so I can only use one at a time. With the long life of the actual earbuds plus the charging case, I rarely need to charge it. Battery life deserves more than 5 stars honestly.I bought on sale both times and it has been one of the best money to quality ratios I have had.Only negative for me is that with both in it is hard to hear any outside sounds. I work at a camp so outside of summer there are only two to three other people here most of the time. Plus out doors I need to be able to hear some. That is why I usually use just one at a time. But that means it is great at blocking noise so that might be a positive for someone else."

Personally, I think that ear clips are a must for ear buds so they don’t fall out. The case is fairly small and easy to stow, but pretty solid & protective. Sound quality is fine.Battery life is excellent. You take the ear buds out of the case, and they automatically turn on and connect to your nearby paired mobile device. You put them back in the case, and they automatically turn off (which pauses the music on your mobile device) and start charging. Unless you make very heavy use of them, you can go for long periods without needing to charge the case. Just don’t lose the case like I did (sigh…).One odd design issue is that, when you open the case normally, the right ear bud is on the left and vice versa. I don’t know why they did it this way since it makes them slightly more awkward to put on. The simple workaround is to open the case upside-down, which is easy enough."

I have very small ear canals and I can't say how many other earplugs over the YEARS I've bought that just won't stay in my ears. I had honestly given up until this pair - for some reason, I took another chance as I listen to audiobooks and I can't play them in waiting rooms or wherever vs read and you get the gist. I was ecstatic.  I'm taking forever to write this review so I can help someone who may need it.The pictures and description on this website are accurate EXCEPT the color.  I picked the green but the green I got is a dark green, not the bright color in the picture I had wanted,  I had to just now hold it to the light and be sure it wasn't black. I got a 2nd pair bc I can't find what I did with them - nothing to do with the product. So looking at the 1st order geez only in August 2023 per past Orders on Amazon I  happened to pick the same green but it's not the same - definitely not.  I'm not exchanging them but I liked the other color - the one in the picture - much more. There is no color shown on the website that matches the color I received. I may call customer service and put it on the record, in case. So again 2 months ago I bought the same pair - green though I didn't remember - the order says the pair was $29 with a $6 off coupon for $23!!!The product now has a red tab where the buttons that you click to turn the earbuds on and off, volume, and answer the phone. There are now THREE BUTTONS vs two from before. There are two raised black buttons on the inside of each earbud and now there is one round silver button that powers the earbud.  It says ""power on"" or ""power off"" when you click the silver buttons, no confusion!  You can see the silver button on each earbud when you open the case.  Remember, this lets you turn on only one for use vs always two.  You need to ""pair"" these which is so easy, just do a Bluetooth scan. I just shook my head and bent down - no problem at all. It comes in a nice black plastic carrying case that snaps shut and each earbud individually fits in its place in shape (vs just loose inside).  I bought these again bc I couldn't remember where I put them.  At this price point (an unbelievable $39 then a checkmark gives ANOTHER 40% off at checkout equals just under $23!!!).The earbuds come in and MUST BE KEPT in THIS black case when not in use or when you're done using them. Without the case, you can't charge the earbuds,  The black plastic case when open shows you the charge % left from 0% to 100% (I'd say it fully charges in 2 hours. I plug the container in overnight.  It  does NOT need recharging often and there is NO GUESSWORK.NOTE:  WHEN YOU OPEN THE WHITE BOX which HOLDS THE BLACK CONTAINER WITH THE EARBUDS FITTED WITHIN, YOU NEED TO LOOK INSIDE THIS WHITE BOX FOR A SLIM WHITE PIECE OF THE BOX THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S JUST THERE TO FILL SPACE. HOWEVER, INSIDE THAT BLANK WHITE THING ARE THE EXTRA EARBUD SIZES AND THE SHORT UBB CHARGE CORD OF ABOUT 6-8"".  THE CASE IS THE CHARGING STATION INTO WHICH YOU PLUG THE SMALL SIDE OF THE USB CORD.I'm not going to do any more proofing or editing.  I am not associated with these earbuds except they are great for ME.  It literally took me over an hour to write this review.  Excuse any errors, pls."

I'll keep these because it seems good for audio books and walks, but they don't seem too good in general.  Worth maybe the 28$ for the convenience and battery power, and a good fit.  They're comfortable on the ear which is worth a lot for me.  But definitely not worth that full price of 70$, too poor and inconsistent quality for that much money.  If I had got them full price I'd get a return, but for the half off sale I'll keep them.Old Review: I just got these today, and they arrived charged.  I'm writing this review because I am very pleased.I am a soprano and have a high pitched voice, lots of mics won't pick up my voice.  This mic does pick up my voice and transmit it whether I am calling on my cell phone or calling with an internet phone proxy like discord.  The only time it doesn't pick up my voice is when I am doing something (like cutting cardboard, or folding cardboard, or moving bubblewrap, then the mic is too weak to transmit my voice).For phone calls, the mic works consistently, my voice is quiet but the volume does not fluctuate.Listening to sounds from my phone works great.  For music, it plays smoothly without static on bluetooth with wifi.  The volume buttons work on both sides, this is for both right handed and left handed people.One thing I found a bit weird was that the charging case said they were about 90, it was vacillating between about 85 and 95, imprecise, and stayed at about 89.  When I connected to my phone, my phone says they are 100% charged.I'll see how that plays out, I am not sure I like the inconsistency.I really loved the packaging, it was sleek and had clear instructions on how to make your waranty with the company Bmani.  The instructions for how to use the earbuds were also clear.  I'll probably keep the packaging until it falls apart like how I keep Apple packaging.The case the earbuds charge in is super sleek, it has a weak magnetic clasp that isn't difficult to open.  I already have insulation foam and just put two touch points on either side of the case to deal with the slippery ness of the case, which is making it a lot easier to keep a hold of the case while flipping the lid open and closed.  I'm clumsy, but other people could also benefit from having some silicone on the edge of the case to keep a hold of the earbuds.My ears are a big small, the around ear part of the earbuds feels a bit too large for me, but its comfortable.  I switched out the silicone earbud with the smaller size, they arrived equipped with the medium size and had a smaller and larger piece inside the packaging, it was easy to do when you use force to just bump the earpiece into the earbud.  I don't see the string they advertise comes to connect the earbuds in the packaging, I know someone else mentioned receiving that.Overall the only issue I have is that I did not receive the strap that connects the two earbuds to each other securely.  I have no idea how to test the sound cancellation quality.When I take off the earbuds and put them on the table, I can't hear my friend talking on my earbuds when I am 1ft away from them.  This is good, only you hear when you're wearing the earbuds, everyone in the room can't also hear your conversation."

They were also black, not blue, though if held up to the light and turned, there was some midnight blue visible on the charging case. Overall……very disappointed.EDIT:I was originally not sent a cord with the earbuds I ordered. I also didn’t think they were blue. The company reached out immediately offering a refund or replacement. They sent a replacement, this time complete with the different earbud sizes (got those the first time) and a charging cord. I am an extremely happy customer. I don’t often deal with customer service because I tend to rate high but this is BY FAR the best experience with any company/seller customer service I have ever had. They truly care about the customer. This is how online shopping SHOULD BE ALL THE TIME. So, thank you to this company. I have taken this to 5 stars and wish I could give them 10."

So I sent the original item back & just did an exchange. The replacement had all the parts.  I'm just getting used to them and so far I am really enjoying them. Noise cancellation isn't perfect, but does work better when the volume is turned up higher; sound quality is very good for this price point.  Haven't had to test out the battery life yet, but since I mostly use them @ work, I haven't had to challenge their lifespan before needing a recharge.  Overall I am pleased with these.  They are light weight and don't bother my ears.Little Updated after 3 days of wear - the volume control on the buds doesn't always work and changing out the eartips is a bit of a pain in the butt.  Overall - I am still very pleased with these.  The charge lasts for several days even with me using them 10-12 hours at a time.  I typically wear them at work (usually only in one ear) so when one of the earbuds charge is getting low, I can just switch it out for the other one.One suggestion I'd make to the manufacturer --create a place in the case that holds the additional eartips and charge cord - even if it means the case is a bit larger - it would be nice if everything was in one container so there is less likely to lose anything."

I bought my first set of these in 2021, and now have 4 of them.  They all still work well despite being exposed to moisture, the inside of my bag, travel to the beach, heat, etc.  The reason I bought so many is because I have ADHD and tend to lose headphones inside my bags and pockets.  When these went on sale I knew I wanted to get a couple of extra pairs so I don’t have to waste so much time hunting for my headphones when I left them somewhere.

So silly things like that don’t make it completely hands free.Besides that it’s reliable for not falling out of your ear as much as ear buds"

I always struggled to find a good set that stayed in my ears. Overall, this style suits me well, and I love the color choices (I got pink,) and their quality. I even got a set of these for my fiancé in green. Overall, I was, and still am, happy with them, just disappointed about their longevity.I bought a pair of these in June or July last year and started having volume issues a few months in. One earbud would be quieter than the other. I was not terribly bothered by this since I can manually adjust the loudness of one earbud in my phone settings, but it was frustrating since they were new. This persisted and eventually got better over time with routine cleaning, but eventually, and recently, an earbud just up and died on me. Had to finally get a new pair when the first could not even last a full year with just normal wear and tear.Despite this issue, they are still great earbuds. Great quality, lightweight, comfortable. Just wish their lifespan was not so wonky. I would still buy again."

"177","bmani Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth Headphones 48hrs Play Back Sport Earphones with LED Display Over-Ear Buds with Earhooks Built-in Mic Headset for Workout Black","Danielle","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2022","I bought these when my mpow flame 2s died. I see on Amazon there are a bunch of vendors selling various reskinned mpow models, but I didn't feel like taking a chance on overpaying for an inferior model (many aren't clearly labeled because they are trying to pass off as another brand entirely, so I don't know which model is which, in regards to old mpow model labels.) I went into these headphones expecting a comparable item, hopefully a little better, but not worse.Sound quality is kind of difficult to quantity, and everyone's hearing is different, but I find these to be at roughly the same quality level as my old headphones. It lacks a little bit of the bass the flame 2s had, but the sound is a little clearer. Overall a decent lateral move.I originally wanted wired headphones specifically, because I work during the summers with one headphone in, and the other ear free. These headphones can run with just the left, or right, unit in ear, while the other one can be in the case charging. This lets me use up the battery of one while the other reacharges, which is a big plus.The range is pretty decent for this price point, I get about 40ft unobstructed or 30ft with walls and such.The pairing was an unexpected bonus. It's very quick (both pairing to one another and to my devices) and when I want to put them away I don't need to individually shut them off and put them in the case. I can just take them out of my ears and place them in the charging case, and they automatically unpair and shut down. Same goes with taking them out, I just remove them, and they automatically turn on and pair to each other and then my device.Battery life is about what's advertised and the case battery hold multiple full charges. I use them regularly and find I only need to plug them in every few days. The case shows the case battery charge remaing.There are a few negatives. While the case will show the headphones charging (with a multi led indicator light rising) it doesn't show real time capacity. So, for example, there are 3 or 4 small leds, one set for R until one for L, that will turn on when you place the headphones in the case. It will flash the bottom light then middle light and last top, but that cycle will just repeat until they are full, at which point the lights turn off. They won't illuminate halfway when at 50% ECT. So I know when they are charging and when they are full, but not by how much, which seems like an odd choice given there are multiple lights there, seemingly to do just that.Another negative is the case feels very flimsy, especially at the joint. You need to be careful opening and closing, if you need these to last.Last negative I have is how the headphones hook into my ear. I need to have them tilted upwards (with the earband pushed further down the back of my ear) to get them to stay put. It sorta looks weird, like normally these types of sport headphones have the body of the until point straight ahead, and not pointing up towards my eye level. It's not a big deal, because they stay in decently well when fixed this way, but it feels like it's not supposed to be that way, at least compared to any other Bluetooth sport headphones I've used. These buds won't fall out of ear, but if I'm vigorously moving or talking, they can sometimes lose that tight in ear seal that gives the best sound quality and blocks outside noise. For my uses they do a good enough job though, and at least they don't straight up fall out.Overall I'm pleased with my purchase. I got them on sale (at time of posting) for around $26, which I feel these headphones are worth that much and a bit more. I'd probably pay up to $30 (maybe $35 if this specific style or brand had something others didn't and I wanted) but not more than that. These are decent budget headphones. I feel it's a good buy for money asked and would buy again. I hope this review can help some people decide on what to buy. In a sea of choices and reviews it can feel daunting."

The loop over the ear is perfect for me. The sound is very good and it's very clear on things like podcasts and audio books. There is just one complaint for people who like me want to use the same set of earbuds on multiple devices. The connection to the last used device is not broken until you manually do it in the bluetooth settings. And then you must immediately connect it to the other device or it will go back to the first device. I have not experimented with what happens if the previous device is not in range. But my bluetooth speaker (Wonderboom) does not have this problem."

In fact, they were already charged 92% so it only took a couple of minutes to hit 100%. I like that they make it impossible to miss the warranty signup.  The case has a seal/band around it with a QOR to scan.  Only had to fill out a couple of fields and your done.  The sound is really good.  Nice base and balancing. The controls are very simple with audio confirmations. You cannot ask for anything more.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the case.  It seems a bit flimsy. If you turn it upside down with the door closed and shake it a bit, it comes open.  Very minor issue.  Again, this had a big mark down and easily could be a $60+ product. Very wise buy for me as I needed a new pair for the gym but did not want to drop $200."

The issue I had with the original pair I purchased and then with the replacement is that the Volume + and - buttons don't seem to work. I tried both sets with the batteries fully charged and with iPhone and Amazon Fire devices and could not get the volume to go up or down. I tried holding down these buttons for several seconds, tapping, doing simultaneously...no luck. About every tenth try it displays a volume meter on the phone or tablet, but that vanishes in a second and there is no change in volume. The manual that comes with it indicates that all you should have to do is hold either + or - buttons to change the volume. All of the other features seem to work fine. One other thing to note: The pictures in the item description seem to show that the colors have a metallic tint of sorts. Both of the sets I tried (green and blue) has a flat finish. If you're okay with having to adjust the volume on the device that you are using vs. on the ear pieces these will probably work. I will use them mainly for listening to music, so I am keeping the replacement set. But even at a ""Deal"" price, the fact that the volume controls don't work, makes this an average value in my opinion. BTW, I looked online to troubleshoot the volume issue without success. Appreciate if anyone or the manufacturer has some suggestions."

    Love it. I'm not good at asymbeling and this was super easy. Just do one step At a time and read the notes per step. Last gamer chair I had was a titan secret lab  and this was as comfy as that. The armbars don't move but that wasn't a problem for me.the footrest is just a easy sliding bar that doesn't really extend to far but still worked for me. The headrest is OK but is not luxury comfort. Having said all that for the money and ease of setup it's a great deal for under $200. The chair is really comfortable the recliner steadily stops at several recline positions. If you knew what you were doing 100 percent you could set this chair up I'm 10 minutes but with reading it's probably a 40 minute setup. When you connect the top to the bottom there is a slot at the bottom the top fits in so you can easily screw the screws in with one person. No extra tools required or needed. While it's not premium luxury it is a really really comfortable chair and even has a massager that uses USB. Its not super strong but it does a good job. Only complaint it's a little loud but not deafening. If your looking to spend under 200 and need a one person setup I highly recommend this chair! Delivery was also fast! It's a little intimidating when first opening but the directions were fairly easy to follow. Had a few extra screws in the end but I think they are just backups. Just buy it lol.

    Highly adjustable for seating and reclining preference. The chair and parts do not feel cheap or like it won't last long. The reclining feature has a lock to set it exactly where you want it. The bottom back pad has a vibrating feature which while not like a massage chair, feels nice to use. Too many gaming/computer chairs are way overpriced; for what you get, this chair is a solid purchase. May not fit larger legs or waist, (I'm 230lbs, 250lbs would be the upper limit for seat space between arm rests). On the stiff side, but with back and head cushion.

    I got this chair on sale for $110 (not counting shipping) which I recommend you do.Assembly: It took barely an hour to put together and could’ve honestly been quicker than that had I not been multitasking. It’s incredibly easy/simple to assemble, a child (of good enough strength to tighten the screws and lift the chair) could build this. Despite it’s simplistic construction is feels smooth and sturdy.Experience: initially, it felt cheap. The sides of the backing of the chair feel as though they are lined with pool noodles, which threw me off at first. I was worried the chair was going to be stiff or uncomfortable. However, I was pleasantly surprised! It’s very comfortable to sit in, and the telescoping arms and foot rest are incredibly appreciated. I will say the plastic of the arms feels on the cheaper side and they already seemed a little wobbly shortly after construction. This can likely be amended by tightening the screws. The lumbar support pillow sits a little low for me, so I wish it adjusted to an even higher point, but I will say I am rather curvy so that’s likely a me problem. The headrest pillow is very nice and the backrest reclines and locks well, doesn’t feel wobbly or like it’s going to tip backwards. The chair also sits very low which was wonderful since it fit under my bunk bed, *and* fit my legs comfortably under my desk, which is impressive since most others do not (I have thicker thighs).Summary: I think this chair is definitely one of the best on the market for the price point. It’s not exactly top of the market quality but that’s to be expected for only $110. I would expect slightly better quality if I were paying the full $200 for it, though. Recommended on sale, and especially for those on more of a budget. Exceeded expectation. 8/10

    This is a fantastic gaming chair for the price! The seller shipped it promptly after I ordered ,and when I received it I was highly impressed by the ease of assembly. The instructions are the clearest I have ever seen among my furniture kits. It is so comfortable as well, with the lower back pillow supporting my back and helping with my posture. Not to mention, it is quite durable and sturdy so far, holding up great to my ADHD-fueled spinning and rolling across the floor. I would absolutely buy this again!

    I've gone through a few chairs over the years. I've tried office chairs and 'gaming' chairs alike, but they always left me achy and would break down over the course of a few years. I take exquisite care of my stuff (frfr I'm a germaphobe) but I'd have chairs start to tear or fray and leave my back hurting SO bad that it'd make my stomach hurt. I can't say I have the best posture on the face of the planet since I am hyper-mobile but it was ridiculous. I decided to give this chair a try because of the reviews and it seemed reasonably priced compared to the Titan Evo chairs I was looking into ($800).Assembly: Took me a little longer than expected, the instructions aren't the best but are relatively straightforward.Comfort: Fabulous. I can sit criss cross. I can sit like a shrimp. I can kick back and watch a movie. I can hunch over to do my homework. OR I can even sit properly (sometimes). I've never had a sore back no matter how long I've sat in the chair.Price and quality: I'd say this is mid tier quality. A step above ""you get what you pay for"" and a step below ""overpriced gucci chair"" that most companies market towards gamers to price gauge the title of 'gaming chair'.Is it worth it? Yes. I think you are mostly paying for functionality here and not style or aesthetic. Just a generic ol' gamer chair.

    I should put a disclaimer first and foremost that I'm not a gamer. I'm a writer.... which means I do spend long periods of time seated in front of a screen. My last chair has been falling apart. That's beside the fact that it was generally uncomfortable and awkward to sit in. I've had my eyes on this chair for weeks. I've added and removed and re-added it to my shopping cart, lol. Read reviews, watched videos, checked out the Q&A section, etc. Finally, I decided to bite the bullet....so far, I'm pleased!Is the chair the most comfortable chair I've ever sat in? No. It's not even the most comfortable office/gaming chair I've sat in. BUT, for the price, I think it's a good deal. It's comfortable enough that I can see myself sitting in it for hours with no issues. It feels sturdy and the overall quality seems great for the price (though, obviously, time will tell).It was pretty easy to put together. I put it together in under an hour. I should mention that I'm not at all good with building furniture. Yes, even office chairs, lol. It's just not my thing. I've been known to give up after a frustrated rant riddled with one too many profanities. But building this chair was a pretty easy task. I still struggled with piecing together the back and seat portions of the chair (difficult when doing solo), but it was only for a couple minutes. I will say I don't have the foot rest attached, because I couldn't get mine to do so correctly, lol. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, though, as I was pretty indifferent about that feature.Overall, I'd give this 4 out of 5 stars. I took off a star for the footrest mishap. Everything is pretty good. I even like the shade of pink, which I was also worried about when ordering online. I would recommend!

    Have used the chair for a day now after building it, and I am pleased with the overall function especially for the price. It’s is not the best chair in the world, but it is a very good chair and a comfortable one. It reclines far enough to take a nap in with the foot rest, and a vibrating pillow on your lower back. The pillow on top for your neck is tops off making this chair very comfortable.I would highly recommend this chair if you need an above average office chair that’s not going to break your bank. for the price it’s excellent. Building it was easy too and not long, 45-1 hr and it a a short hour. Easy instructions as well.I will say if you are a heavier person I feel like this chair won’t support you as well, at least the foot rest . It says 250lb limit and beileive it’s because of the foot rest as it’s not held in the trails at multiple points, just one screw. Keeps it from sliding forward. Luckily Im I on The lighter side so the foot rest has been my favorite part

    I wanted to wait a week before I did my review and here are my thoughts.  For the price, this is a great chair and I'd buy it again.  I work from home 80% of the time and also play Xbox at night in the same room so I use a chair A LOT.  Previously, I had a cheap desk chair from Amazon that I got in 2020 when the world shut down and we were all working from home.  I'll just do pros and cons:Pros:1. Easy to assemble.2. VERY sturdy chair.  Metal frame and smooth wheels, height and recline adjustments are very smooth and natural3. Vibrating lumbar pillow is a plus.4. Recline is great and feels sturdy.5. Nice to have a pull out footrest.6. Very large seat cushion.  I'm a small guy and can easily sit with my foot under my leg in like a ""4"" very comfortably.7. Cushions on the arms are soft and great for sitting all day.8. Every function is very smooth and feels very sturdy.9. They give you some extra parts.  I was actually missing a couple washers needed for assembly and found what I needed in the ""extra"" parts.10. Neck/head pillow is soft and comfortable.  It's very small but definitely standard for most of these gaming chairs.Cons:1. Seat cushion is NOT very soft.  In fact, it's a little too firm in my opinion.  I found sitting for long periods of time, my butt getting kind of uncomfortable.  I'm assuming over time it will get softer but I wish it had more of a memory foam type cushion on top of the foam.  I got a cheap memory foam cushion pad for my old chair and am actually using it on this one which does help, but then that also puts your position on the chair higher.  This in turn makes the lumbar pillow lower than it really should be.2. The leg rest comes out easy for me (saw some people having issues and you need to make sure the mounts are straight when assembling, they are adjustable as you tighten).  However, the way the leg rest flips out to use makes it very easy for it not to stay where it's supposed to be.  If you rest anything on the inside part of the leg rest, it's going to want to flip into it's storage position.  If you have your legs straight this is not an issue but I found this cumbersome at times.3. It gets kinda warm.  If you're sitting with shorts on or I would imagine if you didn't have a shirt on for some reason (don't know why you wouldn't but you do you), your skin with start to stick to it a bit.  Obviously it's not like getting into a hot car in the summer, but just something to think about.3. Being a shorter guy I wish it did go just a tiny bit lower.  My desk at home is even a little higher than some ""normal"" desks and it doesn't fit under the desk even in it's lowest position.  I can make it fit, but it scrapes the arm cushions a bit and I could see that ripping them in time.  Certainly not a deal-breaker, but if you're used to storing this under your desk, this may be an issue for you as well.4. For the vibrating pillow, you must be connected via USB to a power source.  I'm guessing you could use some type of battery pack but there's also no on/off, once you plug in you're on until you unplug.TL;DR: Great chair for the price.  Seat cushion could be softer imo but function/style/stability is on point.  Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a gaming chair and don't want to spend a lot of money.

The instructions are the clearest I have ever seen among my furniture kits. It is so comfortable as well, with the lower back pillow supporting my back and helping with my posture. Not to mention, it is quite durable and sturdy so far, holding up great to my ADHD-fueled spinning and rolling across the floor. I would absolutely buy this again!

    I've gone through a few chairs over the years. I've tried office chairs and 'gaming' chairs alike, but they always left me achy and would break down over the course of a few years. I take exquisite care of my stuff (frfr I'm a germaphobe) but I'd have chairs start to tear or fray and leave my back hurting SO bad that it'd make my stomach hurt. I can't say I have the best posture on the face of the planet since I am hyper-mobile but it was ridiculous. I decided to give this chair a try because of the reviews and it seemed reasonably priced compared to the Titan Evo chairs I was looking into ($800).Assembly: Took me a little longer than expected, the instructions aren't the best but are relatively straightforward.Comfort: Fabulous. I can sit criss cross. I can sit like a shrimp. I can kick back and watch a movie. I can hunch over to do my homework. OR I can even sit properly (sometimes). I've never had a sore back no matter how long I've sat in the chair.Price and quality: I'd say this is mid tier quality. A step above ""you get what you pay for"" and a step below ""overpriced gucci chair"" that most companies market towards gamers to price gauge the title of 'gaming chair'.Is it worth it? Yes. I think you are mostly paying for functionality here and not style or aesthetic. Just a generic ol' gamer chair.

    I should put a disclaimer first and foremost that I'm not a gamer. I'm a writer.... which means I do spend long periods of time seated in front of a screen. My last chair has been falling apart. That's beside the fact that it was generally uncomfortable and awkward to sit in. I've had my eyes on this chair for weeks. I've added and removed and re-added it to my shopping cart, lol. Read reviews, watched videos, checked out the Q&A section, etc. Finally, I decided to bite the bullet....so far, I'm pleased!Is the chair the most comfortable chair I've ever sat in? No. It's not even the most comfortable office/gaming chair I've sat in. BUT, for the price, I think it's a good deal. It's comfortable enough that I can see myself sitting in it for hours with no issues. It feels sturdy and the overall quality seems great for the price (though, obviously, time will tell).It was pretty easy to put together. I put it together in under an hour. I should mention that I'm not at all good with building furniture. Yes, even office chairs, lol. It's just not my thing. I've been known to give up after a frustrated rant riddled with one too many profanities. But building this chair was a pretty easy task. I still struggled with piecing together the back and seat portions of the chair (difficult when doing solo), but it was only for a couple minutes. I will say I don't have the foot rest attached, because I couldn't get mine to do so correctly, lol. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, though, as I was pretty indifferent about that feature.Overall, I'd give this 4 out of 5 stars. I took off a star for the footrest mishap. Everything is pretty good. I even like the shade of pink, which I was also worried about when ordering online. I would recommend!

    Have used the chair for a day now after building it, and I am pleased with the overall function especially for the price. It’s is not the best chair in the world, but it is a very good chair and a comfortable one. It reclines far enough to take a nap in with the foot rest, and a vibrating pillow on your lower back. The pillow on top for your neck is tops off making this chair very comfortable.I would highly recommend this chair if you need an above average office chair that’s not going to break your bank. for the price it’s excellent. Building it was easy too and not long, 45-1 hr and it a a short hour. Easy instructions as well.I will say if you are a heavier person I feel like this chair won’t support you as well, at least the foot rest . It says 250lb limit and beileive it’s because of the foot rest as it’s not held in the trails at multiple points, just one screw. Keeps it from sliding forward. Luckily Im I on The lighter side so the foot rest has been my favorite part

    I wanted to wait a week before I did my review and here are my thoughts.  For the price, this is a great chair and I'd buy it again.  I work from home 80% of the time and also play Xbox at night in the same room so I use a chair A LOT.  Previously, I had a cheap desk chair from Amazon that I got in 2020 when the world shut down and we were all working from home.  I'll just do pros and cons:Pros:1. Easy to assemble.2. VERY sturdy chair.  Metal frame and smooth wheels, height and recline adjustments are very smooth and natural3. Vibrating lumbar pillow is a plus.4. Recline is great and feels sturdy.5. Nice to have a pull out footrest.6. Very large seat cushion.  I'm a small guy and can easily sit with my foot under my leg in like a ""4"" very comfortably.7. Cushions on the arms are soft and great for sitting all day.8. Every function is very smooth and feels very sturdy.9. They give you some extra parts.  I was actually missing a couple washers needed for assembly and found what I needed in the ""extra"" parts.10. Neck/head pillow is soft and comfortable.  It's very small but definitely standard for most of these gaming chairs.Cons:1. Seat cushion is NOT very soft.  In fact, it's a little too firm in my opinion.  I found sitting for long periods of time, my butt getting kind of uncomfortable.  I'm assuming over time it will get softer but I wish it had more of a memory foam type cushion on top of the foam.  I got a cheap memory foam cushion pad for my old chair and am actually using it on this one which does help, but then that also puts your position on the chair higher.  This in turn makes the lumbar pillow lower than it really should be.2. The leg rest comes out easy for me (saw some people having issues and you need to make sure the mounts are straight when assembling, they are adjustable as you tighten).  However, the way the leg rest flips out to use makes it very easy for it not to stay where it's supposed to be.  If you rest anything on the inside part of the leg rest, it's going to want to flip into it's storage position.  If you have your legs straight this is not an issue but I found this cumbersome at times.3. It gets kinda warm.  If you're sitting with shorts on or I would imagine if you didn't have a shirt on for some reason (don't know why you wouldn't but you do you), your skin with start to stick to it a bit.  Obviously it's not like getting into a hot car in the summer, but just something to think about.3. Being a shorter guy I wish it did go just a tiny bit lower.  My desk at home is even a little higher than some ""normal"" desks and it doesn't fit under the desk even in it's lowest position.  I can make it fit, but it scrapes the arm cushions a bit and I could see that ripping them in time.  Certainly not a deal-breaker, but if you're used to storing this under your desk, this may be an issue for you as well.4. For the vibrating pillow, you must be connected via USB to a power source.  I'm guessing you could use some type of battery pack but there's also no on/off, once you plug in you're on until you unplug.TL;DR: Great chair for the price.  Seat cushion could be softer imo but function/style/stability is on point.  Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a gaming chair and don't want to spend a lot of money.

    Love it. I'm not good at asymbeling and this was super easy. Just do one step At a time and read the notes per step. Last gamer chair I had was a titan secret lab  and this was as comfy as that. The armbars don't move but that wasn't a problem for me.the footrest is just a easy sliding bar that doesn't really extend to far but still worked for me. The headrest is OK but is not luxury comfort. Having said all that for the money and ease of setup it's a great deal for under $200. The chair is really comfortable the recliner steadily stops at several recline positions. If you knew what you were doing 100 percent you could set this chair up I'm 10 minutes but with reading it's probably a 40 minute setup. When you connect the top to the bottom there is a slot at the bottom the top fits in so you can easily screw the screws in with one person. No extra tools required or needed. While it's not premium luxury it is a really really comfortable chair and even has a massager that uses USB. Its not super strong but it does a good job. Only complaint it's a little loud but not deafening. If your looking to spend under 200 and need a one person setup I highly recommend this chair! Delivery was also fast! It's a little intimidating when first opening but the directions were fairly easy to follow. Had a few extra screws in the end but I think they are just backups. Just buy it lol.

    Highly adjustable for seating and reclining preference. The chair and parts do not feel cheap or like it won't last long. The reclining feature has a lock to set it exactly where you want it. The bottom back pad has a vibrating feature which while not like a massage chair, feels nice to use. Too many gaming/computer chairs are way overpriced; for what you get, this chair is a solid purchase. May not fit larger legs or waist, (I'm 230lbs, 250lbs would be the upper limit for seat space between arm rests). On the stiff side, but with back and head cushion.

    I got this chair on sale for $110 (not counting shipping) which I recommend you do.Assembly: It took barely an hour to put together and could’ve honestly been quicker than that had I not been multitasking. It’s incredibly easy/simple to assemble, a child (of good enough strength to tighten the screws and lift the chair) could build this. Despite it’s simplistic construction is feels smooth and sturdy.Experience: initially, it felt cheap. The sides of the backing of the chair feel as though they are lined with pool noodles, which threw me off at first. I was worried the chair was going to be stiff or uncomfortable. However, I was pleasantly surprised! It’s very comfortable to sit in, and the telescoping arms and foot rest are incredibly appreciated. I will say the plastic of the arms feels on the cheaper side and they already seemed a little wobbly shortly after construction. This can likely be amended by tightening the screws. The lumbar support pillow sits a little low for me, so I wish it adjusted to an even higher point, but I will say I am rather curvy so that’s likely a me problem. The headrest pillow is very nice and the backrest reclines and locks well, doesn’t feel wobbly or like it’s going to tip backwards. The chair also sits very low which was wonderful since it fit under my bunk bed, *and* fit my legs comfortably under my desk, which is impressive since most others do not (I have thicker thighs).Summary: I think this chair is definitely one of the best on the market for the price point. It’s not exactly top of the market quality but that’s to be expected for only $110. I would expect slightly better quality if I were paying the full $200 for it, though. Recommended on sale, and especially for those on more of a budget. Exceeded expectation. 8/10

Connecting the top part of the chair to the bottom part is a .... but it would've been easier if I had someone to help me.Pros: color is cute, armrest can be used lying down on the chair, neck pillow and back pillow is comfy, back pillow can massage, footrest, chair is comfy on my butt(very important I had to buy a butt pillow for my last chair)can be improved: wish there was a royal blue or lighter blue option, the armrest can't be adjusted lower or higher( I prefer it to be a bit higher), no on/off button on the massage pillow

    This chair would have been easier to put together if the screws would have been in easier packaging to open. The pictures are super small and once you get the screws out of the package it is hard to figure out which ones to use. Otherwise the chair was easy to assemble. It just took longer because of the packaging.

    Not bad, quality fits the price, easy to assemble. The lumbar massage pillow is a simple vibration, nothing fancy but it does feel good after doing some deadlifts or fight sports. Took me about 40min to assemble myself. The fabric option would probably be easier to maintain, because the fuax leather gets marked easier with sweat, its easy to clean, but I'll probably have to do it often.

    My boyfriend and I both got these and they are great, they don't take up much space and the colors are really nice. Super simple assembly though it seems a little intimidating. The footrest is a game changer. My only critique would be the neck and lumbar pillows do need to be adjusted every time you sit or move off of them but, it only takes a second so it's not a huge deal.

    Now I was super excited to receive this chair I ordered for My Son . It came a day early. God bless the delivery man who brought it up my stairs cause it was a heavy box. Putting together was very simple. It took me about a whole 40 minutes to put it together by myself, the chair itself was so comfortable literally between the leg rest and be able to recline all the way back. You could just fall asleep in the massaging pillow. Very nice touch. I am very very happy with this product.

    I like the chair and it seems well built. I have only had it about a week so time will tell. I use this chair in my home office which doubles as my gaming room. I had a big comfortable office chair that this is replacing. I will say this gaming chair is not as comfortable as my office chair. It doesn't rock back, but the back is adjustable and the lumbar massage pillow is nice, but there is no control for it. It's on or off and always on full vibration. I am 6' tall and 200lb and I think if I was any bigger this chair wouldn't work for me. I think a little more padding in the seat would be a nice upgrade. Like I said time will tell do I will update this review after I have used it for some time.

    This is a fantastic gaming chair for the price! The seller shipped it promptly after I ordered ,and when I received it I was highly impressed by the ease of assembly. The instructions are the clearest I have ever seen among my furniture kits. It is so comfortable as well, with the lower back pillow supporting my back and helping with my posture. Not to mention, it is quite durable and sturdy so far, holding up great to my ADHD-fueled spinning and rolling across the floor. I would absolutely buy this again!

    I bought 4 different DisplayPort KVM switches to use with one of my PC and Dell laptop with dock station. So far this one is the best. Build quality is excellent. KVM works fine, it's very stable. Picture quality is outstanding, no lags, no flickering. I also like how solid is remote control connection (see on the picture) compare to usual frail micro-USB sockets.I use 3 Dell 4k 60Hz monitors, U3219Q and two S2721QS. I do not see any difference if monitors connected directly to PC/laptop or through KVM switch. There is some delay when switching between computers but that is expected.I also tested with DP to HDMI adapter, with DP to USB-C and USB-C to DP adapters. KVM switch handles that just fine, without any problems. If you like connect input to USB-C with adapter, or/and if you like connect output to HDMI or USB-C instead of DP with adapters then it also works just fine.So I highly recommend this KVM switch for using with 3 or less monitors even with different video inputs (adding adapters).A few suggestions to further improve this very good product. First, I'd like it to have bottom silicon pads. Then PC1/PC2 LED indicators are quite small, not very visible. Also when remote control is connected, its plug make awkward access to switch button for right-handed users. And finally common problem for almost all KVM switches: please make at least one USB output on the rear or on the side. I didn't test with 8K connections and I'll update this review when I have a chance.You can buy this KVM switch with confidence. It's a high quality, works excellent and has 2 years warranty with registration.

    My arrangement: The Linux Mint v21.2 computer (6th gen i5) has a Nvidia GTX 1650 video card with 2 HDMI outputs and 1 DisplayPort. The Windows 11 computer (12th gen i5) has a Nvidia 1070Ti video card with 1 HDMI output and 2 DisplayPorts.  Not using its third DisplayPort.  I am using three ""Display port to HDMI"" cable adapters in the system.  Results with this KVM are good, but not stellar.1) Occasionally, the arrangement of active windows on the three displays gets rearranged when switching from one computer to the other.  Linux is more stable than Windows in this respect.2) I can bring the Linux computer out of sleep using  a key press, but not the Windows computer.  I have to push its power switch to bring it out of standby.  Occasionally a key press will work.  - update: This behavior seems dependent upon the position of the KVM switch when the computers are shutdown.  The computer  that is not selected by the KVM switch during shutdown appears to not be able to come out of standby with a keyboard key press.3) The Linux computer got confused once using this KVM, and would not display video.  Had to reboot.4) I also tested a Razer Blackwidow Pro 3 keyboard with this KVM.  Fully functional in Windows.  In Linux, using the OpenRazer driver with Polychromatic, full functionality did not occur.  Probably the driver, not the KVM. Keyboard and static colors worked, some dynamic themes, but not the multimedia controls.  Static colors are OK, but I need these multimedia keys and volume control.  Will look for a different keyboard.5) No degradation in screen quality using this KVM.  Resolution is 1920x1080 for each of the three monitors.6) Switching time is about 5 seconds for 2 of the 3 monitors.  The third monitor takes about 7 seconds to switch.  All monitors are same brand and model (AOC 2425SWD).It works well enough for my purposes and is relatively inexpensive.  Not returning.  This was my second one.  I returned the first one because its behavior was quite chaotic, and it would lose the third monitor occasionally.* * * * * *Update - After posting this review, I was contacted by the company.  I received an apology from the company for this product not performing as well as expected, and they gave me a full refund.  And I was also was told there was no need to return the switch.  This is incredible customer service, totally unexpected.As I stated before, despite the quirks in behavior with my setup, it does work well enough.  I do get an occasionally movement of applications when switching computers, and coming out of Standby mode works on 1 of the 2 computers (most of the time).  On the plus side, there is no degradation in video quality using the switch, a Razer gaming keyboard worked mostly correctly (see details above), and switching speed is tolerable at 5-7 seconds.  So would I recommend this switch?  Yes, because it gives sufficiently good performance at its price point.  And customer service is surprisingly good.

    So I have a strange setup; a triple monitor setup on my PC and I added a MacMini to the mix which only needs to output to the middle monitor (the big one).  My PC runs three, the Mac Mini - one.  To top it off, the right hand side is in portrait mode for my email.  Still I have to have two keyboards which was a pain.  I’m an IT professional and not a gamer.  I do tubes and recordings on the MacMini so one screen in the center is enough.  My PC has one HDMI and 3 Display Ports (DP).  You can daisy chain DPs but that wouldn’t have helped in this setup.  The MacMini has an HDMI and several USB-C ports - one of which I made into a DP with a USB-C to DP cable.  Sooooo…the inputs on this device are one HDMI and one DP and USB from each machine and one HDMI and one DP on the outputs.  Since I am only changing the center monitor (the big beautiful one) for the audio/video work I just routed a single DP from each computer to the device (plus a USB for keyboard and mouse) and used just the DP output port to the big monitor in the center.  This works flawlessly, albeit it takes a few seconds for Windows to figure out how many monitors it has before it rearranges the screen. The icons do NOT rearrange themselves each time so that was good.  Figuring out which monitor is your MAIN display is the toughest problem for the Windows machines.  When I’m in PC mode, I have the DP routed to the KVM for the center monitor and the other two DPs directly plugged into he side monitors (left side - landscape, right side - portrait).  When I switch to the MacMini, the center monitor is no longer connected to the PC (according to Windows) and the left and right displays (monitors) hemorrhage a little before settling on two displays while the MacMini shows up on the center monitor - as planned.  So, it works and for the price - a great solution for my rig.  Hope this was helpful albeit I’m sure confusing.  The unit works as advertised; you just need to be on your game when PLANNING the monitor configurations unless you just go straight TWO in TWO out.  This was not my case and I didn’t want to pay $400 for a triple monitor KVM!

    I've been tinkering for about two hours trying to get a mobile workstation and desktop workstation to connect using the KVM 3DP version of this product.  I have only been able to get the display for the desktop workstation to show on three monitors.  That PC is Win10-64 and has an AMD W7000 which has 4 display ports.  My mobile workstation is Win11-64 and has an NVIDIA RTX5000 which needs a dock via thunderbolt in order to have enough display ports to send three signals to the DisplayPort KVM switch 2x3.  There is no mention of a single feed running all three display port outs.What worked for me:  1) I can see the three monitors of the desktop workstation only. 2) The button to change PCs on the front of the device and the push button changer.  When switching though all monitors go to sleep after a couple seconds because the unit doesn't appear to be getting any signal from the second PC.What doesn't work for me:  1a) NONE of the 4 'front' USB ports, (for a keyboard, mouse, printer and hard drive work).  1b) I tried wireless fobs and 1c) a wired keyboard.  1d) I tried connecting the USB unifying hubs directly to the PC's in an attempt to initialize them to the respective computers, but no luck.  2a) No lights appear identifying PC1 or PC2 'in use'.  2b) Checked the power supply, tried different sources, plugged in multiple times.  2c) Of course, 'turned it off and on again' numerous times.  2d) tries swapping cables between the one that worked with the one that didn't.Unhappy with:A) Obviously it's not working as advertised.  It is literally an expensive doorstop.B) All the USB ports appear 'loose'.  The cables or fobs are loose when inserted.  It makes me feel like a good connection doesn't exist.  I tried wiggling to get a connection, but shouldn't have to.C) The 'User Manual' consists of an 8 page 3""x3.5"" double-sided English-German language folded pamphlet.  There are no model numbers, phone numbers, companies, etc...  it is about as generic as you can get.  So there is no way to look it up online and try to debug.D) Under features it says 'Support Windows/Vista/XP and mac OS, Linux and Unix, Plug and Play.  It does not mention Windows 10 or 11.I would gladly update this review if someone would contact me from the company.  Tried the troubleshooting through Amazon returns, that was 5 minutes of my life I would like back.Perhaps this is one bad device, or there are a bunch of false posts, misleading people to purchase these?  I hope it's the prior.

    I was looking for a KVM that would reliable allow me to share three 144Hz+ DisplayPort monitors with two computers and the only solutions I could find were extremely expensive. Most of the available KVM switches that support three monitors have two DisplayPort and one HDMI. I do not want that because my monitors only support 60Hz when HDMI is used. Then I found this one, and I am glad that I did. It works flawlessly. My center monitor is 165Hz and the left and right are 144Hz. All three monitors operate at full speed. I cannot find anything to complain about how it works. Switching between computers is as simple as pressing the button.The included USB cables are a little bit shorter than I would like them to be, but they are long enough to reach both computers. An extra foot would be useful. There isn't any slack and I cannot move the computers without unplugging the USB or dragging the KVM out of place on my desk. But, that is a small complaint. I am very plesed with the purchase.

    Long story short, I bought a couple modern computers for my home office for use in software development, and I ended up buying about 4 KVM switches to connect my gear. I have a Mac Mini M2 Pro with Thunderbolt 4 and a Dell Workstation with RTX graphics using DP 1.4. This is KVM number 4, and I did a quick down and dirty setup late last night to see if it works.Start with the BadI'll start with the bad, which is I can fire up the Mac Mini, run some apps, then push the button for the Dell, fire up some apps, then go back to the Mac Mini, and the Primary Monitor loses it signal. But wait ... there is hope ... where I can use the power switch in back and toggle it, then the Mac Primary Monitor fires up and is back, with all apps still in place. So it's made for 3 monitors, but I'm using 2, and I'm not sure if that's an issue or not, hope not.Now the Rest which is betterWhen holding and looking at the box, it borders between being very well built but declines to just good enough in terms of build quality. It's on the good or better side of cheap as far as build goes, but excels more in logic or design and practical use. In other words, it more thought out in terms of modern use in 2024, where all the USB ports are 3.0, and all the DP ports support 1.4.I used some Silkland cables, mostly 16K braided, and some 8K braided Thunderbolt to DP, and the video signal is awesome, doesn't seem degraded. Switching between computers takes about 5 seconds. The Mac sees 2 monitors, along with the Dell. Resolutions are supported as if the box is not there.Early ConclusionI have one more KVM to test, a 2 computer 2 monitor one by KCEVE. It's cheaper, looks better with branding, but same build quality, perhaps a little better. If the KCEVE works 100%, I'll probably keep that one. But I want to keep this one because it supports 3 monitors. I can live with having to turn it off and back on, but I'll put a couple of hours into a solution to make it perfect in operation. This KVM switch is simple, basic, and has the modern stuff for modern computers to fully work as intended, and that's about it.Lessons I learned, why I bought 4 KVM switchesWell unlike the old days of VGA, where it's obvious that you need a port for every piece of glass, some protocols like DP allow daisy chaining, so I thought I could get away with a 2 computer and one monitor KVM switch. But I ran into issues like the mouse being boxed into the primary monitor using the Mac, and only being able to mirror the display with the Mac, and only certain USB ports being active with the Mac. On the PC side, everything worked fine except for the USB ports supporting a Das Keyboard and Logitech wireless mouse. Those K/M ports on the back of other KVM switches caused other issues I never saw coming.

    EDIT:  I have been in touch with the seller who has tried quite a bit to troubleshoot with me and did actually help me fix the glitchy issue on my main monitor! My situation is just a little too weird for all three monitors to work on both computers because of the collection of outputs I have, but the seller has refunded me for the switch since it doesn't really work for my situation. They've gone above and beyond most sellers I've had to work with for tech stuff and I would not hesitate to recommend the switch to someone who has less weird stuff going on than I do. Added an extra star for wonderful customer support.ORIGINAL: I have limited space and work from home, with my work being done on a separate computer so I need to use a single desk. Before buying this switch, I had a messy nest of cables that connected each of my 3 monitors to both my personal PC and the work PC, then a cheap USB switch to change my mouse/keyboard back and forth. It was a pain to hit the button on each monitor to swap between the inputs when switching between computers. I found this switch which was far less expensive than another that I had found and had the correct number of ports that I needed. It works! Sometimes. On the secondary computer, I have to swap from DisplayPort to HDMI as it only has one DisplayPort, one Mini DisplayPort, and one HDMI port. The DisplayPort and Mini DisplayPort work fine, but it makes all three of the monitors bug out when I connect the HDMI port to the DisplayPort on the switch. When I go straight to the monitor itself from the computer, it works fine which is a workaround I'm using but is a little annoying to deal with.The other thing is the USB ports on the front of the switch. I have a keyboard, mouse, and wireless headset plugged into them. On one computer, they're fine. But on the second computer, when I try to join a voice call, I get an error on the computer that there is not enough power to the USB ports to make that happen and I need to move the dongle from the switch to the secondary computer. Again, not the end of the world, but annoying.And occasionally when gaming on my main PC, I'll notice my main monitor (UHD 2560x1440p 27"") glitches every so often with a small line across it's width which it never did before being plugged into the switch.Overall, the switch does what I want it to do with some finagling around; but I don't think it's powerful enough for my application in particular. Other than the few quirks, it does work as advertised. The build of the unit is super solid, metal - I was expecting plastic, if I'm being honest. If you didn't have as much power hungry stuff as I do, it would probably work fine.

    I've been using this for several months to switch between my work laptop and my personal gaming rig. The laptop is connected with a thunderbolt docking station. I had a little trouble with the peripherals not staying connected to the laptop initially but I got that worked out by adjusting the order of the usb ports on the docking station. The switching takes about 5 seconds, which is fine, but the screens allways reset to single monitor mode. So everytime I switch I have to re-drag any open windows back to the preferred monitor. Aside from that and the delay on switching, its working very well so far. I'd give 5 stars if I didn't have to rest the windows everytime.

    So...this was my 2nd KVM switch after thinking I needed a better one from the first cheaper one I bought. Nope, the issue persisted...every time I swapped from my laptop, to my PC using the KVM, my PC suddenly registered TWO mouse cursers...and I would lose control of the curser and it would go CRAZY on my screen clicking away, and zig-zagging in every direction. I had to reinstall WIndows the first time because after unplugging the KVM, I STILL had the issue.It turns out, because I was using a USB powered set of desk speakers, THAT caused all of the problems. I still really do not know why I had this issue, or the root cause. I Googled away, and the most I can get is either USB3.0 does not have entire backwards compatibility with other USB2.0 devices.My advice to you is when setting up a KVM, unplug all USB devices from your computer - and then steadily plug them back in AFTER you set-up the KVM. If you have any compatibility issues - you'll know fairly soon with the mouse.

    Update:The seller reached out and was able to provide a full refund for this item without a need to return it. That's great customer service in my opinion. For that, I'd raise it 1 star rating. I don't usually give 5 stars and the product did degrade overtime so I can't give it 4 stars.---------------->This KVM met my needs in terms of features. However, it only worked well until closer to 1 month in. It took me about 1-2 weeks to get parts for testing and it went past return date for the product so I can no longer return. I wouldn't say the price for this is too cheap either. I've had other KVMs before which haven't had this problem. I bought this one because needed support for 3 monitors.Summary:-One of my monitor would occasionally flicker. I tried replacing cables, tried swapping monitors but problem got worse and worse. Sometimes would continuously flicker while I'm working on something important or gaming.-Sometimes when I do a switch from one computer to another, it wouldn't recognize some of my monitors anymore. I had to power down and power back up the KVM to get it to recognize.-Sometimes switching from computer to computer, my wireless mouse and keyboard would also lose connection and have to be reconnected or power down and back to get it to connect.

    It’s working like expected for our two computers/three monitors and all attachments (keyboard, mouse, camera, etc.)  Note, you need 2 cables per monitor w kvm’s.  We didn’t realize that and thought it wasn’t working at first.  So go get extra cables now.

    I had no Display Port monitors so I use a Display Port to HDMI adapter on the Display Port of my video card to the monitor. I did not think this would be a problem with a KVM but I was wrong. This KVM (maybe all) will not work with a Display Port to HDMI adapter on the Display Port channel. To be clear, I connected the Display Port from the graphics card to the KVM, then used a Display Port to HDMI adapter from the KVM to the monitor but it would not work. I ended up buying new monitors with Display Port and HDMI inputs to use this KVM switch. Once I bought new monitors, the switch worked as expected.Bottom Line: This KVM switch works well if your monitors support Display Port and HDMI. If at least one supports Display Port, you are good to go. If not, be prepared to buy new monitor(s) or a different switch.Just for clarity, you may use a Display Port to HDMI adapter on the HDMI side of the switch. I am using one on my HP Elitedesk Mini, which has two Display Port outputs and no HDMI.UPDATE: After a month of use, the power adapter failed for the unit. I tested the open circuit voltage and it was correct but it was not able to supply enough current to power the unit. I had another adapter that had the same rating and connector. I used it and the unit works fine. I was unable to contact the seller and I contacted Amazon. They were only able to process a return and refund as the product is no longer in stock. I did not want to return it as the switch is working fine. I only wanted to get a new power adapter.

    The product did the job it needed to with it switching between my laptop and desktop real nicely. However, the cable switch didn't work in allowing me to switch between and I can not use my rgb keyboard and mouse and haven't tested a normal keyboard yet.Over all for the price and if it works for me with my 2 monitors it is good for the price point compared to the more expensive type of KVMs.

    This HDMI KVM Switch 2x2 is being used to switch computers.  I did have connection issues with a couple of the USB 3.0 connections.  With a mouse and key board plugged in, I would have intermittant breaks in the connections.  I solved it by plugging in a USB hub.  Now one mouse and one keyboard works on two computers.

    I am an experienced user of MacOS and Linux and needed a way to share two computers with desktop versions of those operating systems  on my 27"" 4K monitors. Frankly, I am blown away with how well this switch works.  It is well constructed and even has a remote switch that allows me to alternate between the computers with a simple button push.  It even allows me to use my Logitech MX keyboard and mouse for both without having to set separate switches on those peripherals.  This might be the best piece of low priced tech that I have bought in quite a while.  I highly recommend it.

    Update: very good customer service. Also: I eventually got the flickering to stop after tweaking the monitor's refresh rates. I also got a brand new laptop and this one runs everything smoothly at 60hz (that is, one 4k monitor + one old 1200p monitor). Hopefully this information is useful to someone else.All in all, this KVM switch is pretty solid, especially at this price point.Original review: I am using this KVM switch with a 4k monitor and an old 1600x1200 monitor. If I set my 4k monitor at anything more than 30hz, it turns off for a few seconds every 20-30 seconds.

    When I first got this KVM switch, it felt like striking gold, an affordable KVM to use my multiple high-resolution monitors for work and for my gaming computer. It delivered on its promises, performing admirably and offering exceptional value compared to its counterparts. However, this initial joy was short-lived, as durability and functionality issues emerged over time.+ Seamless Switching: The ability to switch between work and personal computers was flawless, greatly enhancing my productivity and workspace efficiency.+ Incredible Value: For its price, the performance of the KVM switch initially seemed unbeatable, providing functionalities often reserved for higher-priced alternatives. High resolution, high refresh rate KVMs are usually hundreds of dollars.+/- The USB ports on the front of the switch aren't ideally placed, in my opinion, I wish the USBs were in the back even if the box needed to be bigger (makes it hard to cable manage)- Durability Issues: After only a month of use, the PC2 input malfunctioned and ceased working, raising concerns about the product's longevity.- Display Compatibility: When used with my 3840x1600 144hz monitor, the display would occasionally flicker. Despite trying different cables, inputs, and monitors, I'm convinced this is an issue with the KVM. When I plug my monitor directly into my computer with the same cable, I don't have this issue.While the KVM switch offers substantial value and impressive functionality at the outset, potential buyers should weigh these benefits against the possibility of encountering similar issues that I faced. It's a mixed bag - a product that promises much but may fall short on reliability over time. I assume users with lower resolution displays won't experience these issues, as it won't put as much strain on the KVM.

    After using this KVM switch, I wish I would have bought one sooner.  So nice to use two computers and two monitors with ease, all while using a common keyboard, mouse, and camera.  Slick!  Setup is easy.  Remember to turn the KVM switch ""ON"".  I missed that step in the instructions initially and thought it didn't work, however, a thorough review of the instructions pointed out my error.  If you need a 2x2 KVM switch, this is an excellent choice.

    This KVM switch works perfectly so far. Reminder (I was confused at first): you need lots of HDMI/DP cables. For example, I have 2 monitors and 2 computers so I need 6 cables. For 3 monitors it would be 9. So z=x+(x*y)

    It has been 24 hours since I've set mine up with 3 DPs and the controller button that is connected via audio label does not work. I was hoping to have my KVM hidden for my setup but I have to now have it easily accessible since the wire connected button does not let me manually switch between computers. Also, whenever I do switch computers, my mouse will have to be unplugged and plugged back in to work.

    I purchased 2 keyboards for my gaming sons. The swapping of keys was easy. The keyboards held its charge well and lasted a day plus of frequent use (daily). The keys makes a clicky sound which is what my sons were going for.After a month of almost daily use, the space bar on one of the keyboards stopped working. There was nothing we could do to repair it at home. I reached out to the company via Amazon message and explained what happened. They replied promptly asking for a clarification of the problem and a picture of the problem. I submitted both and they offered us a replacement right away. It arrived in less than a week and works beautifully. They told us to discard the broken keyboard.The keyboard is good, but the customer service is excellent!

    I don't have much experience with gaming keyboards and I really just bought this to have a little more room on my desk at work, but I think it's pretty good. It's very clicky and while I do think it sounds just a little bit cheap, it's still satisfying to type on. I wish the lights were a bit brighter, but otherwise the variety of patterns it produces are fun. I haven't noticed any lag or connection issues, although I will mention that occasionally the @ and # are replaced with "" and £ seemingly for no reason. I assume I'm hitting some kind of hotkey that changes 2 and 3's special characters, but I've yet to figure out what I could be doing and it's JUST those two keys. At no point does anything else change what it types. It might even be a weird glitch, but it's rare it happens and it doesn't bother me enough to do anything about.That aside, I've been happy with it and I'd recommend it as a stepping stone for someone not looking to spend a ton on a mechanical keyboard. I think it makes a great starting point. It also came with additional red keys so you can swap them out if you don't want it to be the default color.

    Obviously there are better mechanical keyboards out there, but I don't think you'll find one for less than $30 better than this. I went with the blue switches because I am personally a fan of clicky switches. Following are my pros and consPROS-Affordable as hell, seriously if you have the money to buy a crappy membrane keyboard then you have the money to buy one of these- Ergonomic design. The back rows of keys are slightly higher than the lower rows which make for a very comfortable and easy to type on design. I usually take a few days to adapt to a new keyboard but this one just felt good right off the bat.- Consistent and decent quality switches. I've used cheaper keyboards before and they usually have some QC issues with some switches having a completely different feel from others, but everything is consistent and feels the same on this one.CONS- The switches sound a bit ""twangy"". There is a higher pitch sound to the switches that other blue's don't suffer from. This was mitigated by sticking a few adhesive foam pads inside the PCB tray, but without the foam the switches were kind of annoying, and I've been using various blues for 10 years now.-Variances in the different colored key caps. The keyboard comes with some red and black keycaps to replace the default grey ones, and they sound difference is STARK. The red caps sound light and metallic, while the blacks sound heavy and thuddy. I replaced the default grey space bar with a red one and it has a very very obvious sound difference from the rest of the keys.-It's not hotswapable, the entire PCB is soldered and doing any kind of customization is nearly impossible.

    I don't do well with the macbook keyboard if I am on the road for more than two days. Obviously everything needs to fit in my carry on luggage. This keyboard hits the sweet spot for me. I don't need translucent key caps nor multi-color lighting. USB wired is just fine. It fits perfectly at the bottom/back of my carry on. The blue switch is just what I am used to. The price is unbeatable.The frame is plastic, not metal. But it feels sturdy enough. Two levels of tilt adjustment by the folding feet.The included orange keycaps are fun. But some extra caps are obviously not for this compact keyboard, they may be for the larger one with number pad. I don't know if this is a mistake or they just drop the sam bag of selected orange caps.

    Feels pretty good for the price point. I thought it was the red switch version but it’s got brown switches. Must’ve just not caught it before I ordered it but it’s all good. Does what I need it to do. I’m not used to keyboard and mouse gaming really, so it’s still a bit awkward due to me primarily using an Xbox controller.But it does look great! And it has a nice weight to it. Doesn’t feel cheap either. Wish it was wireless but I would recommend so far.The spare key caps are not transparent lettering so it kinda messes with the LEDs coming through. Also a few extra red key caps that don’t really belong anywhere on the keyboard which was odd. I also wish that the keys that have dual function especially for things like volume were labeled. Oh well. Not a huge deal. Nice keyboard overall!

    Keyboard looks great and build quality is decent but feels cheap by times. Backlights is cold white , great and have diferent variations. Colors and design is great but there are some quality conmtrol flaws. I got the white-black and orange, out of the box it came with white and black key. Orange keys were packed in an extra bag wich is great but the miss is that the keyboard is a 60% so there is no number pad but orange keys included in bag include numb pad plus, minis, enter. Those ma be like extras but will prefered to see key that can be replace in the keyboard. Other downside is that the keyboard indeed is mechanical but it lacks of a spring that provide resistance to presure and key taping so key feel loose and whimpsy. For the pricepoint sure is a decent option but typing just feels like a toy.

    I recently switched to this keyboard from a larger one as my old keyboard broke, and this one was at a very good price, in my opinion. I saw many other positive reviews, and it reinforced my need to buy it, and I do not regret it. This smaller keyboard makes all the difference when gaming, which I did not even know I needed, to be honest, but when you buy it, keep in mind you are getting the best quality for that price. While it is not the fanciest thing on the market, it gets the job done and is a top option if you are in the market for a gaming keyboard.

    it's a solid keyboard & chances are, that you'll get a fully operational one, but i was a bit unlucky. the 2 key was very inconsistent. i had to take the thing apart & resolder the switch because the original solder was basically half done. the other solders were solid, but it's just not good enough. most people are not going to have the knowledge to troubleshoot such an issue. from what I've seen in the other reviews, their customer service department would surely make it right, but it seems like a big waste of resources when it could all be avoided with a quality job in the first place. I'm glad I got the keyboard working, and will use it until it properly breaks, but it is unlikely I will ever purchase another item from this company.

    Si es tu primer teclado mecanico no esta para nada mal. ya si eres exigente entemas de estabilizadores,libricacion,acustica. yo creeo que no es el indicado,pero por el precio que lo compre en promo esta bastante bien. (ojo cabe aclarar no es Hot Sawp y no le puedes retirar los switches con tanta facilidad).¿Lo recomiendo? Si si es tu primer teclado y quieres comenzar en este mundo de los teclados,o si solo quieres un telacodo y no eres tan exigente.(otra aclaración si te gusta el RGB y quieres un teclado RBG este no tiene RGB solo un color estatico en Azul que no esta mal y tiene bastantes efectos de movimiento).No soy un experto en teclados pero te dejo mi reseña,de lo que pude ver y probar del teclado. Y chico,chica si ya lo compraste que lo disfrutes.

    good keyboard, nice colors, but mine came with weird marks. the marks are on all the keys, but they're extremely visible on the white keys (they're way more visible irl than in the attached picture, my camera isn't great). they aren't hard to clean, a bit of wiping with a wet cloth or something similar will remove them, but obviously it'd be better if it hadn't come with these smudges at all. it's a fine keyboard if you're willing to clean the keys a bit.

    Look, this isn't a $100 gaming keyboard. But it *IS* mechanical, and it *is* a keyboard, and it's a great way to determine if you want to enter the world of mechanical keyboards. Nice glow, good feel, relatively solid. If you're used to keyboard with separate function keys and a 10 key pad, it may take a little adjustment. I've found it to be a great keyboard for gaming with a controller where you need occasional keyboard use for other stuff. A stellar value for the price.

    if you’re looking for clickey keyboard is the one. I had one before but I gave it to my brother and I switched to the red switch, but I got bored of it, and I wanted some thing that actually made sound and I’m glad I bought this, I love the different settings on this. It doesn’t change colors though well at least the one i got doesn’t. but overall I rated a five.

    I usually go after a full keyboard and was surprised on how much I liked the smaller version without all th extra keys I never used on my other keyboard.  Have used it for a month now without any issues. I use it for writing and for gaming with no problem at all.

    Wanted to try out a smaller keyboard to optimize gaming, but all other options were very expensive and I found this one and it’s great for the price and it’s pretty responsive happy with it so far. I did like that you can switch out some keys of a different color but they don’t light up like the others they look to not have the see though lighting effect like the other keys already on the key board

    Pros:- Small footprint on your desk- Nice travel and feedback - far nicer than a ""chicklet"" keyboard- USB-C connectivityCons:- I can barely read the grey keys, even with the backlight at full.  I'll likely return this one for one with greater printed contrast.

    Great product for the price, lots of programmed keylight options. Love the red switch board, tactile but not obnoxious. Can’t speak to the longevity of how well it will last but if it lasts for more than a year I’d say it’s definitely worth it.

    I am an experienced user of MacOS and Linux and needed a way to share two computers with desktop versions of those operating systems  on my 27"" 4K monitors. Frankly, I am blown away with how well this switch works.  It is well constructed and even has a remote switch that allows me to alternate between the computers with a simple button push.  It even allows me to use my Logitech MX keyboard and mouse for both without having to set separate switches on those peripherals.  This might be the best piece of low priced tech that I have bought in quite a while.  I highly recommend it.

    Update: very good customer service. Also: I eventually got the flickering to stop after tweaking the monitor's refresh rates. I also got a brand new laptop and this one runs everything smoothly at 60hz (that is, one 4k monitor + one old 1200p monitor). Hopefully this information is useful to someone else.All in all, this KVM switch is pretty solid, especially at this price point.Original review: I am using this KVM switch with a 4k monitor and an old 1600x1200 monitor. If I set my 4k monitor at anything more than 30hz, it turns off for a few seconds every 20-30 seconds.

    When I first got this KVM switch, it felt like striking gold, an affordable KVM to use my multiple high-resolution monitors for work and for my gaming computer. It delivered on its promises, performing admirably and offering exceptional value compared to its counterparts. However, this initial joy was short-lived, as durability and functionality issues emerged over time.+ Seamless Switching: The ability to switch between work and personal computers was flawless, greatly enhancing my productivity and workspace efficiency.+ Incredible Value: For its price, the performance of the KVM switch initially seemed unbeatable, providing functionalities often reserved for higher-priced alternatives. High resolution, high refresh rate KVMs are usually hundreds of dollars.+/- The USB ports on the front of the switch aren't ideally placed, in my opinion, I wish the USBs were in the back even if the box needed to be bigger (makes it hard to cable manage)- Durability Issues: After only a month of use, the PC2 input malfunctioned and ceased working, raising concerns about the product's longevity.- Display Compatibility: When used with my 3840x1600 144hz monitor, the display would occasionally flicker. Despite trying different cables, inputs, and monitors, I'm convinced this is an issue with the KVM. When I plug my monitor directly into my computer with the same cable, I don't have this issue.While the KVM switch offers substantial value and impressive functionality at the outset, potential buyers should weigh these benefits against the possibility of encountering similar issues that I faced. It's a mixed bag - a product that promises much but may fall short on reliability over time. I assume users with lower resolution displays won't experience these issues, as it won't put as much strain on the KVM.

    After using this KVM switch, I wish I would have bought one sooner.  So nice to use two computers and two monitors with ease, all while using a common keyboard, mouse, and camera.  Slick!  Setup is easy.  Remember to turn the KVM switch ""ON"".  I missed that step in the instructions initially and thought it didn't work, however, a thorough review of the instructions pointed out my error.  If you need a 2x2 KVM switch, this is an excellent choice.

    This KVM switch works perfectly so far. Reminder (I was confused at first): you need lots of HDMI/DP cables. For example, I have 2 monitors and 2 computers so I need 6 cables. For 3 monitors it would be 9. So z=x+(x*y)

    It has been 24 hours since I've set mine up with 3 DPs and the controller button that is connected via audio label does not work. I was hoping to have my KVM hidden for my setup but I have to now have it easily accessible since the wire connected button does not let me manually switch between computers. Also, whenever I do switch computers, my mouse will have to be unplugged and plugged back in to work.

    I am using a wireless mouse and keyboard. They work great when plugged into the computer. When they are plugged into the KVM they disconnected frequently for a few seconds, and strange things happen like shift being stuck in an on mode. Also the two cords that are sent were usb A to usb C rather than usb A to A. This did not work for me since I need the usb C port to be available.

    I got this in a rush when I needed a new headset. In hindsight a bit more research would have had me getting something else. As a precursor to the review I feel that it is worth noting that I am very rough on audio peripherals. I don't know why, but they usually last me about 6 months regardless of the quality and price. This is why I choose to buy at a cheaper price point more frequently rather than high-end less frequently.Pros:Price for the quality is greatDecent speaker/mic soundGood quality cable that is at least 6' longSits comfortably on the headStereo/mic to separate stereo and mic connector includedIn-line mic mute switch and audio volume adjustmentCons:The USB is only a power source for the blue lights on the headset (it is a bit misleading in its uses, but if I had researched it a bit more I would have found this out before purchase)The in-line mute and volume knob would be better with a mic gain knob as wellIt tends to make my head a bit sweaty (I have long hair and live in South Texas, US. So it is hard to find headsets that don't do that, but still something to keep in mind)The headset only goes on one way (The traditional right and left side is enforced by the mic only being usable one way. I know I am in the minority, but I like the mic being on the right side of my head)So this is absolutely worth the money, but if you are looking for a high-end headset this is not it. I know my cons were a bit nit picky, and I don't want anyone to think that I regret this purchase. I knew I was getting a quick solution to needing a headset, and I honestly got more than I was looking for. The USB lighting, while completely useless, is a cool addition. The only reason it didn't make it into the pros section is because unless you want to look cool on stream it is wasted resources.So, yea. If you want a good quality headset for a good price this is great for you.

    I've been using the G9000 headset for a few months now, and it's a solid choice for any gamer and works great for online meetings. First off, the sound quality is on point – I can hear every game detail, which ups my gaming experience. The bass surround is like being in the game! The mic is clear, and my friends hear me without any issues. It's also got this cool LED light that adds some style to my gaming setup. The only small downside is the plastic housing feels a bit cheap, but hey, it's a great deal for the price. In a nutshell, the G9000 is a winner for me.

    I was initially going to leave a negative review since the product was advertised as being compatible for pcs and I did not see a port for the microphone on the cord, however upon thorough inspection of the packaging, I found the corresponding port adapter for the microphone and audio for my pc. The sound quality is amazing for the value, and I've gotten many compliments for the microphone being ""youtube quality."" The mute and unmute slide button is a bit annoying, though. It seems to get stuck easily when I slide between on/off but it's not that big of an issue to me since most apps already have a built-in mute button. I also like that I can use this headset on other devices and not just my pc. The glowing light adds a nice touch.

    I have been using these almost 2 years before rating.They are comfortable and still work like new. I wish the microphone could bend towards me but it's only up and down.

I have to speak loud for gamers to hear me now.The volume doesn't get loud enough to hear people in my party even though on my S Series I have them max volume.I can hear them but I'd like it louder.The biggest problem is the usb A , to light the headphones up, and headphone jack are connected by a plastic block that prevent you from being able to light them up. See picture above.  So when I'm using these headphones plugged into my controller I can't light them up unless I use a battery bank. Non of my controllers have a USB A built in.

    My son goes through headsets like crazy. Usually they only last like 6 months to a year at best before the connectors start to go out and the headset needs replaced.Normally I get him the extended warranty on headsets but recently I must not have added it like I thought I did. When it went out I needed to get a new set and it happened to see an ad for this one online. I was skeptical given the low price and no name brand. But I figured it isn’t a huge loss of they were no good.I picked them up and let him try them. It only been a couple of weeks but he says the sound quality is comparable to other headsets he has had from turtle beach and Astro. He does think they look cooler too.All that being said, the real problem with headsets is longevity. I can’t speak to the longevity of these but the sound quality and look of them seems adequate. For now I’ll give 4 stars and can update later if they last longer or shorter time than expected.

    Decent headset, good microphone.  Didn't have any issues plugging it in, easy set up.The headset does stretch a bit, but doesn't recoil back, so if you stretch expect it to stay that way.The blue light is bright and continued to stay on after the computer was off.  I couldn't even get my phone charged when this computer is off, but the headset milks that energy.  The blue light is bright and will glow in a dark room, so cover it if you like darkness, but if you need a night light, it can fulfill that purpose.Cable twisted up too much.  Eventually, it led to the right ear set wavering off and on depending on how the wires lie.  So, it broke.  Lasted 33 months in total, need a new headset.  Hope this helps

    These are ok. I brought these because I thought I could separate game audio from game chat. No it cant be done. Secondly the cord has too much going on. The charging cord and the cord that plugs into the controller are connected together. Too much. You should be able to separate the two. Not to compare but I have another headset that the only cord used when playing is the one that plugs into the controller. Thirdly no a huge issue but I thought that the light stays on when gaming, it doesn't. Overall not a bad product just needs to polish up a few things.

    I bought this product specifically to use when using my PlayStation 5. I thought you charged the headset and the blue light could be turned on or off. That is not the case. You must plug in the USB somewhere to power up the light. Another thing is that the end of the headset chord has the jack connector and the USB connector separated in a y-split way. That means your jack connection and USB connection has to be really close to each other or you won't be able to use one of them as I can't on my PS5. The distance between the USB connector in the Playstation console and the jack connector which is in the controller is far apart and does not reach. I'll keep the headphones because everything else works fine and I'll use them when I play on my gaming computer. If this is not a conflict for your intended use then the headphones are pretty awesome and you'll be happy with them.

    After about 3 months of light use the 3.5mm splitter that connects the mic started coming undone repeatedly. I had to tape it together with Gorilla Tape. Not a huge deal to fix it, but it shows the quality of the product to say the least. The noise cancellation could also be improved. The sound quality and microphone are great for the price.**update** The seller reached out about the adapter issue and made it right. Excellent customer support!

    I've had this headset since November of 2023. It no longer works. I take care of my electronics so I know it's not me. The mic hasn't worked since December of 2023. Most of the time it wouldn't plug in to my controller. Poorly made!! It's not worth the money. Find something WAAAAAAY BETTERThat was my original review, above. I wish to change my review, thanks to the seller. They contacted me and offered a full refund. In my eyes, that's a generous human being. I had already used the headset for a few months. Electronics fail. The fact the seller gave me my money back was an amazing gesture

    Everything is great, sound is exceptional if your not using it at full volume. Only problem is that it is a is uncomfortable, it doesn't grip very well and could fall if you move too much. Furthermore after wearing it for a while your ears could hurt a bit but it isn't a big deal.

    Los auriculares Bengoo G9000 ofrecen un sonido decente y un diseño cómodo a un precio asequible. La calidad del sonido es aceptable para juegos, con bajos sólidos y un rango medio claro. Sin embargo, la calidad de construcción podría ser mejor, ya que algunos usuarios informan sobre problemas con la durabilidad a largo plazo, especialmente en lo que respecta al cable y la estructura física de los auriculares. El micrófono retráctil es conveniente, pero la calidad del mismo podría ser mejor, ya que a veces puede sonar un poco apagado o distorsionado. En general, si buscas unos auriculares económicos para jugar ocasionalmente, los Bengoo G9000 podrían ser una opción decente, pero si buscas una calidad de construcción más robusta y un rendimiento de audio superior, podrías considerar otras opciones en un rango de precio ligeramente más alto.

    Rating this is difficult. Performance and appearance is 5 stars. However as seen in the pictures, the cable is really long until you get to the last 10 inches. The last 10 inches splits off into the usb and headset jack connections. They are so short that in order to use it like this you have to hold your controller up against the console bc the connection is too short. I am going to order a USB extension cable to hopefully resolve this issue so I don't have to return the headset. The diagram shows the end of the cable where the split is being really long, but it is not designed accordingly.

    Pros:- LONG battery life. From a full charge, logged 9hrs while working from home and had 77% battery the next day. Great for those who may not be using this headset on a daily basis (or those who are and forget about charging daily!).- USB-C charging connectivity (A to C cable supplied, high quality, long length).- Lightspeed dongle is small and discrete.- Comfort: (YMMV... I'm a male in mid 20s with a medium sized head... I think?) after a few days of playing around with the ski band placement and earcup position, I finally found a setup that worked for me. I have stud earrings and found some higher positions of the earcups were originally pressing on my lobes and causing some discomfort. Switching the band to the larger position and bringing the earcups down allowed me to seat everything nicely without any discomfort. Wore the headphones all day while working from home and forgot I wasn't wearing my usual headphones (Beyerdynamic DT770... Which are my top choice for headphone comfort).- Logi GHub connectivity/customizations are decent. Simple volume, mic volume, sidetone (hearing your voice thru mic with no latency), audio EQ customization (with presets and custom settings)- Doesnt look super ""gamer-y""... a good plus if I need video on during a (professional) call.- Flip to mute mic is great. I dont like having to deal with a removable mic or a fixed mic. The hardware based muting of the G535 mic is convenient and easy and doesnt require much finger dexterity... Allows me to mute on Discord or Teams while AFK.- Volume wheel and power button are smartly and intuitively placed and sized. Only a couple times have I accidentally brushed the volume wheel with the hood of my sweatshirt, but this only clicks the volume up a notch or two.Cons:- Noise cancelling is pretty weak. No active noise cancelling (but you wouldnt expect that at this price). Not much isolation from surrounding sounds, but this wasn't a large drawback for me as I play in relatively quiet environments- Mic quality: its a 2.4ghz wireless mic, so you have the usual downsides. Reduced high end, thinner bottom end. Its fine! But clarity suffers a little due to the intrinsic qualities of WIRELESS HEADSET technology. Please note that THIS MIC IS PERFECTLY FINE FOR GAMING, WORK CALLS, AND OTHER GENERAL COMMS PURPOSES!- Sound Quality: its fine! I do audio recording and mixing, so I'm biased when it comes to any set of headphones. My Beyerdynamic DT770 have a very wide soundstage, clear highs, articulated bass, and balanced mid range. I spend maybe 12 hours a day using the DT770s and love them for everything (aside from being wired). The G535 are fine for casual gaming, calls, video watching, and music listening. The default flat EQ is very acceptable, and I only tuned it a small amount to increase the high end, soften some mid range resonances, and add some weight in the low end. The stereo soundstage is a little muddy, but all wireless ""gaming"" headsets that I have tried in the past suffer from this- I would liken it to feeling like you are underwater and the sound is surrounding you equally and internally. Again, these headphones are PERFECTLY FINE for gaming, calls, video, and music. I wouldn't try to mix any audio, analyze new music, or try to take in a renowned movie soundtrack with this headset. Again I'm using my Beyerdynamic DT770s as reference here (the cadillac of headphones in my eyes)- they excel at being wired headphones with articulated qualities for music recording and mixing environments (and theyre great for CSGO with their better isolation qualities).- No bluetooth, but I have a pair of galaxy buds that I use with phone/laptop... And I can always throw the USB lightspeed dongle in my laptop and crack out the G535s!Overall verdict: The G535 are my first forray into wireless gaming headsets, and I am beyond impressed by what it offers (especially for $80 on sale)! It is adaptable to many head shapes and sizes (both youth and adult), has an incredible battery life, delivers good audio and mic quality for wireless headsets (better than cheaper $50 random brands), has great controls (both physical and software) without overwhelming the user or offering too much unnecessary functionality - very plug and play. I would definitely recommend this headset to anyone looking to make a worthwhile purchase without breaking the bank (say, the Gpro wireless).

    I am a pretty serious gamer when it comes to playing Counter strike and i have tried about 6-7 different headsets. Ive always been weary on bluetooth as ive heard they are generally quieter than wired headsets, and my last experience wasnt great with wireless. i saw this one was on sale and decided to try it out. the packaging is solid and no damage at time of delivery. The headset came about 50% charged. The headset paired with the bluetooth dongle immediately with no issues. Now when i initially played CS2 with them they were quieter than id like/expected, but thats when steelseries GG comes into play. After tinkering with Steelseries GG and tuning the audio to my liking, it really made this headset shine. the sound is exactly what i was looking for. I often hear more things than the average player on my team. If you know teamspeak and know the sound of that is very monotone and straight to the point this headset is quite similar. The sound is just very raw and isnt trying to make it sound like a jungle oasis. You hear what you have to hear and thats just pefect for counterstrike. Now this headset is also great for jungle oasis sounds, music sounds beautiful through them and so do videos/movies/shows etc. if you have been thinking about going wireless i really really recommend these...

    My background: Saying I game a lot is an understatement. I probably spend about 30-40 hours a week on my pc both for work and gaming. In the last 10 years I've tried multiple headsets with different budgets ranging from $30-$150 until I settled with a budget Corsair headset for $40 for years. Over time I was having issues with Corsair and their build quality. The faux leather/vinyl material they used for the headband and ear cushions was absolutely terrible where it would crack and flake within months. This time I went for a change and decided on this Logitech G335.Pros:- 1 cable does it all. Plug and playI liked my previous Corsair headset that had one cable for everything. This one comes with a 3.5mm that connects both audio and mic together. I did try it with a USB adapter on my PC with no issues and also tried on my PS5 through my PS5 controller again with no issues. Installation was pretty much plug and play. I didn't have to download any filler software although I heard Logitech's software is pretty nice.- Lightweight, Headband and Ear cushions are sturdyThe headset feels comfortable and lightweight on my head, I have not experienced any headaches even after long periods of time. One thing that won me over on this headset was the stretchy cloth headband (is removable in case it needs to be washed) fits nice and snug. My last headset was flaking pieces of faux leather into my ears so I really tried looking for a headset with a different material. The headset does have a very plastic cheap feel but it is a $40 headset. I've dropped it a few times and I've seen no damage, so far so good- Good sound quality and micThe sound isn't studio quality but it's pretty good for the price. I don't notice any difference from my old Corsair headset and HyperX ones I've used in the past. My friends on Discord also said I sound a lot clearer in voice calls and slightly quieter but I think the quiet issue is Discord.CONS- No mute button or removable micThis was one of the features that I missed with my old headsets. The way to mute the mic is by flipping it up and you'll hear a small click. I feel like after many uses it may lead to issues down the road if you mute/unmute a lot. I ended up setting up a Discord hotkey to mute instead. The mic also isn't removable which isn't a deal breaker for me but if you plan to use this on the go, just know you'll have that mic hanging around.-No Sidetone?If y'all don't know what Sidetone is, per Headset Advisor Sidetone is a feature where a small amount of your own voice that's piped into your ear speaker as you speak. Any headset with heavy noise cancellation really needs sidetone otherwise you're yelling into your mic because you can't really hear yourself. This headset doesn't have this feature however it's not fully noise cancelling so it's not a big deal for me. I can still somewhat hear myself but it does block a lot of external noises. Lack of sidetone isn't exactly a con for me but can be for others that feel they absolutely need to hear their voice.Overall this is a great headset for the price. Not spectacular but dang good for $40. Most of these budgets headsets tend to give out after a year so i'll update y'all in about a year. Happy gaming!

    i have had numerous headsets over the years and these are the best to date.1 the sound is rich and clear2 the cushions over the ears are cloth, so you dont sweat your ears off. and get that irritation in and around my ears, comfortable!3 it fits my large cranium well4 can be used with the cord while charging or without, have used them all day and not had them drop out because of charge.5 there pretty sturdy, many others have failed on me by breaking at some little pin that holds the ear phone to the head set, these are much more sturdy.6 the ear pads block out all but the loudest household noise7 excellent price point8 this is a big one - THEY SHUT OFF AFTER 30 MIN OF INACTIVITY!! saves battery life!

    First, these headsets are great for those who use PC or Xbox One to game. I'm sure they can be used on anything that has a jack-in port.Side note for Xbox users: Don't get the dongle version of this headset if you have an Xbox One Gen 1. The USB ports don't work with any dongle devices.As long as I've been gaming, I've never invested in headphones. As far as first pairs go, I think it serves its purpose.The volume isn't the greatest, but I can't say if that's because of Xbox One, Discord settings, or the headphones itself. I don't mind that it has 0 noise-canceling features because it's safer that way. I've learned that noise-canceling devices can eliminate your awareness in emergencies (like if a family member needs help, or a fire happens in the house, etc.). While I know that it's unlikely those things will ever happen for some people, I live in a rough neighborhood where it pays to have all your senses present. Honestly, I can hear my friends just fine with them, but the unit doesn't have an eardrum-shattering volume. Probably for the best.I really like the way the set can be adjusted at the ear muff parts and at the head strap. I also appreciate that the mic can be turned off by just flipping the piece up. The way that the ear parts encapsulate my ears is also a nice feature. It's very plush, which is great for my sensitive ears. I can't use ear devices that insert into my ears--it causes massive pain in under 10 minutes, so having a device that never touches my ears, lets me play longer. The head strap is also a nice feature because it prevents the hard plastic portion from sitting on my head. If you've ever had the weight of a headset sit on your head for long periods of time, you know how much it can hurt.

    Used these for about an hour and a half and it's been nothing short of a horrible experience.The product looks great but at this price point, it leaves a LOT to be desired. It feels cheap and flimsy.Sound quality: It feels really tinny and harsh and flat at the same time somehow. The highs are really sharp and loud and the lows are lacking and very flat. I experimented with the presents and the advanced EQ and even after about 20 minutes of messing around the sound was awful. The only upside is that you can set customer profiles for different games but it can't compensate for cheap drivers. A pair of $30 Samsons or Superluxes is 10 times better at sound stage and sound quality overall.Volume: The volume is extremely low which is really strange. I am guessing with the cheap driver it introduces a lot of distortion if the volume is turned up and it's unusable for gaming since you can barely hear anything. The volume knob doesn't have hard stops so as you are using them you keep wanting to turn the volume up but it just provides an obnoxious beeping sound for 1-2 seconds letting you know you are maxed out. If you turned the knob a few times since it doesn't have a hard stop it will beep at you for 5-6 seconds before you can hear anything.The G Hub software tries to do some sort of volume correction as well so when you tab between windows it lowers the volume and slowly brights it back up which is obnoxious.Latency: The latency seems pretty good but during my 1.5 hours of playtime I lost audio twice completely for no reason. I was playing CS2 and it just completely muted itself. I switched inputs and the audio was working fine on my speakers. I had to restart the headset and unplug it to get everything working again.Microphone: I have had better sound quality with a cheap $10 wired microphone. It's crunchy and flat and sounds a bit like a radio.Just as a point of reference, I came from using a pair of SteelSeries Arctis headset from 2017 that are about the same price, and if those are a 7/10 the Logitech G535 is maybe a 2/10 at best.Horrible controls, bad software, bad drivers, mediocre microphone (at least it works I guess). The only good thing is the battery life (I am basing that off of other reviews since I only used it for a short period).At this price, you can do much better. I would maybe pay $25 for something like this to keep in a closet in case of emergency but at a $100+ there are hundreds of better options out there.

    I like the sound quality and the wearing comfort. I can easily forget I have them on. I don't use the mic so I don't know how it sounds to other gamers. I have only had them for a couple of months, so I'm not sure about the durability. They feel durable. I like the positioning of the volume wheel. Easy to find and adjust.

    Comfort? 10/10. Sound quality? 1/10. I bought this because my dog ripped the cable on my Razer V3 X apart after he got his foot caught in the cord and thought it was chasing him. I was originally going to replace it with another V3 X because I liked that headset a lot, but out of curiosity I decided to scroll through all of the other headsets listed on Amazon and saw that this one was only $37 when it's normally $60 and couldn't pass that up. My first headset was an old Logitech g930 given to me by a neighbor and I loved it to death (literally, it disintegrated) so I thought that the same could be true for this one. Unfortunately, I was very wrong, this headset's build quality feels extremely cheap for having a base price of $60; my V3 X cost me $44 and its build quality was eons better than this one! Not to mention you can find it at Walmart for like $30 most of the time. The sound range and quality of this headset felt tinny and cheap as well, all I could hear were base-y, deep sounds and hardly anything else; ESPECIALLY ENEMY PLAYER FOOTSTEPS!! There's no way to adjust the headset digitally either because it doesn't have any software! In comparison, my V3 X is way more dynamic and has always been reliable, not to mention you can adjust it digitally in Razer Synapse. Overall, I can see how this would be a good option for a console gamer, it's cheap and has a 3.5mm to plug into your controller, but if you're a PC gamer like me I don't recommend this at all. Go get a Razer V3 X instead!

    Windows 11 w/ Discordset up painlessly with GHUB.These are sooooo much lighter than similar headsets from Logitech, Corsair, HyperX.  I love the boom mic feature.  I found myself removing the mic from other brands to get them out of the way, particularly while eating or something and then of course, having to remember where I put it and reattach when I wanted to chat.  Discord seems to be cooperating and not switching between multiple instances of the hardware (I am on wireless/lightspeed dongle, with the headphones plugged into a usb strip that is NOT connected to the computer)

    I had to get rid of my old head set and got this one to replace it. Overall this is a good headset, and I enjoy using it for gaming. Sound quality is good, nothing out of this world, but still good quality enough where I’d recommend it. One this I will warn is the volume scroller on the side sometimes gets messed with I lean back or lie down to watch a show, but this is a minor issue that shouldn’t typically be an issue. Also the cord length is not as long as I’d prefer, but it’s still a good length and again shouldn’t be an issue for most people. Mic works well, but it’s a bit finicky and sometimes when I play games and flip the mic up to mute it doesn’t actually mute in game. Does work in discord though. Headset is comfortable and the color (I got teal) is wonderful. It’s my favorite color and it looks the same as the pictures.TLDR: Good quality headphones, haven’t had any major issues with it, I’d recommend them if you’re thinking about getting these.

    Pros:- LONG battery life. From a full charge, logged 9hrs while working from home and had 77% battery the next day. Great for those who may not be using this headset on a daily basis (or those who are and forget about charging daily!).- USB-C charging connectivity (A to C cable supplied, high quality, long length).- Lightspeed dongle is small and discrete.- Comfort: (YMMV... I'm a male in mid 20s with a medium sized head... I think?) after a few days of playing around with the ski band placement and earcup position, I finally found a setup that worked for me. I have stud earrings and found some higher positions of the earcups were originally pressing on my lobes and causing some discomfort. Switching the band to the larger position and bringing the earcups down allowed me to seat everything nicely without any discomfort. Wore the headphones all day while working from home and forgot I wasn't wearing my usual headphones (Beyerdynamic DT770... Which are my top choice for headphone comfort).- Logi GHub connectivity/customizations are decent. Simple volume, mic volume, sidetone (hearing your voice thru mic with no latency), audio EQ customization (with presets and custom settings)- Doesnt look super ""gamer-y""... a good plus if I need video on during a (professional) call.- Flip to mute mic is great. I dont like having to deal with a removable mic or a fixed mic. The hardware based muting of the G535 mic is convenient and easy and doesnt require much finger dexterity... Allows me to mute on Discord or Teams while AFK.- Volume wheel and power button are smartly and intuitively placed and sized. Only a couple times have I accidentally brushed the volume wheel with the hood of my sweatshirt, but this only clicks the volume up a notch or two.Cons:- Noise cancelling is pretty weak. No active noise cancelling (but you wouldnt expect that at this price). Not much isolation from surrounding sounds, but this wasn't a large drawback for me as I play in relatively quiet environments- Mic quality: its a 2.4ghz wireless mic, so you have the usual downsides. Reduced high end, thinner bottom end. Its fine! But clarity suffers a little due to the intrinsic qualities of WIRELESS HEADSET technology. Please note that THIS MIC IS PERFECTLY FINE FOR GAMING, WORK CALLS, AND OTHER GENERAL COMMS PURPOSES!- Sound Quality: its fine! I do audio recording and mixing, so I'm biased when it comes to any set of headphones. My Beyerdynamic DT770 have a very wide soundstage, clear highs, articulated bass, and balanced mid range. I spend maybe 12 hours a day using the DT770s and love them for everything (aside from being wired). The G535 are fine for casual gaming, calls, video watching, and music listening. The default flat EQ is very acceptable, and I only tuned it a small amount to increase the high end, soften some mid range resonances, and add some weight in the low end. The stereo soundstage is a little muddy, but all wireless ""gaming"" headsets that I have tried in the past suffer from this- I would liken it to feeling like you are underwater and the sound is surrounding you equally and internally. Again, these headphones are PERFECTLY FINE for gaming, calls, video, and music. I wouldn't try to mix any audio, analyze new music, or try to take in a renowned movie soundtrack with this headset. Again I'm using my Beyerdynamic DT770s as reference here (the cadillac of headphones in my eyes)- they excel at being wired headphones with articulated qualities for music recording and mixing environments (and theyre great for CSGO with their better isolation qualities).- No bluetooth, but I have a pair of galaxy buds that I use with phone/laptop... And I can always throw the USB lightspeed dongle in my laptop and crack out the G535s!Overall verdict: The G535 are my first forray into wireless gaming headsets, and I am beyond impressed by what it offers (especially for $80 on sale)! It is adaptable to many head shapes and sizes (both youth and adult), has an incredible battery life, delivers good audio and mic quality for wireless headsets (better than cheaper $50 random brands), has great controls (both physical and software) without overwhelming the user or offering too much unnecessary functionality - very plug and play. I would definitely recommend this headset to anyone looking to make a worthwhile purchase without breaking the bank (say, the Gpro wireless).

    I am a pretty serious gamer when it comes to playing Counter strike and i have tried about 6-7 different headsets. Ive always been weary on bluetooth as ive heard they are generally quieter than wired headsets, and my last experience wasnt great with wireless. i saw this one was on sale and decided to try it out. the packaging is solid and no damage at time of delivery. The headset came about 50% charged. The headset paired with the bluetooth dongle immediately with no issues. Now when i initially played CS2 with them they were quieter than id like/expected, but thats when steelseries GG comes into play. After tinkering with Steelseries GG and tuning the audio to my liking, it really made this headset shine. the sound is exactly what i was looking for. I often hear more things than the average player on my team. If you know teamspeak and know the sound of that is very monotone and straight to the point this headset is quite similar. The sound is just very raw and isnt trying to make it sound like a jungle oasis. You hear what you have to hear and thats just pefect for counterstrike. Now this headset is also great for jungle oasis sounds, music sounds beautiful through them and so do videos/movies/shows etc. if you have been thinking about going wireless i really really recommend these... EVEN IF THEY ARENT ON SALE.

    My background: Saying I game a lot is an understatement. I probably spend about 30-40 hours a week on my pc both for work and gaming. In the last 10 years I've tried multiple headsets with different budgets ranging from $30-$150 until I settled with a budget Corsair headset for $40 for years.

I found myself removing the mic from other brands to get them out of the way, particularly while eating or something and then of course, having to remember where I put it and reattach when I wanted to chat.  Discord seems to be cooperating and not switching between multiple instances of the hardware (I am on wireless/lightspeed dongle, with the headphones plugged into a usb strip that is NOT connected to the computer)

    I had to get rid of my old head set and got this one to replace it. Overall this is a good headset, and I enjoy using it for gaming. Sound quality is good, nothing out of this world, but still good quality enough where I’d recommend it. One this I will warn is the volume scroller on the side sometimes gets messed with I lean back or lie down to watch a show, but this is a minor issue that shouldn’t typically be an issue. Also the cord length is not as long as I’d prefer, but it’s still a good length and again shouldn’t be an issue for most people. Mic works well, but it’s a bit finicky and sometimes when I play games and flip the mic up to mute it doesn’t actually mute in game. Does work in discord though. Headset is comfortable and the color (I got teal) is wonderful. It’s my favorite color and it looks the same as the pictures.TLDR: Good quality headphones, haven’t had any major issues with it, I’d recommend them if you’re thinking about getting these.

    This headset is great, the lightspeed transmission is better than bluetooth and has been very reliable.The audio quality is pretty fantastic, quite surprised me actually with how good it sounds especially compares to bluetooth headsets.The fit is comfortable and the battery life is decent, I get probably 20 hours out of them or more.The mic sounds pretty decent as well, pretty clear and not muffled or scratchy sounding.Overall a fantastic buy and I would definitely purchase again if these ever break.

    They are the most comfortable headset I have ever bought.  Very light with large ear pieces that fit around the ears not on them. Unlike some of my more expensive ones, these feel good after hours of wearing them!  The only drawback I have found, and it doesn't bother me at all, is you can hear sounds around you.

    I would say this is a really good headset for the price.Comfortable even with glasses.The fabric is nice on the ear cups. Never buying that fake leather crap that peals off and gets in my hair and all over the place.Mic boom is nice. Super handy to push it up and mute quickly. Good sound quality on the mic too.2 negatives I foundCord length is too short. Just needs another 2 feet.They say these are discord certified. But there are instances where I was playing a video that was playing through the headset and the mic was picking up the sound and playing it back. I have it on voice activity and automatic input sensitivity. The fix is either lowering the volume on what I am watching or turn off automatic input and set the db level my self but that sometimes does not work and I can get cut off because I talk with a low voice. Sometimes it stops doing this if I push the mic further away from my face.This is a five star headset but I am bringing it down to 4 only because they say this headset is discord certified but the mic playback tells me they don't certify nothing and it's just a paid partnership marketing scam. I really don't think they ""certify"" these headsets.Other then that the headset is great and I am enjoying it a lot. It's way more comfortable then my last headset. If you want a comparison to the HyperX Could wireless headset read below.When compared to the HyperX Cloud I, not the Cloud II. Both side by side have the same sound and mic quality. But Logitech headset wins on comfort. The Cloud headset lost it's durability on the band so the headset did not grip my head anymore and would slip off my head all the time.Ear cups on the HyperX would peel off and get everywhere. Logitech is fabric with nice memory foam. Much prefer logitech ear cups. Super comfy.The mic on the HyperX had no issues and really liked that mic. I would say HyperX mic is better only because the discord playback issue I have with logitech is sometimes annoying.HyperX wireless, I would say wireless headsets are worth. The fact that I can stand up and go to my kitchen while still talking and listening in discord is great.I do miss that about being wireless.With wired ones you have to set it down and stop the conversation to check on something.I would say get this headset but wireless.Best value LogitechBest quality HyperXBest comfort - LogitechBest durability - N/A still need to wear logitech for a little longer to find out.

    Very good for the price. The cord is just a tad short, it’s maybe 4-5 feet long. I almost never use the mic so I’m glad it lifts out of the way. Powered by a creative G6 sound card it sounds plenty loud with decent bass for most types of music. Once you adjust the ear cup height the comfort is great.

    My son's been gaming about 11 years now. We allowed headphones for high school and college work and for music listening. Ok - so all and I mean ALLLLL of the xbox headsets where complete trash. They broke easily and just hurt his head. he would wear a beanie to stand the pressure on the top of his head. Anyway, I went online here and physically tried 3 sets of headphones with swing mic, noise cancelling, padded head.Set 2 back b/c they were tight on the head or just felt terrible and mic use/mute was odd for gaming (so I'm told). IDK why I didn't jsut look for logitech (forgive me). My daughter loves hers b/c they are light weight and have the usb connector for her laptop. I had to find out if these with the 3.5mm jack would work well on his xbox one.  EUREKA!  Perfect fit - it displaces the weight of the headphones for a great feel over the head - no pinching, good noise cancelling, makes gaming great to hear!  Logitech is clearly the way to go with either the USB or 3.5mm jack connectors.

    My Logitech Pro X headset died. I didn't feel like spending $250 to replace it so, based on a review I read which listed them as the best ""Bang for the Buck"" option, I bought these. They're not great but... if affordable and function are your primary criteria I highly recommend this headset.

    As a gamming wireless headset Logitech does a good job. One gripe, the headband is at max and it's snuggly comfortable with no other expansion option. I have a big head, but the only adjustment is the inside top head strap which has 2 positions. Mine is at largest and like I said snuggly comfortable, I can live with it but a larger adjustment range would have been appreciated. Logitech usually does a super job, and I have no problem with their wireless mouse's, headset even keyboard. Other brands have been problematic. I drop the keyboard wireless for a wired mechanical gamming one but that was my choice. You usually can't go wrong with Logitech.

    I was looking for a phone holder stable enough to be able to use the phone while sitting in the holder. This is a descent holder.

    Excellent value!  I bought this for work. But after having it at home for a little while my wife really enjoyed using it. She uses it while she cooks to hold her phone off the countertop making it easier to see the video or read the recipe and keep her phone away from water. She uses it for reading etc…. I had to buy another one!  Now my daughter has her eye on it.

    I use this phone stand everyday.  I like it so much I bought one for my son-a-law last holiday.  I put it near the Bluetooth speaker when listening to music, use it next to the computer, and have my hands free to talk to family and friends while cooking or looking at a recipe!  I love the clean look…it has anti-slip pads on the phone contact areas, and easily adjusts.  If you do have to put it away (I never do) it easily folks almost flat.  Honestly, one of my best purchases and most used ever.

    I like Lamicall Stands but this stands is not as stabile or sturdy as the other four different Lamicall stands I  have purchased. This stand does not support my iPhone 12 Pro Max with a case on it. It is not stable / sturdyenough for my phone. It probably would work for smaller phones. This is a great company! It's just the wrongphone stand for the iPhone 12 Pro Max.

    I bought this as a gift for a cpa who works mostly in her home office. She works 10-12 hours a day from January to June and gets many calls and messages each day. My main concerns were if the stand was stable and able to hold the set position.Her feedback is that it is made tight enough to hold her setting and heavy enough to be stable. It has non-slip pads on one side of the reversible base which prevents sliding. Being collapsible makes it handy to take on out of town trips or during hurricane evacuations. She likes that, unlike before, she always knows where her device is and doesn't have to look for it on a busy desk. It's nice that she doesn't have to waste time and disrupt work by having to pick it up or crane her neck to see the importance of the interruption but can merely glance to see. Simple responses do not require removing the device from the stand. The stand cradle can hold her different  devices of differing thickness. She loves it and it makes me feel good that I gave something that is truly helpful.

    Gave it to my hubby and he gave me his old one that I thought was more sturdy. This one does not have a flat base. The round part of the hinge causes instability. The older type my husband gave me has a flat base with the round part of the hinge above the base not under.

    This is a great phone stand. I use it almost every day as my job takes me to multiple locations. It is very handy to be able to collapse it and put it in my bag and then get it out wherever I am and set it up beside my laptop. I can position it to do FaceTime interviews while I am filling out the paperwork on my laptop or see notifications come in while I’m in zoom meetings. I got this because I have two of the stands that do not collapse at home and wanted something that I could easily take with me when I left the house. This is one of the online purchases that I definitely do not regret at all. And I recommend this product to anyone looking for a phone stand that reads through the reviews. I hope you like it as much as I do.

    I bought this stand to go in my backpack, as I travel often for work. It's very sturdy. The tension on each of the joints is enough to hold any sized phone, and some smaller tablets (my 10"" tablet fit in it, as long as I don't tilt it over too much). But the tension is not so much you can't manipulate the pieces to get your desired position. When collapsed, it's about an inch thick.My only complaint is the shape of the two tabs that support the phone when it's in the stand. Their weird shape may prevent the stand from holding phones with thicker cases, or ones with built-in battery packs. I did not have that issue, but others may.Overall, the stand fits my needs. I've had it for a few months now, and have not detected any loss in joint tension. If it breaks, or I find something is wrong with it, I'll edit this post.

    This little thing is very sturdy and well designed for balance. I purchased the silver version and it looks very professional and clean. The build feels industrial but the look is organized. I have a large iPhone 11 Pro Max with a case and it easily holds my device. But I can also see why it could hold tablets. The weight retention is quite surprising here. I would recommend this to anyone that has a desk set up and wants a professional phone or tablet holder. Will buy again! This company knows what they’re doing.

You can eat your cereal and read. The triangular folds on iPad covers are fine, but this gadget lets you adjust for glare!  Love it!

    Bought a few of these for different rooms. My biggest want was to be able to charge my devices while in the stand via USB. Which is great. Lastly, they can easily be repositioned for more or less viewing angle or height. But, the stand retains the position well.

    I had a doughnut with a ridge to hold the cell phone,  but it took up too much space. This gismo works much better, and takes up less space. Well designed - probably by an engineer.

    I have purchased several of Lamicall's non-folding stands, and they are great. I wanted one to take with me on trips, but they are a bit awkward. I thought the folding one would be good, but it's about twice the weight. It's still a great stand, and I will keep it for when I'm not limited on weight and space.

    I like the fact that this Lamicall Adjustable Cell Phone Stand for Desk is strong enough to hold my iPhone 11 Pro Max without being afraid it will collapse under the phone's weight and size.  I have used a Lamicall stand for my iPad for years but had never before ordered a Lamicall phone stand until a couple of months ago.  I was always laying my phone down and couldn't readily find it, but by placing it on  the phone stand, it is easily seen from anywhere in the room.  Very pleased with this product.

    I like that they are so well made & sturdy, & requires some effort to adjust them the way you want them. What is not so good is that after using them for a few months they lose their sturdiness & don’t hold the adjustments very well. They seem to loosen up a bit with no way of making them sturdier again. My devices alter the adjustments too easily.

    I bought this to hold a cell phone, however its stable enough to also hold an iPad without any issues. The parts are made of metal and Lamicall's ""grey"" color is a perfect match for Apple's ""space grey"" color.  It folds up compactly if needed.  Overall, it's a wall crafted product and can hold either a phone or tablet.

    I struggle with airpods and squishy earbuds because they're too big for my ear canals. These have lots of fitting options and I have them in comfortably for hours. The sound is good for a wireless set. They of course won't have the deep bass of a real sound system but it works great for day to day in the office. They are not 100% noise canceling but it's enough I can't hear much. The price tag for such good sound can't be beat. They charge well and the case is very small. A tiny improvement would be if the case had a small bar so they can be attached to keyrings or hooked in a bag. For now they easily slip into a pocket or purse.

    The TOZO A1 Minis are a solid low profile pair of TWS earbuds. They just get the job done. Nothing particularly wrong with them nor spectacular which is fine. If I were to give a rating based on the price I got them at (about 15$ before sales tax) I'd give them 5 stars, but that may not be the case when you the consumer are browsing low budget options for wireless earbuds so I'm critiquing them at their roughly 30$ retail price.The sound quality is solid for the price. The mids are good enough, the bass feels a bit recessed, and the treble can sometimes seem sibilant depending on the song. These issues are further exacerbated the louder you crank up the volume. It's not that bad because there’s way worse sounding TWS buds in this price range, but it's just something worth mentioning. The other thing I'm a bit mixed on is the battery life, but it's another small compromise you have to deal with in this price bracket. It's good enough sort of like how I described the sound quality but I wish the actual listening time was in that 8 hour range alongside the case with maybe an addition 10 hours charge time. But these are a small low profile pair, and the case as well is tiny so it is what it is. 5.3 Bluetooth connectivity is nice though I'll say, have not had connection issues and you can sort of walk around your house with your phone down and not have the audio cut-out.Overall I may came off as a bit negative/dismissive, but I just wanted to give a realistic assessment. Like I said for about 15 bucks if you're able to get it for that price it's nearly a no brainer if your pockets are a bit tight right now. The compromises I mentioned earlier would be mostly negated at that shoestring budget price. Otherwise I'd spend another 15-25 dollars and go up a tier like with the Soundpeats Engine 4.

    I spend about two hours every night feeding community cats and I like to listen to videos or music while I'm feeding them. I lose my earbuds on a regular basis so I try to buy decent, no frills, inexpensive earbuds so losing them won't be a big deal. I had been maintaining two pairs of earbuds so I would have a pair to use while I was inevitably searching for the first pair that. After I managed to lose both pairs of earbuds I looked for good, inexpensive replacement earbuds. I've had a few Tozo earbuds in the past and I liked them so, when I found these Tozo earbuds priced at only about $20, I bought them.I use only one earbud at a time so I can hear things going on around me. That single earbud has to be loud enough for me to hear the program I'm listening to and the sound has to be clear. These are definitely no frills earbuds but they're loud and clear enough that I can hear my programming clearly even when there's a lot of traffic and other noise around. They're also small enough that they're not immediately visible. The light slate blue color helps too.I only miss one thing with these earbuds; they don't show the charge level of the individual earbuds when I put them in the case. The charge lasts a long time so I can live without knowing the earbuds' charge level. I've had these earbuds for just under a month and I've charged them 3 times, the initial charge when I first got them, a second time around two weeks after I got them, and a week or so later just to top them off.All in all, I'm very happy with these earbuds, although I might buy earbuds with an indicator showing the charge level of each earbud next time. I would recommend these earbuds if you're looking for inexpensive straight forward, no frills, good sounding earbuds.

    Not a fan of ""bud"" type headphones and would never consider buying a pair that would cost 100.00 or more, but I have to admit that the A1s are a great set of buds.  For phone calls are pod casts they're great.  Vocals are nice and clear and I've had no issues with the mics.  Clear calling all the way around.  For music, they are lacking in bass, put I've heard far worse.  The bass improves when I press in on them a little, and I found that by putting on the larger ear pieces greatly improved the bass and blocks out a good deal of outside noise.If you're looking for a nice set for a very good price, give the A1s a try.  You'll be surprised and pleased as long as you aren't expecting Bose or  Beats quality.I was impressed enough to upgrade to the T20s for the larger diaphragms.

    I don't understand! I bought a newer version of these ear buds just a couple days ago, yet when I came to review them it brought me into my old review of over a year ago? What's up with that Amazon? Anyway, as you can see below this paragraph is my year-ish ago review. These newer ear buds are far better then the older ones. They have great sound, easy to pair with all my devices (including my gaming PC), and the touch/tap commands are easy to follow - they don't always work, but they're easy to follow. For example, it comes with them set in a ""bell/beep"" type setting for indicating things like connecting, power low warning, etc. The instructions say to tap three times to get it to set to voice prompts (which I prefer, as the first time they ran down on power it was apparently sending me odd beep sounds. I paid the beeps no attention because I thought the beeps were coming from my game. I only figured it out after the buds shut off). So I tapped three times on the right bud - nothing, I tapped three times on the left - still nothing. I tapped 3 times again on the right and heard a beep. Since the instructions don't appear to say what the beeps mean, I have no idea if I was successful. Including even a brief mention of what the beeps mean would get nearly a five star review from me. As it is, I'll just have to wait and see if voice prompts are even possible with these. Just a suggestion, since the previous two types of these ear buds came with voice prompts already set, you might consider making these newer ones also come with voice prompts already set so you don't unnecessarily confuse and thus annoy your repeat customers. Over all, for the price (was on sale for around $15 U.S.) these are pretty good little buds - not the best for sure, but well worth even the normal $30ish they ask at the time of this review.OLD UPDATE: I finally found the brand I had been looking for and bought a second set. The quality is great and the battery life is about eight hours. Even so, this isn't about those ear buds, it's about these TOZO buds. Not long after I left my original review the company reached out to me and presented an offer to make up for my opinion of their ear buds. (My previous review below included only three stars, I would like to note that I know how this update might look considering what follows, but I assure you I am not bought, I speak my real mind in truth. That's just how I was raised. In any case, just read on and decide for yourselves.) They really like their product and wanted a second Chance to get a better opinion from me. Perhaps the pair of ear buds I originally got from them were just a bad set, I don't know. Anyway, they offered to replace the set I bought for free, also they offered a different set for free if I didn't want to try the first set again. I thanked them for the offer, but I found the original brand I'd been looking for (as noted below/above) and didn't need any more ear buds. However, about a week later they again reached out with the same offer adding that they really just wanted to make things right because they work hard to make sure all their customers are satisfied with their products. In truth, it seems their customer care services are very motivated, they do go out of their way to satisfy their customers. By my wife's suggestion I took them up on their offer for a different pair, the TOZO model T9. Instead of being small and hiding in the ear, these have a tail that resembles some Apple brand buds. Once I received them I charged them up and tried them out. They were much better than the first ones I bought, sound quality was very clear, I could even understand the voice in the buds telling me when they were connected. Most impressive though was the length of time the batteries appeared to last, I started using them about 12:30 p.m., and they finally ran out of juice at around 10:30 p.m. That was with non stop use! So I would like to add two things here. First, this company really prides itself on taking care of their customers. Second, I am especially glad my wife talked me into taking them up on their offer, because these second set of ear buds really met the great reviews that convinced me to try these in the first place.(Previous review:)I had bought a different pair for about the same price as these and was so impressed that I decided to buy a second pair. Since I couldn't find the ones I was looking for I decided to try these based on so many positive reviews. After receiving these, charged them up, set them up, used them for roughly four hours and the right ear bud ran out of power fallowed shortly by the left one. The other brand I used might have spoiled me a bit since they easily last a full eight hours before needing recharged. These also do not have the sound quality as my other pair even though they both were under $20. Finally, the announcer on this pair that tells you when you've hooked up to a Bluetooth connection, or when the ear buds need recharged is really hard for me to understand. Sorry but the accent is simply too distorted to make out clearly. I'll use these as an backup set for now, but I'm really going to look harder to find the brand I originally purchased since, for about the same price, they are far superior in every way.Your milage may be better than mine, but I won't be buying these again.

    I gave it four stars because I have not fully tested the product yet only been using it for a week now and I must say I'm impressed with the product for its price range.The earbuds are relatively small and fits my ears well and comes with five different size earbud tips to fit different size ears. It's very well packaged and with a fairly easy to read user manual ( words are a bit fine print), pairs very easily to my android phone and the sound quality is very good.I used both earbuds for an hour and forty minutes and they were still going.  The MFB touch panel is not as responsive as other more expensive ones I've used but it does well for its price level. I definitely would buy this product again

    UPDATE: My original review complained about the controls, which I found difficult to use initially. After several days, I've gotten better at tapping and holding, and am having greater success in controlling the output. In addition, I switched from Podcast Player to Pocket Casts (on a Samsung phone), and now I'm able to double-tap to go forwards and backwards in the same episode, which is what I really wanted. (I care much less about moving to the next/prior episode).  My only remaining complaint is that whatever I was last playing still starts automatically the second I remove the earbuds from their case. I now just single tap one of them to pause the playback, and then try to screw them into my ears without accidentally starting them up again (and that's hard).However, I feel that for $16, this is now definitely worth 5 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Let me start by saying that these are a good buy. For under $16, I wasn't expecting deluxe earbuds. The sound is fine for podcasts, which is what I listen to.What puzzles me is that everyone else is very happy with the controls, while I find them extremely difficult to use. I have them configured (via the Tozo app) so that one tap on either side should start or stop the podcast. Neither earbud reliably registers the tap every time. Double-tapping the right bud skips to the next episode, and that works OK most of the time. However, double-tapping the left bud, which should go to the previous episode, does not work at all (I've tried it from various places in my queue.). I had to disable triple-tapping on both sides--it's supposed to activate the Voice Assistant--because the buds didn't seem to distinguish between double- and triple-tapping.  Long pressing the buds to change the volume is finicky as well.  And there's no tapping option to skip ahead or go back in the same episode.After spending half an hour testing all the taps and experimenting with different configurations via the Tozo app to see if I could make the taps work better, I gave up, and decided just to use the phone's podcast app for all these functions.The other thing that's weird is that when I take the buds out of their case, they immediately begin to play the podcast that I listened to most recently, EVEN if I  exited the podcast and closed the podcast app (I use Podcast Player) on my phone.  And EVEN though the podcast app is configured to not allow external devices to start playing.  So by the time I get the earbuds out and screwed into my ears, I have to back up 30 seconds to catch what I just missed.So those are my kvetches. Having said all that, they're a good buy for the money. (I'll update this review if they don't last long). And I really appreciate the slick storage/charging case, and the fact that they came with multiple sizes of earbud tips.

    5 stars for the price.Ive gone through about 4 or 5 of these exact earbuds because I'm clumsy and lose them a lot. That's why I get the cheaper ones, i'd probably lose expensive ones. Also bought other models from this brand.My last pair lasted about 8 months before i lost them, and they were still running solid after using them several hours a day during that period.This new set is a little sketchy on pairing. Ive had to hit forget device on my iphone and re pair them up to my iphone a few times. Sound quality lasts solid. Very water proof, ive worn them in the shower. If you drop them straight into a pool of water, which i did several times with my last pair, the quality and max volume will go down but they still stayed strong through quite a bit; but that said if they're in your ears and it's raining they won't be damaged at all. Durability's 10/10 for me, that's why I keep buying them. Audio is solid; i haven't found a better pair at this price sound wise. It's got decent bass and doesn't have any tin sound like a lot of other cheap headphones.Only bad thing for me is that they're easy to lose and I'm stupid. I recommend periodically cleaning the metal that connects to the charging port, i use rubbing alcohol.

    I was having an issue with my right ear bud not charging. Which bummed me out because I love the quality of sound I get from these buds. After trying all that I could think of I reached out to customer service. They responded quickly and with helpful tips to try. On the second go round of messaging issue was resolved. Their instruction was easy to understand and follow and most important it worked! I love the fit of these, the sound and the battery life is great. When the time comes to purchase more, either for myself or as gifts, I will be returning right here. Thanks again to customer serivice for doing such a great job and for being so quick to address my issue. I have no doubt that had the issue not been fixed they would have made things right with me by either replacing them or refunding my money. It's nice to see a company still care about their customers and having pride in what they sell. Not a combination that one sees to often these days. You can't go wrong with product or company!

    First of all these are my second pair of Tozo ear buds. My last pair lasted many years until the battery gave out after heavy daily use. I was happy with them so I got a new pair from them. Let talk pros.THESE ARE TINY! I was shocked, I knew they were smaller than my old ones but they are almost comical how small they are.Battery life is good. These last easily the advertised 6 hours and from dead the case can charge the buds about 3ish times. Pretty goodUSB C at this price amazing. That's it that's the tweet.Now I'm sure you read the title so let'sntalk the cons and why I'm disappointedBattery life indicator. It does not want to disclose what it's remaining life is. It flashes quickly when putting a bud in and that's it you have to remove and replug the bud to check it. No other way to checkSound quality. These are NOT good as far as base. They are thin and all mids. That said it's not terrible for me as I listen to podcasts so not a deal breaker.The fit. My biggest disappointment. To be clear it's not the buds fault but they hurt my ears. I've tried wearing them several different ways with a few days break in between and several ear tips. They just plain hurt my ears. This is sad because I would tolerate the other cons if not for this.Overall these are great especially for the price. They are good build quality and they are good enough for most people. However I think if you are concerned about them hurting or like more than mids in your ear buds you may want to reconsider. If you need some earbuds you can toss around and won't be too sad if you lose or break them I say go for it. As for me I'm going to clean them and give them to someone as a gift.

    I am NOT a morning person. Neither is my boyfriend, but his 3 youngest children live with us full time and I am the one who gets up with them every day during the week. (We have all 5 of his kids Friday into Saturday and just the two oldest on Sundays, but Sundays I get up early to spend the day with the little boy I raised, for full context.) My ONLY day to sleep in, whatsoever, is Saturday. Given that the 5-year-old wakes up before the sun on school days, she isn’t any more patient on Saturdays and quite often wakes up everyone else in the house around 4:30/5am. We have FINALLY convinced her to just go sit alone in the living room so everyone else can sleep, but I always hear her (her dad sleeps like a log). Saturdays are the worst because it isn’t just one kid being noisy, it’s 5, plus the dog usually.Needless to say, I almost never get to sleep in. Whether it’s a school day, my Sunday responsibilities, or the kids coming in asking for a snack/a phone to play on (you have a million toys, PLAY WITH THEM!)/to get changed/or any other typical kid request, also god forbid the dog doesn’t get her medication on time or she has an accident because no one let her outside. These babies have saved me. I pop them in when I have my usual 3am wake up for water or the bathroom, turn on some brown noise on Spotify, and their dad has to take care of the morning routine.I can’t hear a THING. It’s great. All 5 of them came in this morning apparently, but I overslept my alarms by 30 minutes! I didn’t hear any whining or fighting, no one asked me for the breakfast I had set out for everyone (just in case their dad didn’t get up, I wanted a little tiny break). He had to field all of their dramas and questions and I just slept. I’m not even sure if these are marketed as noise-cancelling and, if nothing is playing, they aren’t as likely to drown out sounds as some other brands, but with subtle music on, I’m in a completely different world.Thank you for a product that allows me to sleep in at least once a week!BONUS: I can’t hear my boyfriend’s snoring over the music, either. 10/10 recommend.

    I have been using these now for a little over a week and after testing and having the time to fiddle with them I must say I am very pleased. They come packaged well and the ear buds have a protective barrier over the gold contacts that are used to charge in the charging case which I've never gotten with any head set I've owned (including beats) it made me feel vetter knowing that they didn't get damaged during transit especially given the issues I've had with similar cases and ear buds. The sound quality is superb and comparable to some of the higher priced products out there. Another HUGE plus is the number of ear bud choices and the different shapes. I have smaller ears and smaller ear canals and love that I could choose not only a different sized bud but a different shape. I wind up listening for 10+ hours a day alternating ear pieces as I work outside on residential properties and need to hear while on property and my ears don't hurt. Its the most comfortable head set I've ever owned. I can not recommend these enough. Price low and the quality and value is amazing. Don't miss out on these.

    I bought this along with another Bluetooth ear pieces. I read reviews that the sound and video don’t sync up and was going to return it, but I had gone over 30 days.I use this with my iPhone 11. Sound quality is good enough for me (compatible with the Apple wired earphones I have), it fits in my ear perfectly and for the price I paid, I can’t complain. I’ve used them for 2 weeks and haven’t had to charge the case so far (half hour to an hour use max each time I used them). According to my Chinese friends I’m tone deaf since I can’t distinguish between the different tones in Mandarin, so the quality of the sound may not be that high, but I don’t think I need anything high end.

    I was unsure which earbuds to purchase as I am new to this.  I've heard how great earbuds can be and I have heard bad things as well.  After researching a few different brands and reading a LOT of reviews, (positive and negative), I decided to purchase these.  The reviews were very positive on these earbuds and the company's description about them was very thorough.  I felt this was a brand I could trust as they stand behind their product, so I purchased the TOZO A1 Wireless earbuds.  When they arrived I read through the instructions, charged them fully and then turned on my Bluetooth to my phone then my laptop.  Both connected with ease.  I called my husband with them in and he said it was as if I was talking directly into my phone, he wouldn't have known is was wireless.  They have crystal clear sound.  I watched a movie on my laptop and heard everything clearly.  I would tell anyone not to hesitate as these earbuds are the way to go.  Especially for those like myself who have never used them. I had a few questions and in case you have the same I'm gonna tell ya.  Yes, you can listen to music, or any video, movies as well as use your phone through these little earbuds, they are super light weight, fit comfortably in the ear,. they are packaged in a nice little  box with a quick start guide and user manual, extra silicon earpieces and a charging cord.  The charging case (super compact), that they sit in has a strong magnetic hold (these babies aren't falling out) and charges up super fast and on the quick guide is a QR Code you can scan and get an additional 18 month warranty from the company.  Like I said before, ORDER THESE NOW, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THEM!!!!

    Ok so more detail.I like the price (got it on sale myself) I like the size etc, these things are actually really small and can get lost easy so be sure to get the correct ear tip size when you get them! Infact ive used these while my phone and the case was left in my room while I was in my bathroom brushing my teeth, I even cooked with these in. They have a pretty nice range and don’t seem to drop in quality of sound, I keep my volume at 40-50% these things can also get really loud.My only real dislike.. the ear tips can be difficult to put on! But these come with many sizes and they’re nice.Can’t say how long these may last but I take care of my stuff; will update this post when they break or anything and give when.March 23rd 2024

    So I got these little things a while back and paired them with my Apple Watch cellular. Now they pair with each other and the watch usually within about 7-8 seconds, without you doing anything except take them out of the case. The touch panel works okay. A firm tap should do it. Also I should mention that these come with a lot of different tips to use, but I like to use the small ones. By the way, the charger they come with is a short USB-C type, so if you want to charge them at any distance at all, you'll need a different cord. Not sure how much of a problem that would be since they're so light that I think it's fine to hang them from the cord.Overall:Pairing - 5 starsCharging - 4.5 starsSize - 4.5 stars since they are easily lost and have no tracking that I know of.Ease of use - 5 stars, since they do not fall out of my ears, pair automatically, and have a 4 light indicator that tells you how much the battery of the case has left. Not sure why it doesn't show you that when you open and close the lid or take them out or put them in but the pairing makes up for it.Also as far as I can tell they are not waterproof but I haven't gotten them wet yet.So in conclusion, they are a great little pair of earbuds that were definitely worth the price.

    I purchased these earbuds partly because of their enormous tally of positive reviews which persuaded me to take a chance- of course it's a low cost was the biggest incentive.  Recently I had purchased a pair of Samsung & beats earbuds for work, but had a stretch of bad luck and lost one earbud from each set. So I decided to give these a try until I could figure out what to do about perhaps buying another expensive pair in the future.  Being a huge fan of music, I like to consider myself an audiofile with a taste for very high quality sound for my music. Before I bought this set here on Amazon, I gave another site a try selling a (slightly) used pair of Bose quiet comfort first generation. The sound wasn't that great, and overrated my opinion. But I return them because I couldn't link the pods to my phone. I researched the problem and found other buyers had the same issue, I returned them in the in.  As far as cost, packaging, fit, pairing, operation, these TOZO earbuds are extremely difficult to beat in those regards and receive 10 out of 10 stars in my opinion. But sound quality, I wasn't expecting much and sadly I was right. With bass sounding nearly non-existent It's sound is similar to a 1960s transistor radio. Still, for the price is an excellent buy and a more than decent starter set or for the younger ones in your family.  I won't return these, but I'll keep them as a backup just in case whenever my other earpods need charging.

    I'm a walker, most of the time I wear bandless earmuffs. I purchased these so my earmuffs would go on properly. My other set of earbuds  have bands that go around my ear and I love those and use them at the gym.  My earmuffs don’t fit properly, and so I bought these. The sound  is clear. I have two issues with these, the first is that I can’t answer the phone and end a call as instructed so I use my phone. The other is that they are hard to remove from the case. I recently had my kids over and informed them of this so I wanted to be fair so we all tried to remove them from the case and two of the five of us had issues with removing them, the rest had no issue.

    I just got these so I can't do the battery life review. Also, since these were so inexpensive I bought TWO so 1 pair will always be charging.  I sold my house and moved into an apartment. So I don't want to turn the volume up on my TV or my computer. I do art tutorials all day or listen to Podcasts. I also like to have the doors and windows open for a fab breeze. I found I am sensitive to noise and get cranky hahahahaha. These ear buds I cant hear a darn thing out there! If there are any issues I will come back and advise but these things are awesome so far for the price.

    I needed a new pair of earbuds and chose this style which does fit well in my ear. I loved having a sage color so it stands out in my purse and on my desk. One weird thing is that I cannot connect both ear pieces at once, even though I have unpaired and reset a couple of times. So I did not give them 5 out of 5 stars and did not want the hassle of returning them. I do not care about noise cancellation, so the 3/5 rating is just because I didn't have an opinion about them.

    My air pods gave up on life and I can’t afford new ones for a while. These are pretty comfortable and come with 4 size options. Battery lasted at least 6 hours on and off. Sound quality is okay even at max volume. They come with a charging case and a short (4-6in) charging cable.They do NOT automatically disconnect when in their case. I have to disconnect in settings to use my phone or listen/watch without headphones. Not noise canceling (I don’t think it said they were but it’s kind of jarring if you’re going from AirPods to these).I’ve had them 2 weeks with no issuesIn a pinch I’d get them again and I’m happy with my purchase so far.

    These are actually really nice for the price. I have had several different ones and these are good. The sound is great, they turn on as soon as you take them out of the case, no having to click them multiple times the first time you use them. I synced them up without an issue. My only complaint is that they don’t stay in my ear as good as my last pair. I don’t like any of the other sizes it comes with. But they aren’t falling out too easily, so I can live with it.

    I picked these up because my old ones had a battery that only lasted about a year.  My wife used these and on her recommendation, I picked up a set for myself.  The noise canceling is very good, the audio quality excellent, and the battery life (depending on use) can be up to two days.  Overall I'm very happy with these, except that I'm used to tapping to raise or lower the volume.  Unless you have both in your ear, you have to use your device to raise or lower.  The only other issue I have is that you have to download the app to set what the various taps do.  Otherwise, very good product at a great price.

    I bought these because of the reviews of how comfortable they are with smaller ear canals. They stay in. I love that I can do my hair with them in and they don’t get in the way. I can lay down with them in and they are not uncomfortable. Most recently I washed and dried one of the headphones and didn’t realize until after it had gone through a full wash. I let it sit out for two days and then put it back in the charging case and it still works!!! If I lose them I will definitely get another pair. They are awesome.

    Sound quality is great and controls are easy to use! The app is great too because you can change some settings like EQ there. The downside is that the silicone ear pieces it comes with are very small. The largest one is probably closest to a size medium. They provide 5 sizes to try but they are all smaller than the default ones that come already attached. They are continually falling out of my ears while working at my desk job. I have not even tried to do any kind of exercise with them in.You can also tell from the pictures that there are clearly two different manufacturers of the silicone pieces they provide. The default ones are far right in the picture if that helps.

    So far so good, they seem to stay in my ears which is good because most earbuds don't, I just have wonky ear canals I suppose. I haven't used them while working out or walking yet so I don't have a comment on that, what I can say is that they synced up to my phone nicely and were a great price, I bought two because of that, I have no problem with the charging case, these seem to be a good, basic pair of wireless earbuds for someone like me, woman in her 50's, just looking to have some genX music playing here and there in life, I wouldn't know about bass or sound quality and don't really care, they do the job just fine.

    These are so worth the money. This is my second set, I lost the first ones and immediately bought a new pair they hold their charge. When I use them for talking on the phone, I never get any complaints about what the other people are hearing their comfortable my ears, a lot of things like the Apple headphones really hurt my ears, but These are so comfortable and their little case just fits in your front pocket. Excellent because with the curved design you forget it’s there.

    My 11 year old is good at losing things, especially small things. After replacing a several sets of AirPods because one turned up missing or the sound went out on one side, I said we can’t afford to be apple people at this rate. So I bought these and according to child, the noise cancelling is better than her AirPods. I’m still replacing them because they get lost , but have not had any of the quality issues from before and at this price you can have a few backup pairs around.

    I honestly like this brand especially these ear buds I have had to buy this exact kind when I lost mine I like how they are waterproof and the sound quality is nice but there was a few times where they would glitch but I think that’s because I would drop them by accident but this is the number one type of ear buds that I buy Every time that I would lose them these are really easy to get and for me the shipping was on time and it only took like two days to get to me

    I love these earbuds. I have bought multiple pairs (not because of the product not working, but because I accidently crushed one pair when lowering my car seat 🙃, although while the case no longer works for that pair, the earbuds themselves still stay strong as I charge them with my current case. You can use them individually or both at the same time with no problem. After a couple months, the magnet did start to have a problem and cane off when I opened the case. I put a small piece of tape to hold it in place and it works perfect. You can't any tell! (This is also probably because I am a little rough with them) I definitely regiment getting a pair. I also once lost one and just played a video really loud out of them and heard it from upstairs, I was very impressed.

    I liked these because they were inexpensive and I needed a pair of earbuds.They are worth the price. They charge fast, about 3 hours or so from dead to full.However they only hold a 3.5 hour playtime charge. Straight out of the box, first fully charge to empty, 1 earbud at a time. 3.5 hours. 1 year later. Still 3.5 hours playtime. That's lousy.Otherwise the sound is decent and the noise cancellation is decent. Not bad at all.Except for the playtime. I have to swap them out several times during an 8 hour shift.

    Overall, I am very happy with these earbuds. I liked the following points:-They provide great sound quality.-Call come through crystal clear.-Holds a charge well.-Love that I have color choices.-The “insert and twist” to fit in the ear takes some getting used to, but was not very difficult. It gave me a feeling of security that they wouldn’t be falling out of my ears.-Pairing with my phone was a breeze.-I still use my phone to pick up calls rather than touching the earbuds, but that’s just my preference.My only and biggest gripe is that I wish there was a way to adjust the bass down, as I listen to a lot of audio books and symphonic music, using more treble.Aside from that, I have purchased a set for my friend, and plan to purchase a couple more sets for gifts.Suggestion:It would be really nice if there was some sort of loop for a carabiner or key ring on the case. Or maybe link a compatible case cover? They are inexpensive enough to replace, but I would prefer not to misplace them if possible.

    I use Bluetooth on every device including the computer, I'm often communicating through programs like telegram and/or doing YouTube videos. I could not find a set of headphones Bluetooth that recorded audio while at the same time recording my voice, until this set. I have literally tried 8 different versions of different Bluetooth that claim they could do the same thing and none of them did, a lot of frustration and a lot of returns. This 1, I've only had it for a day, but already I've completed a 2 hour telegram conference call and have communicated on the phone and not a single person is made a single complaint nor have I had a single issue, so yes I would recommend it.

    These headphones have great sound quality for the price. They also come with a few different sizes for the pieces that go in your ear, so it's easy to find a size that works for you. I have seen plenty of headphones that only come with 3 sizes, including the ones that are already on the headphones, but these ones came with 5. I always struggle finding headphones that stay in my ears without creating a pocket of pressure behind them. My ears are very sensitive, so most headphones hurt my ears, but these ones are great.  I wouldn't say these are the best headphones I've ever had, but for the price, they are great.

    i did a lot of reading reviews on amazon before purchasing these and i have to agree with the majority: these are truly superior for such a low price. the app offers a lot of extra features. but they're also very simple.. one tap to play/stop, one tap to answer the phone. no problems at all with phone calls. they're small and fairly discreet.the price point was a big factor in choosing these and the sound quality and noise cancellation are truly better than more expensive ones. i'd give them 6 stars for exceeding expectation. tozo seems to be a really good brand.love being able to have both buds in and just get immersed in some good music. it's trippy if you have the right sort of lettuce to mix with it.

    I bought these to replace some Samsung galaxy earbuds. As fast as sound quality, they sound just as good.The shape of these actually fit my ear better than the galaxy, too, so they stay in much better.I accidentally senth them through the wash, so I left them in a zip lock bag of rice for a couple days and recharged them.

    I was skeptical about ordering an off brand two years ago. So I waited to write the review. So far, they’ve been easy to carry, clear, could be clearer but, good quality. It has a safety level as you turn them louder, to protect you. I have just now experienced one issue, a little static after a flight. Otherwise, they’re still good!

    I love the color, sound, and ease of use. The only reason I took a star off is that after about 20 minutes minutes my left ear hurts from the hard nub that rests at the opening of the ear. I've tried to change the little plastic attachments and nothing works. I have some that were on my corded earbuds and may try to put them on to see if that helps with my discomfort.

    Bought this as an addition to an expensive headphone so that I could use while exercising. The quality of the audio is clear and works well. Recently, the left and right headset started functioning in a way where I could connect the right to a different phone and left to another phone via Bluetooth…call it feature or bug..I leave it to you…but I could not connect both to one single phone.The reported the issue to the manufacturer and within 12 hrs, they provided a way to reset the Bluetooth and make both the left and right headset work simultaneously.

    I was impressed with the features of this product, the ability to move to the next song or pause the music with a simple tap or two of the buds.

If you want a good product without spending too much money, these are ideal.

    I have never been able to wear ear buds before because all them (until now) have just my ears after only a couple hours. With these I can put them in at 7 AM AND FORGET I am wearing them till 10 PM. I love being able to wear them inside my motorcycle helmet as well. I honestly forget they are in my ears. It took me two tries to find the best fitting silicone tips, they send plenty so it's easy to get a perfect fit.

    I use them 99% for listening to audio books. They are perfect for that. Fit well, look like they are constructed well, and voice audio on them is very clear.I tested on some music, and found the low end, maybe even the mid-low end pretty lacking. Would do in a pinch.For $20 though... that's makes these a deal!  If you want great sound for music, I don't think you can get that with even wired headphones that have no BT or battery!

    I wasn't expecting much at this price point, and with no EQ adjustment, the sound was very tinny. After upping the bass and lowering the 2k range - wow! Got about 5 hours of continuous use today (mostly music) before a recharge was needed. These are my 1st Bluetooth earbuds, so the only thing I can compare them to are the wired headphones and earbuds, many of which were ""studio monitor"" quality. These come very close and are a lot more comfortable to wear throughout the day. Will see how long they last!

    The ear buds are a slippery texture and paired with their smaller size makes them so hard to get out of the case (and I have small hands!)Battery life is great, and they do fit in my ears nicely and don’t fall out. Would recommend the larger size though, this “mini” size just isn’t worth the money.  I have the larger version and they are fantastic.

    So I've always had a pop socket on any phone case I've had for the grip. What I dislike about them is that the design always wears off after time, and once stuck to a case, they're impossible to ever remove. I got a new phone and had to purchase a new phone case. The case I bought said it was 'MagSafe compatible', so when it came to purchasing a pop socket for the new case, I got this one. I've never used the magnetic line before. I LOVE that I can remove my pop socket now at any time, and that I can actually use a car mount as well! My old pop sockets made it so I never could. I will definitely always be purchasing the magnetic pop sockets in the future- though I don't think I'll need to ever re-purchase because I can simply remove this one and put it on a different case!

    The PopSockets Phone Grip with Expanding Kickstand in Neon Pink is an absolute game-changer! Not only does it work great as a phone grip, providing a secure and comfortable hold, but the expanding kickstand is also incredibly convenient for hands-free viewing.I love the vibrant neon pink color, which adds a fun and stylish pop to my phone. It's a great way to personalize and accessorize my device while also adding functionality.The adhesive backing is strong and secure, ensuring that the PopSocket stays firmly in place on my phone. Plus, the collapsible design makes it easy to adjust and fold flat when not in use, so it doesn't add bulk to my phone when I'm not using it.Overall, I'm extremely impressed with the PopSockets Phone Grip with Expanding Kickstand. It works great, looks fantastic, and adds both style and functionality to my phone. Highly recommend!

    I’m a big fan of popsockets. But when I switched to a MagSafe case, I couldn’t use my old ones anymore. Then I found this product! A few bad reviews, but I think those ppl had the wrong case or something because this thing is AMAZING!! Strong hold. Sturdy. Exactly what I’d expect from this brand. I have an iPhone 15 max pro and it’s able to be picked up by just the popsocket and holds like a champ! Don’t believe the bad reviews. This thing is perfect. I have a Kate spade MagSafe and works like a dream.

    So far I have kind of a love/hate relationship with this Popsocket. I've been using regular adhesive Popsockets for many years, so when I finally got a MagSafe compatible case for my phone I was so excited to try the MagSafe Popsocket. So I'll start with the good things:1) Obviously, having the option to remove the Popsocket completely is top tier. I was able to wireless charge before (not with MagSafe) with the adhesive base on my old case, but removing the Pop grip entirely helps my phone connect easier. Also, it's just nice to have the option to take it off if I don't want it there for whatever reason, and I don't have to worry about adhesive ruining my case.2) Magnets are nice and strong so I'm not worried about it falling off. In fact, I struggle a bit to get it off sometimes.3) I got the warm lavender and the color is very pretty. I believe the top is swappable too, although I have a hard time twisting it off, I think because of the thick edges around it.Which brings me to the things I don't totally love...1) How big it is. I know this round design is a huge improvement from the ""pill"" shaped MagSafe grip (which I would never have bought lol), and I know it has to be a certain size to work with MagSafe anyway. I guess I'm just not used to it taking up so much space on the back of my case. For reference, I have the regular iPhone 12, so maybe you have one of those huge pop-tart phones it won't look so large.2) The border around the actual grip where the magnets are. Don't get me wrong, it's slim and fits against the phone nicely, but it feels weird to hold because there's less space for my fingers between the grip and the back of the phone now. Maybe I'm just too sensitive, idk.3) This is probably me being weird again but for some reason when my grip is closed down, whatever type of plastic it's made of makes a strange sticky/squeaky sound. I think because it's a different type of plastic than grips I've used before, since it's translucent. Now, some people might not notice this, or some people might even like it. As I said, I'm just a little weird, but the sound bothers me regardless and makes it seem kinda cheap. Which for a $30 phone grip.... yeah, not McLovin' it.So, long story short, I have no idea if I'm going to keep this. I guess I'll try it for another week or so and see how I feel about it. Not gonna lie, the few days I was Popsocket-free I liked how sleek my phone looked without one... until my butterfingers kept almost dropping it and I realized I desperately need some kind of grip. I don't want to go back to a regular Popsocket with the adhesive, so maybe I'll look elsewhere for a MagSafe-compatible grip that I don't have so many gripes with.Anyway, I can't believe I said this much about a Popsocket, but here we are. Talk about first world problems. Kudos to anyone who actually made it through this lol

    I was really sad when I upgraded my phone and bought a speck magnetic case. Realized after they charged me like $50 for the case(shouldn’t have gotten it thru the cell phone company. Lesson learned) that I couldn’t use my beloved pop socket and still use my magnet car mount. The socket kept the magnets from barely touchingThen I saw this and now I have the best of both worlds. I’ve only dropped my phone on my face about 5000 times since not having the pop socket. So I’m very glad to have it back and still be able to use my expensive case(🙄) and car mount!The magnet is strong but still easy to get off when you want it off. Very sturdy. Definitely recommend!

I love this popsocket. I was hesitant for a while to buy this, for I didn’t think that it was truly going to hold my phone and not fall off. I was wrong. This magsafe popsocket holds my phone amazing and has never fallen off, or (unless wanted)come off my phone case.  It is super easy to attach. It is easy to take off with some force. You are able to wireless charge. I did not use the magnetic circle that came with it. I have a phone case that already has one in it, but I’m sure either way the product would work the same. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a pop socket that is able to come on and off so that you are not restricted when it comes to using other products.

    For $10 I thought (a) the adhesion would come undone, or (b) the device would break. I pop it in/out many times a day, used on my Kindle while laying on my back. Ie, the full Kindle downward gravity against the pop socket. And I read many hours a day, so this has really stood the test. I fiddle with it sometimes, popping it in and out, rotating it, and it's never ""joint health"" so to speak. I'm pretty surprised.Ok, this being my first PopSocket, I don't know if they vary in terms of depth (how long it pops out) - but as a large man, it's pretty uncomfortable to sandwich between two fingers. It splays my fingers really wide, and I think it could be bad on the knuckles over time. I've switched to holding it skip-finger: ring and index, with middle resting on the top. That's the most comfortable, but I just feel if they gave it a tad more depth it wouldn't be necessary. Either way, I think mixing it up a bunch is your best bet besides, so you'll find something that works for you.

I have never had an issue.  I do have to take it off for the car mount because the popsocket brand does not work with iPhone 15, but that's okay because the grip pops on and off SO EASILY!

    This is a game changer! I am just now finding out that they make magnetic pop sockets!! I hated always having to take the case off to set it on my wireless charger on my bedside table at night to charge. Using the cord for charging, fine, but anytime to use a wireless the pop sockets that were adhered in place, were simply inconvenient. Also with car phone holders, I’d have to purchase one with a hole for the pop socket to fit in. Now I can just remove it, set it, and reattach when I’m ready! I can’t believe I haven’t already known this! Strongly recommend.Note- it stays in place well, strong hold for gentle to normal use! Now if you’re rough with your phone, or drop it, it will pop off if it’s a rough/strong hit. Otherwise, it’s fantastic!

    This is my first MagSafe Popsocket and I love it! Way nicer than the sticky adhesive ones, which I’ve been using for years though because I do love all Popsocket products. The magnetic one just feels like a really sleek upgrade. I have an older iPhone 11 and am using a special MagSafe compatible case on it. So I did not need to use the magnetic adapter ring that Popsocket offered in the package. Love love love the lavender color against my clear case and white phone! Will definitely continue to order Popsocket products in the future.

    At first, I couldn’t understand what the rave was about.  So I decided to buy one and I also bought a magnetic base and mounted it to the base for my MagSafe phone.  This way I could pop it off and put it on anytime I wanted and it did not interfere with placing my phone on the charger.  I have to say I really love it, and regret not purchasing one sooner.

    Nice but don’t like size I’m used to the regular popsocket if your a fan of those then u will feel the difference of grip/size between your fingers when u are holding it I kinda get cramped hands holding it I don’t think I will keep using it it is really nice color and style just the sizing for my small fingers aren’t too great better for people maybe with larger hands also the magnet works great n it’s nice it came with a sticker magnet which I didn’t know I could have just put on my old case instead of buying a new case

    I've used pop sockets for a few years now. Mine would have lasted longer, except I made the mistake of wearing my phone on a lanyard & caught it on a drawer handle when leaning over at work. Since I have a vinyl phone case, I have used super glue to make sure the socket is securely in place. Other than that, it sticks well with the adhesive already on it.

    LOVE this! I’ve recommended it to many people. Upgraded phones and the old adhesive ones that won’t work as I charge through my case. I pop this off at night and charge. So easy to remove. I also purchased the one that holds 3 cards so I can use it on a cruise without having to take my purse with me. Highly recommend these. They are worth the $!

    I love this MagSafe PopSocket!Got the opalescent color which looks perfect with my lilac phone case on my purple iPhone.Holding my phone can sometimes make my hand start to hurt. This popsocket provides a barrier between my hand and the phone.I tried to go popsocket-less for a while but my hand pain greatly increased. Big mistake!I combined this with the popsocket MagSafe car mount V2 and it’s perfect.Very happy!

    I wasn't sure if I would be happy with a magnetic pop socket. I have been a pop socket user for many years (need it for selfies) but had always used the sticky ones. This magnetic one is excellent! The magnet is very strong and sturdy and yet, when I need to remove it, I can. Very happy with this high quality purchase!

    Edit: I reached out to popsocket directly and they got back to me quickly with a code to use for a replacement. I love the metal but I will probably get an all plastic one because I have concerns about the metals longevity. Updating number of stars to 4 for the service and the overall functionality of the item.I love this and love the metal it makes it look a lot more elevated but the gold is tarnishing within a month of use. :( I guess I am going to return and get another version because I love the MagSafe tech and being able to take it on and off.

    I just switched from a regular phone case to a magsafe case, and wanted to still be able to use a phone grip. I was hesitant about a magnetic, $30 popsocket, but I totally get it now. The popsocket is magnetic, so you can just pull it off when you need to use your wireless charger. However, this magnet is STRONG! Like it’s not going to pop off unless you get your fingernails under the rim. You can hold your phone face down, 3 feet above the ground, hanging in by just the popsocket - and it will be SECURE. I also got the magnetic car mount to go with it, and I couldn’t be happier.

    I'm a long time PopSocket user; I love them.  But I wanted to be able to use a wireless charger with a MagSafe case.  I was skeptical this PopSocket would stay put but it's fantastically secure!  Takes some real effort to get it off at night for charging.  I still can swap out different PopSockets, same as I always did before.  I love this thing!

    This is my second time buying this brand and I love it! The pop socket is such great quality along with the adhesive they send!! I only got a new one because I got a new phone and the adhesive is almost the same price as a new one! These really do help hold your phone while texting, taking a picture and talking on the phone. Highly recommend

    A very easy to use low profile grip for your MagSafe compatible iPhone.  Can be used as a hand grip for your phone or a stand.  When bit needed it pops flat.  Very powerful magnetic grip won’t come off unintentionally, but can be removed easily when you want to charge wirelessly.

    I ordered this Magsafe Popsocket to match the new phone case also shown in the photo.All of my previous Popsockets were adhesive; this is one of my first Magsafe versions. I immediately noticed that the design has improved over the years. The rubber used in this one is much softer. Also, it fits much more comfortably in the hand, than the older, adhesive model. The magnetic grip is super strong, and the color matches the phone case perfectly!

    Hint...don't do what I did- I just had to check the magnet strength of the ring with the pop socket and they held together so strong that I couldn't separate them so I had to stick them on the phone together using the provided template. The magnets are very strong, I believe just  as strong as any Magsafe case. To use a flat charger you just snap it off temporarily. Highly recommend.

    It works, and holds on the grid-textured phone case. I should have got one of these a long time ago. It works great (if the grip has a slight ridge which is a bit annoying to hold long term).

    I picked this color because I wanted to see my case through it. I knew that it would not be entirely clear, but the ring around the magnet is WHITE. The pop socket is clear, and so is the rest of the base, but not the outer ring. Very weird looking on my dark case. Otherwise, I love it. I always use popsockets and I like the new circular MagSafe design.

    No more pinky sores or indents, with the increasing bulk of smartphones, a product like this is almost mandatory. It's a bit annoying taking it off to place it on chargers, but that's really just a physical limitation and not the fault of the product itself. If you're thinking about it, do it, especially if your pinky ever hurts from supporting your phone.

    I really like this pop socket- it’s cute and durable! However, the instructions say you can twist off the socket part and leave the base so you can reduce bulk/ change out the socket, but I can’t get it off. I’ve had others try it (others who have had pop sockets and have gotten them to work in the past) and no one can get it off. Not sure if it’s defective or not but not worth replacing

    I like the pop socket sm! I really just fidget with it on my phone. I got a Magsafe accessory to put it on so I don't have to commit to the sticky part on my phone. I would totally suggest that. The MagSafe popsocket was really expensive so I just bought them separately. Also, I play with the top piece so much that sometimes it falls off but I slide it back on. I don't know if that's because I'm doing something wrong or if it's just broken but I still like it.

    Love that it’s removable and you don’t get stuck with sticky Popsocket goo on your case. But it’s hard to get the Popsocket off for charging, even with fingernails. Trying to pull it off by pulling from the Popsocket itself only leads to the Popsocket popping out of its accordion base.The video demonstration on Popsocket’s website also did not distinguish that the magnet ring is an adapter and only needs to be applied if your phone case doesn’t have MagSafe. I made the foolish mistake of apply the extra magnet adapter to a MagSafe case and then putting the MagSafe Popsocket on. It was double magnet strength, which meant I needed to use a metal nail file to pop it off for charging my phone. In frustration, I debated ripping off the magnet and went back to Popsocket’s website to research a replacement ring, in case I did need it after all, and that’s when I learned that the ring is for converting a regular case to a MagSafe-ready case.Needless to say, it’s still hard to get this popsocket off even with removing the extra magnet adapter. Trade-off is that if the magnet was weaker, the Popsocket probably wouldn't stay on the case very well, so I’ll deal with it. Anything to avoid going back to using a regular Popsocket and traditional charging cord.

    This is a different version that the one I used to own. The pop out part is on the cap (push down and twist like medical pill bottle to release) and not at the base (pop out 4 holding grooves to release). This version technically has wireless charging compatible (more on this later). If you have a lot of the older version popsocket, know that the caps don’t work on the new version.Been using popsockets for at least half a decade now. Very functional with some minor inconveniences that I must work around, but overall worked well for me.What I love about is it that it provides better grip when holding the phone. Now if I use a phone without it in public, feels like anyone can snatch my phone off my hand at any second, or I’m afraid I may  accidently slip off my hand and drop the floorCan get better reach with fingers while still providing grip on the phone if you carry a larger phone.Also great as tabletop/kicks stand when I need it. Tend to use it all the time when watching steaming videos while eating or on casual video calls. No need to bring additional stand accessoryThere are some official accessories for it that I use, but also made some DIY ones. For example, if you have magnet attachment phone mount, you can disassemble the popsocket and put the metal plate inside with tape, and make it attach to magnetic surfaces (This only works with older version and not this one)This version can wirelessly charge if you attach it on your phone directly with no case. But the charging speed is not as fast than without popsocketAdhesive works well on all phones case surfaces I currently own. Heard from a co-worker that it didn’t work for them when they used it on items with waterproof surfacesIf you have accessories that holds the popsocket in place; I wouldn’t use the popsocket on them for at least 24 hours so it doesn’t peel itself off due to gravity during initial adhesion period.Extremely strong. Unless you intentionally use excessive force, it won’t fall off. Peeling the popsocket off can leave stains depending how long you had it on. With some cleaning tools can scrap it off without leaving much residue. Use hand sanitzer to take off the residue, better than using soup or just water.To take it off once it’s stuck on you must use fingernails (will not work if you have long nails) or a thin flat head screw driver around the circumferenceThey are durable. Aside from paint wearing off overtime, the first one I own still works like it did day 1. I’m not rough with my popsocket or phones so may want to take that under consideration (?)-Cons of the popsocket can be worked around.It adds thickness. As thick or slightly thicker than your phone without a case, making it 2x thicker at one location. If you wear tight pants/jeans, there will get a budge, especially if you put it in your back pocket.Seeing the bulge is not uniform can wobble when typing on phone on a flat surface.If you stick the popsocket on the phone directly, may interfere with some of its functionality such as wireless charging (if you have the older version). That’s why I always opt to put it on a case.Never happened to me, but my co-worker said it get snatched onto things when trying to pull it out of her purse. Maybe she has way too many stuff in there, or the fact that I always carry my phone in my pocket or dedicated pocket in my backpack.Overall, despite the negatives I find it very useful for daily tasks.

    I have a Samsung S23 Ultra with a non mag case on it. I bought this so I could convert over and use a charging mount in my car that is magnetic as well. This thing works well - almost too well it is a very strong magnet and I have broken finger nails trying to pry it off to use my magnetic car mount. Love the color and now I use a key or anything else but my nails to pry it off.

    The popsocket is just as pictured. Bright and full of sparkles. I’ve had it for a few months now and it’s holding up well with only minor scratches along the silver metal edge. No paint chipping or fading. The edges and tips of the wings take some getting used to because they can dig into your fingers if you’re not holding it properly but that aside it’s been just as I had hoped.

    Recently bought a magsafe case and was searching for magsafe accessories. I used to use pop sockets pretty regularly and had about 6, but I was not aware they had a magsafe version. This is so much better to me, easy removal and fairly sturdy.Only complaint is that your case might determine the strength. I have a casetify case and that’s what I’ve been using and the one in the photo, but I initially was confused how everyone was saying the magnet was so strong, it is sturdy enough but I do have to be a bit conscious that I don’t tug at it wrong, or when sliding in and out of pockets it may come off. This is not the case with my silicone apple case thought that is not one I use regularly. A little sad cause I wish the magnet was just as strong with this case but it isn’t necessarily pop sockets fault. It is just unfortunate. I will be keeping it cause regardless it helps me use my phone much more easily and makes it more comfortable to hold!.

    Great headphones for everyday use. I primarily use these to listen to music while walking around campus and doing homework and am very satisfied with these. They’re very comfortable and offer great sound quality including satisfying bass with the “Bass Up” thing turned on (but I’m no audiophile), easy-to-navigate and intuitive tactile buttons, good battery life and Bluetooth range, easy setup and quick connection to your devices, good noise cancelling in situations with low to medium amounts of noise, and a sleek look (I got the black ones). You can tell they’re not the highest quality material but that’s to be expected for a pair of headphones at this price point. These just need to be well taken care of to ensure they last as long as possible.I was originally looking for headphones to use both inside and out of the gym but I don’t think I’ll be using these in the gym. If anyone else is looking for gym headphones, I’d suggest spending more money on headphones that are more secure, durable, breathable, and IPX rated. I think these headphones excel (for their price) when used in typical everyday situations. These clearly aren’t designed for the gym and I wouldn’t recommend them for gym use either since they do have a little bit of slip (not enough to be noticeable when walking around but enough to where I’m sure it would get annoying in the gym), keep your ears pretty warm, are not rated for moisture/sweat, and are not particularly durable.Overall, I highly recommend these headphones for people just looking to listen to music while walking around or working. I’m happy about the comfort, sound quality, and long battery life.

The battery life seems like it lasts forever, they charge quickly, instantly connects when i turn them on and stays connected to my phone super well, sound canceling and audio quality is pretty good, and I can wear them for hours comfortably (even with my big head lol). Havent done much talking on them though so I can't speak to the mic quality, I assume it is pretty good too though because i haven't had any complaints on the 2-3 calls i have made with them on.Overall I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a good, basic set of headphones.

    I purchased these specifically for an upcoming multi-country, multi-flight trip and quite honestly didn't want to worry about locsing or damaging my existing set.  Mostly great reviews, great price point and checked all the boxes, or so I thought.Pros: Tested them at home and found I could wear them for hours without getting a headache. BT worked beautifully.  I could go outside, upstairs and into the basement without any problem.  Easily discovered by multiple devices.  I just have to remember to either disconnect or turn off Bluetooth when changing devices.  ANC did exactly what it claims- cut out ambient noise.  You can definitely tell the difference when it's on/off.  Voices were quieter but not silenced.  Battery life is great.  Talked with my daughter and heard her clearly.  She could easily hear me but she could tell I had a headset on.  Now, the not so good which I discovered on my current trip ...  Since planes aren't equipped with bluetooth, I plugged in the Aux cord to watch a movie. The ANC turned off.  The noise difference is obvious!  Never considered that because that's not the case with my other headsets.  My daughter suggested adding a Bluetooth transmitter which I'll be doing before my next flight.  Hopefully it'll do the trick.

    After a frustrating trial-and-error experience with four other headphone pairs within the same price range, I stumbled upon these gems thanks to a recommendation from an obscure audiophile blog. Let me tell you, I am absolutely thrilled that I did!My daily routine includes hitting the gym 3-4 times a week and  an 8hr work day, during which these headphones become an integral part of my day. Comfort was a priority for me, given the amount of time I spend wearing them, and I'm delighted to report that the cushions feel like little clouds enveloping my ears – light, airy, and incredibly comfortable. They do an excellent job of maintaining sound quality while keeping unwanted noise out.After nearly a year of continuous use, I did notice some minor peeling on the cushions around the 11-month mark. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that replacement cushions are both affordable and just as comfortable as the originals.The battery life of these headphones is nothing short of extraordinary. Even after a year of heavy use, I am still amazed at how infrequently I need to charge them. While I can't claim to be an audiophile, I thoroughly enjoy the sound quality and bass these headphones deliver. They can get quite loud, and considering their price point, they do an admirable job of blocking out external noise.Overall, I have been thoroughly satisfied with this purchase. Despite my positive experience, I hadn't felt compelled to leave a review until now. That changed recently when, on the one-year anniversary of my purchase, I accidentally dropped them into a creek during a jog at the park. They made a funny noise and wouldn't power on/off so I thought it was toast. After allowing them to dry for a few days, it powered on and is working just as flawlessly as before. Beyond impressed with their durability and performance 10/10 would def buy again!

    I've had the Soundcore Q20 headphones for almost a month now, and I thought I'd start off my review with one simple statement: I've only charged these things ONCE since I've taken them out of the box. These headphones have absolutely phenomenal battery life. The only reason I charged them was because I wanted to test how long they would last on a full charge (within my day to day use). I received these headphones on the 1st of April. It is currently the 27th of April and the battery is still at ""Medium"" (there is no visual indicator, however there is a voice that tells you whether your battery is ""High"", ""Medium"", or ""Low"").That being said, I'll go ahead and list some Pros:- Battery Life (Seriously, I can't stress enough how good it is)- Sound Quality- Comfort- Looks- Sturdiness/Build Quality- Noise Cancellation (there's a caveat here, continue reading to see what I mean)BATTERY LIFE:As if I haven't already said enough, these headphones refuse to die. I've used them from anywhere between an hour to 3-4 hours at a time (long gaming sessions or binging a show on my laptop or phone), and they just don't let up. Like I mentioned in the intro, it's been almost an entire month with these headphones and I've only had to charge them once. It is worth mentioning that the battery will drain much faster with noise-cancelling turned on, as it is indeed ACTIVE noise-cancelling and uses more power. I've got to give props to Anker for marketing these as lasting 40 hours, as this runtime is more accurate when noise-cancelling is ON. With ANC off, these can easily last 60+ hours. It's always refreshing to see a company slightly under-sell and over-deliver.SOUND QUALITY:These things sound way better than they should at this price-point. I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, but I do have experience with over-ear, closed-back studio headphones (I own a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50x's), and dabble in amateur sound mixing/mastering as a guitarist. Apart from being just a bit heavier on the bass than I would like, these headphones do an excellent job at bringing out lows, mids, and highs in pretty much anything you'll find yourself listening to. Nothing sounds drowned out or overexposed (with the exception of the bass, but there's a valid reason for it in this case). I bought these headphones primarily for multimedia consumption (movies, video games, music, etc.). They have just the right amount of punch in the low-end to make things such as explosions or bass-heavy sound effects really shine. In this instance, the heavier low-end makes sense. Voices sound crystal clear, as the mids don't get drowned out by the lows or highs like on some other higher-priced headphones (looking at you, Beats..). The highs are where these things truly shine, in my opinion. Lots of budget headphones tend to sound very ""tinny"" with harsh, sharp highs to over-compensate for the overly-saturated bass, but these do a great job at keeping both the mids and highs prominent enough (despite the thicker bass).COMFORT:I've owned and used plenty of both over-ear and on-ear headphones over the years, and I can't beat around the bush here: these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. I was expecting to have to ""break them in"", given what some of the other reviews were saying, but the minute I put these on I was pleasantly surprised at just how soft and light these felt (without feeling cheap or flimsy). And I wear glasses!LOOKS:Not a whole lot to say about how these look. I wouldn't say you'll be turning heads while wearing these out and about, but for the amount of money that they cost.. I'm just saying they could've looked a lot worse. I've seen headphones three times the price that are a complete eye-sore. The Q20s are clean and minimalistic, without giving away its low price.STURDINESS/BUILD QUALITY:Although I'm not one to man-handle my devices (no matter how little they may cost), I have to say that these don't feel the least bit flimsy. I did a mild stress-test by stretching both ear cups apart as far as I was comfortable with and was able to get about 10 inches wide. I don't think anyone has a head that wide, but if you do, these are definitely going to fit. The build quality feels great, and I feel like these will definitely last a while (and I will be updating this review if that changes lol).NOISE CANCELLATION:These headphones do indeed have active noise cancelling, BUT.. I literally almost NEVER use it. Here's why: they don't need it. The headphones are built in such a way that even with the ANC off, they drown out a ton of outside noise. Unfortunately, there is a significant drop in volume when noise-cancelling is activated. The bass takes a hit as well, making it more evened out with the mids and highs (which might be a plus for some).FINAL THOUGHTS:There's only really one ""Con"" that I wasn't going to mention, and that's the carrying bag that comes with the Q20s. There's nothing really wrong with it, but I did just want to note that they used to come with a hard carrying case (according to some older YouTube reviews), and I'm a little salty that us newer buyers don't get that lol. All in all, for the $60 that I paid for these headphones, I can't think of any reason not to fully recommend them. They sound great, the battery life lasts incredibly long (almost to a suspicious degree, making you feel like today is finally the day it'll need a charge only to be proven wrong), it's got decent looks, solid build, and they even threw in Active Noise Cancellation for situations that call for some extra silence. If you're in the market for some new headphones for multimedia consumption (I definitely would not use these for any professional work, as they are not made for that), and have a bit of a stiffer budget, look no further. These will do more than its price tag leads on.

    Sound quality is better than another one I returned (for which I paid double the price of this one).  Buttons for volume/phone answer/forward-rewind  and on/off + noise cancel are placed on opposite ear pads and nicely tactile for easy function.  Voice quality on a phone call (with built-in mike) was actually better than a 299 dollar Bose I bought and returned to Costco because of the poor noise cancellation in wind and poor voice quality on phone calls.  Very pleased.

    Update Dec 2023- These headphones are still as awesome as the day I received them in 2019!  Ankar is truly hard to beat.  Just in case you’re looking for a pair I can vouch for the quality of these.I’ve had these headphones since end of December 2019, gotten for flight over the holidays. Tried out both Bose noice Cancelling headphones at local brick & mortar store, but the price caused me to pause.  On to Amazon where I found these, better price, would arrive before my flight, sounded like a deal worth a shot after reading everything about them what did I have to lose with Amazon’s return policy & Anker’s reputation for quality.I’ve had great chargers, other electronic items by Anker with great results.  They arrived on time well packaged, impressive from the start, but sound quality sealed the deal.Back to Anker headphones, I love them! The sound quality is amazing, when I have ANC on I can’t hear anything but music, the outside noise is indeed cancelled. Even on my really bad flight (another story) a guy wanted to test them against his B newest headphones, so we switched for a test. He said he wish he had known about Ankers quality & price, they were impressive not that he would give up the B set, but would definitely buy them as a spare or an extra pair to use for other activities, he couldn’t believe the price.  He went straight to Amazon asked me if the pair he chose were the same as mine, they were & he ordered them. That kind of confirmed I have a great pair of anc headphones & didn’t pay $$$ for them,They pair easily and are comfortable - until I’ve worn for hours then my shades/glasses are indented in my skull, time for a break, but that’s after hours of wearing-enjoying great sounding music 4-6 hrs & battery is still strong, time fly by.There are only 2 minor suggestions for Anker regarding these headphones 1) add to Soundcore app please (after thought I don’t know if it’s needed unless to customize equalizer) the volume can be controlled on the headphones.  2) the headband could use a slight redesign.  Wearing them while working out, doing lawn work or inside cleaning, cooking, always moving about  (excellent BT range btw), the top of headband pulls my hair as the headband is adjustable it tends to slide a wee bit & my hair gets pulled  so I have to adjust them & keep going, I’ve no idea how they could do this it’s something I noticed when trying out my son's. He bought a cheap pair of JBL headphones for lawn mowing, they do fit a little better but don’t compare to Ankers sound quality, imho Would love JBL type fit on Anker Life Q20 hybrid ANC headphones!Taking phone calls while wearing headphones works great, I asked how did I sound, fine he said, then we laughed when I told him I was listening to music on my Ankers when he called & I took the call while wearing my headphones. Neither of us had any problems with quality of call. Volume is easy to find & adjust the multifunction button is easy to use for music or calls.They come with the charging cable, though I wish more companies included the wall plug in,I don’t always have a spare just ling around, ok so I never have a spare just laying about.  Also the aux cable is included though I haven’t used that feature yet. A drawstring pouch to put them in, which was good as I didn’t have a case to put them in for my flight & no time to get one. Instructions are well written Anker products are always first classLove these headphones, the ANC & overall sound quality at this price point is a gift that keeps on giving. The quality of this model looks & sounds like the much higher price headphones, maybe better than some.  I wouldn’t hesitate to buy for a gift as they come gift wrap ready or a gift of music for me.Overall Ankers entry into the headphone, earbud market is welcomed. I wouldn’t hesitate to try them out if you’re looking for headphones with ANC Fantastic sound, that doesn’t break the budget to tears, give them a listen I think you’re going to love them.Simply put my Anker Life Q20 ANC headphones are fantastic in quality and sound. I’m not an audiophile but I can’t find a thing disappointing in these, not quality or sound.  I like a variety of music & I hear good  bass, mid tones & treble, vocal it’s all there. As said for everything including quality these headphones deliver at a price that doesn’t break the bank & with Ankers outstanding customer service is amazing. I can honestly say Anker SoundCore is definitely impressive, just as their charging cables, & other electronic devices that was my first introduction to Anker products. I’m sure I’ll look at their Bluetooth speakers soon.Sorry for overly long review, there’s so many outstanding elements that I feel are important for customers to know when spending your money,I try to offer as much info I’ve experienced as possible, I’ve relied on Amazon customer reviews when making a purchase, they’re brutally honest good or bad & I appreciate that.I’ve had & used these headphones since late 22nd December, tonight is 25 July enough time to really evaluate  them, they’ve exceeded my expectations, I would definitely recommend, most of all I would buy them again.Thanks if you did read this long review, good intentions to help others as they shop. UPDATE 12 August a friend of mine used my Ankers while visiting. He called back he had received his very own Anker Life Q 20 headphones.  That says a lot about the sound & quality whilst respecting the customers wallet, he was so happy with his new headphones & that I recommended Ankers.Thanks again to Amazon shoppers, Amazon & AnkerUPDATE:  if you’ve read my review you know I’ve had this set of headphones since Dec 2019 it’s Nov 29 2023. I  thought I would need to replace them this week but not so fast! Removed them from the pouch they came with, paired with new iPhone and wore them while preparing dinner continuing until bedtime always after midnight.  The quality of sound, the hours of comfort while carrying on with everything needed to be done, the joy of listening to many genres of music was fantastic even taking a call.In 2019 I think there was 1 color choice, sure I’d loved to have had the choices Anker has today but I didn’t buy them as a fashion statement but for the Anker quality, outstanding customer service in every product they put the Anker name on.  These headphones have not diminished in sound quality whether I’m jamming as I go through daily chores, or taking or making phone calls while wearing this same pair of headphones.In this current economic environment I’m thrilled for Anker’s dedication to quality while delivering headphones that are affordable. And providing a fantastic choiceI wanted Amazon shoppers to know they have a choice if shopping for headphones that doesn’t sacrifice sound or quality or lasting performance.  When I’m looking for another set of headphones or the Anker Liberty Air EarPods or the many chargers I’ve bought, I always look for Anker/Soundcore first I know the quality and their outstanding customer supportThanks everyone Happy Shopping

    Overall they are a decent head phone not wow like bose or higher quality but they do the trick for a cheap pair of head phones. They’ll work until the holiday sales start.Pro’sBluetooth or aux cord. Most devices are going away from aux cord but they know a lot of people have older devices and can not financially update and this allows both.Decent sound for a cheapo pair of head phones. I wouldn’t rave it great but it gets the job done. I compared them to my older head phones from 10 yrs ago and was a bit impressed but def NOT  wow they’re great. No where near bose but it does the job. It does some sounds decently but is not so great at other sounds. If you like surround sound I would not rate these great for that. I love good sounding music and these don’t cut it for me but will do until the holiday sales kick in. I live in my head phones so I will get high quality ones these ain't it.Won’t break the bank. For a cheap head phone these are actually pretty decent. I’ve had my fair share of cheap not so great head phones. If you are not hard on your head phones you could easily get a couple yrs out of these. I have a lot of aux cord devices and this will probably end up being a back up pair for those. In the long run I may eventually take out the battery and keep them as a aux cord headphone.Great noise cancelation up to about 90 dec. That's pretty much most back ground noise. Works great as I'm a light sleeper. This is a standard feature with most head phones these days.Con’sShort battery life. I mean 40 hrs isn’t that long. I know other head phones that can last up to 3 days with a full charge. I mean that’s every other day you’re charging them for 2 hrs.Short axu cord. Sorry but 1.5 ft is very short and you need at least a 3 ft cord to be comfortable with it. You can easily buy a longer aux cord on amazon if this one be too short for you. Yes the aux cord can affect the sound quality. You be best to buy a more decent one than the cheapo one that came in the box.Charging cord is very short 0.5ft. Designed to charge device off to the side not while using it. I am glad I bought a universal head charger as this won’t cut it for me. Am I the only one who finds the tedious charging of head phones annoying?Environment affects battery life. This head phone is designed for the ideal temps of 40-90f.  Anything outside of this range can heavily affect them. If you read the manual this is in there.Volume controls are a bit difficult to access. You have to tuck under the ear piece and feel for them instead of blindly taping the ear piece for it. This is a bit frustrating.Not the best sound. Great for a chep pair but I wouldn’t go raving about the sound quality. I am use to high quality sound such as bose or better.Can’t hear anything in a noisy environment above 90 decimals unless the volume is over 30%. Sorry but my old beats could easily blast through that and I could hear my beats as low as 5% volume in noisy environments. I had a fan running in the back ground and had to have them 40% or higher to hear them.App that comes with the head phones will steal the data on your phone. So many people fall for this and you can run the device fine without it. Please read the i agree clause and you will save your self from this fate. You do NOT need the app and they work just fine as a stand alone device.Unable to disable the voice notifications. I use my head phones a lot and find it annoying when your device randomly says “battery low” or gives an odd command out of the blue. Zero way to disable this.A bit tight for me. These are pretty tight on my head and I do not find them the slightest bit comfortable. The ear pieces are huge for me and it would be nice to have them a couple inches smaller.

    They're perfect for what I'm using them for-- but definitely read first before buying, because the upgraded version may be what you're looking for.I am incredibly sensitive to headphones (as opposed to earbuds). My head is really sensitive to pressure, and even with light headsets I can start getting a migraine with constant pressure in one spot for too long. My ears also experience the same sensitivity-- they go numb/get tingly pain very easily with on-ear sets.I've been using my Airpod Pros as my go-tos for three years now, but I wanted over-ears for when I'm playing my keyboard piano-- it just gives a better atmospheric sound and nuance, in my opinion. So because of this, it was really important to me to get a pair that could be wired, on top of being bluetooth for versatility. I also prefer a wire option for AIRPLANES! If you ever want to watch an in-flight movie, you still need an aux cable these days. Surprisingly, it was difficult to find a model of headphones that still offer both options. It was a big reason I went with these.CHARGING/BATTERY:The first con is that these use micro USB to charge. Most updated tech is moving to USB-C, and I don't have any other devices that still use micro cables. When I travel with these, I need to remember to bring that designated cord. (Note, the Q20i model has USBC charging) On the other hand, the impressive battery life (60H with ANC off, 40 with it on) does help with that. I also like that it tells you verbally the battery level when you turn them on, so you get a heads up of what the charge is at. However, my apple devices also give me a battery percentage indicator for more accurate levels.EAR CUPS/NOISE CANCELLATION:The over-ear design is so much more comfortable than on-ear, and even helps enhance the active noise cancellation. A lot of external sound is filtered out even with ANC off because of how these cup around your ears snugly (but not too tightly!). My ears fit all the way inside comfortably. As I type this, I have cleaners in my home running a vacuum downstairs and I didn't even notice until I took the headphones off.COMFORT:When I first opened these up and put them on, I felt that the cups were putting slight pressure inward against my head, but after wearing them for ~5hr they seem to have already ""broken in"" and it's not noticeable anymore. As far as the top of the headset, I will say there's not a ton of cushion, but it's enough for these to feel okay for hours on my sensitive head.SIZING:They're not that heavy but they do press down a bit on my head because they're SLIGHTLY large on my head. I'm a 5'4"" woman, I'd say pretty average sized head?? lol - but these do feel a bit big on me. I don't think I would use them for working out or running, something as small as even just looking downward is enough to have them slightly slip. In general I do prefer working out with earbuds anyway just due to sweat, so that's not what I really bought these for anyway but thought I'd mention for any other petite women. Because of this, these are for sure going to be more for piano / computer / travel.BASS/SOUND:I feel like there was mixed reviews about the bass capabilities. Even with the BassUp feature off, I feel like the bass is great on these without distorting! I listen to Billie Eilish a lot, who is known for very bass-heavy music. Without BassUp, her songs sound well balanced (while still obviously bass-heavy). With BassUp on, you get that fuzzy feeling in your ears when the bass kicks in (but still no distortion). Speaking of Billie, she also utilizes stereo sound a lot (some sounds in left ear, some sounds in right) and it sounds great in these. Note that there is no transparency mode on these, but the Q20i model has that if it's a must for you.CONNECTIVITY:This was a big one for me, and probably the reason I am going to be returning these for the upgraded Q20i. I've been spoiled by my Airpods in terms of being able to switch between devices seamlessly (ipad/iphone/imac) without having to disconnect one device and re-pair the other. With this set, I have to go into my iPhone settings, disconnect, then pair with my computer and vice versa whenever I want to switch. It's a small annoyance but a convenience I really prefer.PRICE:I bought these on sale for $39.99 and I feel like that's a super fair price for the quality and buying from a reputable brand like Anker. I have several of their items, and they have great customer service. I'd much rather spend the extra $10-20 from the super off brands here on Amazon, just for the peace of mind that they stand by their products.

    UPDATE: Added the 5th star.  Read the review with edits at the end.Wow.  I am rarely this blown away by consumer-grade peripherals, but I feel very compelled to write a glowing review of these headphones.I do a lot of audio work, and cans are ubiquitous.  I have some wired Sennies that I love behind the mixer, a couple wired Audio Technicas that have stood the test of time in the broadcast studio, and a pair of nice Sony BT cans with ANC, so I will be comparing these Ankers to the Sony model WH-1000MX3.Without question, Anker has come further, faster, than a lot of peripheral manufacturers.  The attention to detail in their products is exceptional, and downright attractive.  The build quality is great, the packaging is great, the functionality is great, the ergonomics are great.  My experience with their hubs is what leaned me toward their headphones.After a bad experience with in-ear phones on an airplane, I decided I really needed some over-the-ear headphones for flying, but I didn't want to carry around a $300 pair of cans that I only use a couple dozen times a year.  I looked on Amazon, saw the reviews, read the single-star complaints, and plunked down a whopping $60 (SIXTY BUCKS?!?!  Are you kidding?) figuring they couldn't sound that awful and would be perfect for the task.Let me assure you: these are the perfect headphones for flying.I like the idea that if they get lost or stolen, they're easily replaceable.  I love how well they fit (with a caveat, below), and they look great.  MOST of all, holy cow do they sound great!Pairing the first time was a little bit of a process, but that's to be expected the first time you play with a new toy.  After that, I put on my go-to sound check song (""Sacrilege,"" by Mentallo and the Fixer), cranked the volume way up, and listened.I have no idea what the THD or frequency range on these are, but I don't think I care.  The ""silent note"" at the 1:00 mark of that song came through so clearly, without even the slightest hiss or noise, that I was madly in love with them immediately.  The dynamic range is exceptional, there was no need for me to play with the super-duper-bass-button-doodad, I just let it play.The highs are crisp without tinny tones, the lows are deep without rattling the 40mm drivers (I'd love a set like this with 50mm drivers), just a very clean, direct, simple, uncomplicated sound quality that rivals the AT 500's I have and is absolutely on-par with the Sonys.So I tested the ANR.  I turned on the A/C in my office, reset Sacrilege, and played the beginning again.  The A/C, as expected, kinda dampened the experience, but not any worse than the Sonys.  I reset the song again, with the A/C on, and activated ANR (it's called ANC on the Sonys).  THIS is where the two headphones differ dramatically.With Noise Cancellation on, the Ankers outperform the Sonys.  Period.  It's a night and day difference, so if this is why you're considering these headphones, waste no more time and go get yourself a pair.In terms of tonal quality, I put these at the top of the list of any wireless earphones anywhere.  I mean it.  They're better than ANY earbud type I've listened with, they're better than every other OTE without ANR/ANC, and they're as good as the Sonys, but with better ANR.  They're better than any WIRED earbud, too, including the Sony IEMs I used to use back when everything had an 1/8"" jack.Sound is, as you would expect, not 'quite' as good as the higher-end wired ATs and Sennies.  I don't think Anker would mind me saying that, because they're a completely different application.  If you play MP3s and don't think they sound worse than lossless files, you wouldn't appreciate the higher-end phones, so go buy these right away.  If you can't hear compression noise in your satellite radio, then you won't appreciate the compression of BlueTooth and you should go buy these right away.That's quite a lot of good stuff to say about a pair of headphones that cost less than a decent dinner.There are 3 reasons for the 4 star review.1.  The ear pads are uncomfortable for my ears.  Not VERY uncomfortable, but enough that I have to adjust the phones several times during a 3 hour flight.  It might be that they're new and I just need to break them in.  If that turns out to be true, I'll adjust the review up a star.2.  The battery life isn't that great.  To be fair, I only need about 12 hours of battery life and I'll just recharge them.  However, the advertised battery life is estimated at 40 hours with ANR and 60 hours without.  My experience is that with ANR I get about 22-24 hours, and without I get about 48.  Now, I have not had these very long, so I've only timed my first recharges, so if it turns out the battery life goes up with proper use, I'll add the 5th star.3.  They don't fold up as small as the Sonys or even my ATs.  This one alone is not worth docking a whole star, but it's the only other complaint I have.  Carry-on space is so limited, and there's a pocket in my bag that the Sonys fit in, and these don't (not by much though).Hope that helps you make a decision.  I'm very happy with these, and I just might give them some airtime at sea level just for giggles.UPDATE January 2023: After using these headphones for a reasonable amount of time, I'm adding the 5th star.  The earphone cushions did ""break in,"" which I'm not crazy about (if it breaks in, it will break out), but they did become more comfortable.  Ordinary movement is sufficient to avoid the urge to move the head phones.  On a 3 hour flight, they're perfectly fine.  When they are new, the cushions are a bit stiff and I should have realized that, because my AT's needed their cushions replaced after umpteen years.Battery-wise, I am getting pretty close to advertised spec, but I have noticed that if you crank up the volume on your phone or player, then crank up the volume on the headphones, the battery life suffers dramatically.  Play with it a bit, adjusting device volume and then headphone volume until you get good sound without noise.Finally, I'll tell you that I like these so much that I bought a BT card for my PC.  These are pretty good for videoconferences, and they're nice to have while you run a buzzsaw or have screaming children next door and you just want to not be distracted.  I'll still prefer my Sennies for mixing, and I still prefer my AT's for ordinary focused PC work, but these cans are exceptionally good.  I cannot get over how good they are, affordable or not.Five stars.  When they wear out, or break, or otherwise stop making me smile, I'll just go buy another set.

    Let me start off by explaining my use-case for these headphones.I was in the market looking for something to be a good accompaniment to my brand new Oculus Quest 2. I planned on sharing the play experience with some friends, so earbuds were out of the question for sanitary reasons. I wasn't looking for stupidly-expensive headphones to have to play some VR games, but wanted something decent so Beat Saber would sound better haha. Previously, I had bought these $15 Panasonic headphones that had banger reviews, but once they arrived, I put them on, turned on some music, and instantly boxed it back up. Trash. So back to Amazon I went to look for something that's more bang-for-your-buck. I stumbled upon a bunch of non-mainstream headphones and then eventually to these. I have some Anker chargers and stuff but I never knew Anker made audio hardware, so I thought I'd read some reviews and try them out since they were on sale for $45 vs. their $60 MSRP. I knew now that if I wanted even the slightest decency in quality, I'd have to spend more than $15 haha.Next, let me explain my experience in audio hardware.I wouldn't consider myself a professional audiophile, but I know good sound when I hear it. My most expensive pair of headphones are my Sennheiser HD 650 for when I dabble in music production or want listen to music at the highest quality pair with my FiiO portable amp interface, my pair of Sony MDR-V6 (my favorite pair of headphones/ studio monitors and ol' faithful), Sennheiser CX 5.00i (hands-down best-sounding and most-balanced earbuds), 2 pairs of Sennheiser CX 300 (best-sounding alternative to the 5.00i), Beats Studio (trash), Beats Solo HD (even more trash), airpods 1st gen, and various pairs of earpods lying around. Hopefully that gives you a small glimpse of how much high-quality audio means to me...or how stupid I am for owning a couple pairs of Beats...NOW FOR THE BREAKDOWN ------Sound Quality ---- 8/10These are actually quite above decent! The price is just a bonus. I'd say the quality as normal headphones for listening to music and gaming, they're perfect. Crisp highs and good lows (with a bit of a default bass-enhancement). The mids could use a bit of work but to be honest, for $45 this is prob some of the best sound you can get at this price-point. Pretty much what a lot of these reviews say. Heck, these may be better than/ as good as  most name-brand $100-200. I've used various Bose Quiet Comfort series headphones ($300+) and haven't been impressed with their sound quality. I would say these sound just as good, if not better, than Bose QC headphones, as controversial as that may be to say haha. Another comparison is against my airpods, which I consider pretty good-sounding. I would say these are about the same as airpods, but with added bass and optional added bass on top of that. Beats muddle everything else with their added bass, while these don't IMO. Overall, sound quality on these is solid and for under $60, I would say is a steal.DO NOT USE FOR MUSIC PRODUCTION OR AS STUDIO MONITORSI only say this because there are reasons that these are just meant for listening. There are drivers in these that may not sit well with production hardware, such as an amplified audio interface, preamps, or other equipment. When I plugged this into my FiiO via the provided aux cable, the sound became unbalanced. It's probably because it wasn't meant to take in more power than it was built with, so better to leave these headphones vanilla than add anything else to them. Use them for listening or gaming and you should experience optimal sound quality. Oh and also, DON'T EVER BUY BEATS. These headphones sound eons better than any of the Beats products that I've owned/ tried, including the discontinued $400 Beats Pro.Comfort ---- 10/10These are also quite comfortable. I've worn it as long as 3-hour time period so far and the sides of my head/ ears weren't sore like after long wears of my Sennheiser HD 650s. Just like my Sony MDR-V6s they are foldable, so that may have something to do with the flexibility of its entirety. My Sennheiser HD 650s are non-foldable, and that's a big drawback for those :'(. The memory foam pads covered with faux leather allows the headphones to comfortably conform to your head shape. The only thing I can really compare the comfort to is the Beats Studio, which surprisingly, despite their build quality, are pretty comfortable. Overall, I feel like these would fit most heads and provide almost universal comfort.Features ---- meh, not much to talk aboutReally the only added features are the optional bass-boost and active noise canceling (ANC). The optional bass-boost isn't bad, it just doesn't do much for me because bass is already enhanced right outta the box. So if you're into bass-boosted and bass-heavy music, these will be quite pleasant for sure! The ANC also doesn't really do much for me since I listen to my music loud enough to drown out pretty much everything anyway. But, when I turn it on without music playing, it does do something. It's not quite as effective as the Bose QC headphones, but I think it works pretty well in most loud situations. I just haven't used it on a plane yet haha. The volume control buttons have an annoying beep every time you press + or - , but whatever. This actually sucks- you can't use the headphones while they're charging, even wired. Ridiculous, I know. But hey, can't have everything, right? Big oof on Anker's end on that.Aesthetics ---- 6/10Not gonna lie, these are pretty generic looking headphones. They don't have some revolutionary design to it, but they look like your average good-looking generic headphones. They aren't flashy like Beats or Airpods (or probably the upcoming Airpods Studio) but they don't look bad at all. They're just...normal. But, I did only get the black pair, so maybe the gray one looks better in different settings. Don't let this be a deal-breaker, though.Connectivity ---- 6/10Wired, these things are perfect. The provided cable could be longer, but that's nothing against the headphones themselves. Just buy an extender or a longer cable online for like $10 or less. THE ONLY REASON I'M KNOCKING OFF A STAR is because of what a lot of people are complaining about: the choppiness and clicking of the Bluetooth connectivity. Every now and then the headphones will click or have that split-second static noise while I'm listening via bluetooth. It's not often, but happens enough to dock a start off. Now, I could just return these and try to get another pair, but I'm too lazy and don't really care too much about the clipping every now and then, so that's on me. But, it's a problem a lot of other reviewers are complaining about so it's a legitimate issue. The range is fine so far. I've been able to walk 30 ft. away without any clipping issues. I've also used these for video calls and they work just fine with no clipping.Conclusion ---- Overall grade: 9/10You may or may not find headphones this great-sounding at this price-point or even a step up in price-point, but then again I haven't tried every single pair of headphones on the market. But I can say with confidence that these stack up pretty well against my studio headphones that I own and I would recommend these to anyone looking for decent-sounding headphones, because with these, you'll get way more than what you're looking for. These will definitely be a pleasure to play VR games with and even moreso just listening to music while at home or traveling!Now if you're looking for decent earbuds, I recommend the Sennheiser CX 5.00i! (If you haven't noticed, i'm definitely biased towards Sennheiser, but they're industry-standard and the have the best sounding audio products I've ever experience, hands-down)

    Just got these, but had to say they really sound AWESOME!  These provide the best sound I've ever heard via streaming Apple music, and that is compared with my Audio-Technica hard-wired M50s and my Beats Studio Buds (and some cheaper headphones/ear-buds).  I'm also comparing this with a good $200 DAC and high-end Bluetooth loudspeakers (or again the M50s).With default settings (ANC on, no EQ) there was a noise-floor and too much bass.  The ANC defaults to on, so the first thing I do is turn that OFF (...every time I turn-on the headphones...).  I have no use for ANC, and find any ANC does ""funny things"" to my ears, even ignoring the noise-floor.Next, I'm using Apple music, lossless, so my source material is good.  Then, I use Boom 3D and my Android phone.  I use Boom 3D pretty much everywhere, since I often like compression for those podcasts or movies with volume ""all over the place"", but that's just Windows.  Here, with these headphones on Android, Boom 3D is limited to the basic functions (EQ, and a bit of DSP effects).  Anyway, after using Boom 3D's EQ to dial-down the bass (BTW, the bass-boost on the headphones is INSANE: not for me, and BTW I'm a bass-player), I was SHOCKED how good these headphones sounded!S H O C K E D !Hey, they are still $60 headphones (not the strongest build-quality, ANC has to be turned-off every time), but for the price (...and I got them on sale...), I am VERY happy.I realize not everyone uses Boom 3D (worth a try, BTW), but I do suggest having some EQ handy to dial-down the bass, or otherwise tune these to your preferences.  The mids and highs are there, but these are definitely bass-heavy by default.

    Usually it’s always “buy the more high end stuff so you don’t regret buying the cheaper stuff and have to buy the high end stuff later anyway”Let me tell you that these headphones are probably the best headphones I’ve had. Sure. They’re not Sony. They’re not Sennheiser. But if you’re like me and you just need some tunes to tune out the world when you’re commuting, walking, working, or eating, these do the job.Keep in mind, I treat my headphones like garbage. I lost the case/bag it came in so any time I don’t need it, it gets stuffed in my backpack or thrown somewhere for me to find later. After more than a year of this kind of use, it’s still sturdy and holding strong. I haven’t even put duct tape on it, which is more than what I can say about my previous pair.Will I get the same exact pair after this inevitably dies? …No. There are better options out there nowadays. But if you’re looking for a gift for a cranky high schooler or a new college admit…hell, I’d do anything for a pair of these my freshman year in college rather than the 5 other bad, dollar-store hand-me-downs I went through.Brief description about its functionality because you might need to keep this in mind: They’re very comfortable. I’ve fallen asleep in these before. However, they do have a tendency to slip off after continuous usage so I don’t really recommend this if you’re looking to run or jog or work out. They fold in, which is great for storage. They sit around my neck easily but I have weird sensory issues with that so I don’t usually rest them there. (It’s not uncomfortable but it’s also not comfortable.) And one final thing: lately, they’ve needed a LOT of time to charge. HOWEVER, even since I’ve gotten these headphones, they last an INCREDIBLE amount of time. I think my first few times using it I’ve literally had it on 5-7 hours a day for like, two weeks, and it still has charge on it. The battery life is god tier. Nowadays, it has been more like 4-6 hours for 1 1/2-2 weeks before I need to charge it. I’ve left these suckers on during classes and meetings and man, I’m always surprised by the voice telling me I’m still on a medium charge.Don’t take my word for it though. I got a couple of friends who have been rocking their own pairs of q25s for about as long as I have, if not longer.These are solid. If you don’t want to break the bank, I’d recommend these. $300-400 for a pair of headphones in this economy?? 🤧

    This is a fantastic product. I bought it because I wanted something for my flight overseas to reduce the plane hum noise which drastically reduces jet lag.So I bought this and I was amazed how great it wasPros:* great construction, feels sturdy* good choice of colors* came with USB charge cable and regular 3.5mm (I think) jack wire so it plugged into all audio out* bluetooth pairs fast and easily* noise cancelation is excellent* sound quality overall is just amazing* the thing goes over your ears nicely without hurting your ears or making it feel like it's on fire after an hour. It has soft padding and cushioned so it really helps* you feel the whoosh -> reduced sound as soon as you put it over your ear and it auto-enables noise cancel when you power it on which is great and tells you ""Battery high"" etc. which is great* battery life is amazing. Charged it once for like 2-3hours to max and it worked for 15hr flight to and another 15hr flight back and it still said Battery high. I didn't use it all the time. Maybe for like 60-70% of the time which is still great* colors are nice and make it look classy.* it doesn't cause any issues with the band over the head* you can use it wired without needing to power it on so it uses extremely little battery* the controls are fine and the ear muffs are labeled R and L which is a nice touch* haven't tested bluetooth range but I figure it is maybe standard of working across a large room* price is very good for the performance. Sure it is not a Bose ($350+) or JVC ($200+) or some others but for $40-$50 this is truly fantastic.Cons:* the one and only con I found is if you plug in the audio jack the noise cancelation turns off immediately which is a shame. So on the plane I was watching a movie where the audio came in nicely but I could hear the little plane hum as well (it was muted but not noise canceled).Other:* didn't test the bass boost but I'm sure it is great.Overall, I liked it so much I bought 2 of them. My teenage son loved it too and he said they're really great quality and works well. The next gen opinion is important because typically they will be the supporters of such products en masse

    This is a review comparing these headphones to the Bose Quietcomfort 35 II, and the Sony WH-1000XM4.Now I know what your thinking - how could you ever compare a cheapo $50 pair of headphones to the $300+ big boys in the noise cancelling world like Bose and Sony? Well these headphones are wireless, bluetooth, active noise cancelling, and promote themselves as comfortable with balanced sound, so in my book all three of these headphones are in the same league.The criteria is simple - I don't use lab equipment to measure, I'm not concerned about exact numbers, and I don't like falling for overblown hype or marketing nonsense. I use my own experience and non-technical knowledge to decide what I like best.The Soundcore Headphones:These headphones are comfortable. Maybe it's because of the 'cheaper' materials, or they are just genuinely made with comfort more in mind, but I can wear these all day with little discomfort. I wear glasses so a little annoyance is unavoidable, but these do a bang up job of not squishing my head, while still making a good seal around my ears to keep sound quality and noise cancelling from bleeding out. I have heard some having issues with durability, but my bose quietcomfort headphones wore out and cracked over time too. Replacements are plentiful and cheap, so it's a non issue for me.Comparability and Software:These are what headphones are meant to be. Simple buttons, simple pairing, no proprietary software that I have to download, no nonsense. Just pair and play. They also have a wired mode if I'm editing video or need them to not have any delay. Bluetooth will always have a bit of a delay, but it's nothing deal breaking, a few milliseconds at most. They do not have multidevice pairing, or absolutely massive bluetooth range (it still works perfectly for me going around my whole house no problem), and there is no EQ balancing, other than the Bass Boost.Overall SoundI'm not a pro audio engineer or audiophile. If it sounds good, it's good to me. I like these headphones in normal mode just fine. While the overall sound stage is fairly tight, and it can sometimes feel cramped with complex or intricate songs, I don't feel overwhelmed in any one way or another. The negative I have here is with their 'bass boost's mode. It's fair to say it does boost the bass, at the cost of literally everything else. It almost makes it sound like every other frequency is underwater when it's turned on. I keep it off 100% of the time - it's bad.Noise Cancelling:Here is the meat and potatoes of the review. I bought these for noise cancelling and noise cancelling alone. I was surprised - they are pretty good. My air conditioner dissolves away. Car noises and wind fade to imperceptible levels, and airplane sounds go completely away. The area it falls short in is human speech. I can still hear people without much difference. Not a killer for me, but slightly lacking in that regard. They also do not give me the headache compression feeling that some other noise cancelling can give me.Comparisons:Comfort - These surprisingly win. The Bose Quietcomforts are very close, but the headpeice is slightly tighter, leading to overall head pressure discomfort over time. The Sonys are even worse, with their high weight and size they can feel heavy over time, and make my ears warm after about 1 hour.Compatibility and Software - These are also the winners! Sony and Bose just cannot help themselves when it comes to collecting data and making their customers sign up for BS accounts. I'm not a super privacy nerd either, but when I have to take a photo of my ears (looking at you Sony!) Just to listen to music, I draw the line. The Quietcomforts are better, but the Bose app is just another step in between me and my music. Bose at least keeps the physical buttons, which I enjoy because touch controls are still a bit picky in 2020. Sony knows this well, as I fumbled and accidentally turned off my music or changed the volume or song accidentally about a dozen times on their headphones. Physical buttons are arguably uglier, but I value practicality over style in this regard. The Sonys also have multidevice pairing, and their bluetooth range is just stupid far, but I don't usually run a whole football field away from my phone at a time.Overall Sound - Sony comes first, followed by Bose, and then the Soundcores. The Sony headphones are very crisp, with a wide sense of space. I genuinely couldnt stop myself from smiling when I first put them on. They induce a sense of awe, and I loved their sound immensely. The Bose was slightly worse, and only a touch better than the Soundcores. Bose has cleaner bass, and a better sense of staging, especially with singing and high hat sounds. If I were to number them by sound the Sonys get a 96, the Bose a 85, and the Soundcores a 82.Noise Cancelling - Sony once again wins, but this time the Bose and Soundcores are tied. I genuinely could not tell the difference between the Bose and Soundcores when my eyes were closed as far as noise cancelling was concered. The Sonys I could though. They do a significant better job with human voices, especially crowds like in restaurants or outside. They are still audible, but pass the point where I cannot understand what people are saying - the Bose and Soundcores fail this test.The Overall:Comparing these headphones is an excercise in diminishing returns. For $50 the Soundcores cover about 90% of what the $300 Bose Quietcomforts offer, and about 85% of what the $350 Sony WH-1000XM4 offer. To me, that remaining 10% and 15% does not justify the additional $250 and $300 price tag. Now maybe you're the kind of person who absolutely has to have the best noise cancelling, or can't live without the absolute cream of the crop perfect soundscape - and in those instances the features may justify the cost. But chances are if you're debating on these headphones you are just the average Joe consumer like me, in which case these headphones will cover everything you need without bogging you down in unnecessary features or quality thay will go unnoticed in 99% of the population. I genuinely like these headphones, and will continue to lovingly give them daily abuse until they fail me. After all, I could buy and break FIVE of these before I reached the price of one pair of Sonys.TL:DR Give them a chance, you'll more than likely find their value apparent.

    I know the pictures are odd for scale lol but i didnt have a ruler handy.  My ears fit INSIDE the cushion holes, they do NOT sit on top of my ears at all. They do not press my ears against my glasses frames which is the most important thing i was looking for.  Comfort 100/10Sound: music sounds great. No issues with bass but i dont listen to a lot of super bass heavy music. Just normal stuff, so that isnt something i pay attention to. If you are into electronic and bass heavy you may notice it, one other review mentioned it but i honestly cant tell the difference there.The noise cancelation is good, I honestly had no idea that was done by sound currents. One of the first headphones ive owned that does it. And you can turn it on and off, idk if that is a normal feature for NC headphones...Your own voice seems quieter when it is enabled. Which is pretty cool. I can still hear the tv but clearly with no music playing but its a lot quieter.With music playing i hear nothing by my own voice and the music.With cancelation off, the music is ever so slightly louder, but because of the big soft cushion its not like people next to me are staring because my music is at max volume. They dont seem to notice unless i remove them from my ears.My husband didnt notice the difference in noise cancelation being on and off with music. He cant hear that because its a very slight change. He notices it when he speaks and with no sound and the tv on though. ""It cut out white noise which is cool"" -the husband.The charger...Another D shaped micro usb. I was comparing headphones and i could have sworn these were C shaped, but i kust have been mistaken. Because im disappointed.  No one really enjoys that one pesky micro usb charger when everything seems to take C chargers lately. Not a big deal, but ever so slightly annoying. So dont lose the cord.Overall i love these. Just wish the charger was shaped better

    I got these just before a long plane trip.  I wasn’t expecting much from the noise cancellation at this price point, but I was surprised by how much it helped.  They did not totally block the plane background noise, but they reduced it significantly.Also, they worked right out of the box.  I didn’t have to set up an app or control them through my phone to get the noise cancellation function working.I like the controls on the headphones.  They’re better set up than other pairs I’ve used.One minor annoyance was that the headphones wouldn’t accept a second Bluetooth connection.  I had to manually disconnect them from one device before a second device could connect.  I’ve had other headphones that can connect to multiple devices at once, or would at least accept a new connection and switch over without me having to disconnect first.  In most use cases, this won’t come up.

    I have a pair of Beats that I love, but unfortunately, 9 years of travel wear and tear has made them fall apart and it would be cost-prohibitive to get them fixed.When I saw these Soundcore headphones, I thought that since I am a fan of their earbuds for my phone so much I would give the noise-cancelling headphones a shot, I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED!  I don't fly again for another week and a half, so I am looking forward to evaluating their active noise-canceling ability against a couple of other pairs that I have... some of them are really good. The Beats just sealed around my ears to block out unwanted noise.I think that the audio quality is every bit as good as those other headphones with the bonus of active noise cancelling.They just arrived today and I am sitting in my office putting them to the sound torture test blasting everything from Rock to Exotica to Orchestral Movie Soundtracks, they seriously exceed my expectations and I am VERY picky when it comes to audio as I have been an audio engineer, radio personality, podcaster, radio executive and so forth since 1984!I know good sound when I hear it and I know bad sound... I would pit these $40 headphones against the $200-$300 studio headphones that I have used.Seriously, surprisingly good! You just can't beat the quality at this price point.  Lots of bass, crisp high end.The only drawback thus far is that the volume is quite a bit louder using the cord than Bluetooth, but then again, that may be my Macbook's fault and not the headphones.

    First off, this is not a comparison between the Anker Soundcore Q20s and any product from Bose or Sony.. That is an unfair comparison as they are not even in the same ball park.. I know that most people want to get an understanding of how comparable they are to those but if you aren't willing to spend the money on those, you aren't going to get near what they offer..That being said, for this price range these are the best hands down.. One hit KO.. I'll list all the features separately so they are easy to find and read about.Active Noise Cancellation:Let me get some things out of the way, I work at a gas plant in a landfill as IT and Data Reporting.. My job is noisy sometimes.. I hear a constant hum from the motors in the plant right outside my door all day long.. I also travel a lot from the various plants we run.. While ANC is on these headphones won't block out immediate talking next to me or sudden loud noises, but they do block out the noise from the plant.. That is without the music.. I do need to point out that the talking is trying to talk over motors so it's louder than your average office space. When the music is on and running, it adds a whole separate layer to the cancellation as I can no longer hear anything else..Sound:I don't typically have music up loud, most I've turned them up to is 50% because I've been rough on my ear drums since I was a kid playing drums at a young age.. As I've gotten older I've been more prone to try and protect my ears.. That being said, the sound quality is very nice with or without ANC engaged.. I find it's way more enjoyable with ANC on due to everything else being tuned out.. Some headphones will warp the sound when ANC is turned on, these do not.. The sound is as impressive with the feature on as it is off.. This is incredible.. I listen to a range of music from Rap and Hip-Hop to Metal and Hard Rock and they all sound clear and precise in these headphones..They do have a bass-up feature that increases the bass a little more.. This works well without muddying the sound quality too much.. I imagine if you increase the volume too much it might diminish but from my listening around the 50% max it's been outstanding.. Bass gains can be a real hit and miss for me as some lose sound quality.. With these that's not the case..Quality:The headphones feel amazing.. They have a nice weight to them (which is not for everyone). I personally like a little weight to my equipment.. It is sturdy and feels solid.. I was afraid of it feeling a little too plastic like but they really don't.. Now they aren't as nice as your $200-$300 headphone, but again, their price range they are amazing quality.. The ear cups are very comfortable and soft memory foam.. I was actually surprised that my ears don't get as hot as normal.. They will overtime due to the design.. It's impossible to get around since it traps heat, but these seem like they don't get as warm as fast.. Also the ear cups feel amazing.. I've literally worn them all day yesterday and felt no ear fatigue or strain.. This is a solid!Functionality:A feature that isn't talked about a lot with these is the awesome ability to connect to not just one but two devices simultaneously.. Now a note on that: You cannot listen to two devices at the same time.. What is going on is I'm able to connect to my computer and listen to music on it while being connect to my phone at the same time.. When someone calls me and I answer, it swaps input to my iPhone and stops playing the music in my ears.. Once the call is finished, it swaps back to my computer and I resume listening.. This is an amazing feature that I use daily!Battery:The battery is very nice.. When I received my unit the first thing I did was pair it to my devices (of course) and started checking it out.. I received them with 60% battery.. I used them the rest of that day at work for a couple of hours.. then when I left, used them a little more at the house and watched half of a movie on them before going to bed.. They were still at 60%.. The box says that they last 40 hours and that is accurate.. If you don't use the Bass-Up technology you can squeeze even more.. and to not use the ANC it goes up higher.. 40 hours for battery life though is incredible for this price range.. I cannot complain!Packaging:The packaging was very nice and well put together.. It came with a charge cable and 3.5mm aux cable (which is great for my Nintendo Switch when I fly).. While I would have loved to seen a USB-C type adapter (as would many others) that is still an expensive change to make and would probably bump the price up out of the $60 range.. I understand from a manufacturing point the reasoning to possibly go with a micro-USB.. It would be nice for C, but it is what it is.. That doesn't change how well this thing is made and works.. The only gripe I have and it's a minor thing is the case they come with.. Well, you can't call it a case cause it's just a bag.. Now, it's a very nice bag, but I throws these buys in a backpack with a laptop and iPad and Switch (in a hardcase) and so a bag doesn't really protect your headphones.. Luckily I had a nice hard case from a cheap pair of headphone I received a few years ago (the case was the nicest part) and they fit perfectly.. So if you don't have one buy a hard case for them..Overall:Overall, for the price these are the best hands down.. You really cannot beat their ANC and sound quality for this price.. I will definitely buy these again and probably buy my wife some so she'll stop stealing mine.. If it was out of 10, I'd give this product a 9/10 simply due to no hard shell case..

    UPDATE, 2/29/20: Anker Customer Service has provided me an updated pair of the headphones for reevaluation. I have not experienced the popping issue at all with the new pair, so I am updating my rating to 4 stars. I still really enjoy the sound from these while ANC is on; strong, fun bass, and not at the expense of the mids and treble. Also, customer service also sent me replacement earpads in the event that they fail over time.Once again, I cannot say enough about how amazing Anker's customer service is. Many companies out there could learn a lot from how much they want their customers to be satisfied!UPDATE, 1/31/20: Unfortunately these are being returned, for 2 reasons:1) I'm getting the popping noise whenever I take off the headphones while playing in ANC mode (which is always). This simply cannot happen for headphones at any price point, much less $60.2) I can see already that the earpad leatherette covering is beginning to pull away from the housing. Since receiving the headphones, I have treated them with kid gloves, so in less than 2 weeks time I'm already beginning to see potential for long term build quality issues.So, as with other reviewers, bummed that these just don't live up to Anker quality. Leaving them at 2 stars as they are serviceable, but not a long term gamble I'm willing to take.ORIGINAL REVIEW, 1/25/20:We live in a world of excess. Headphones are a prime example of this. Not only are there many ""name brand"" manufacturers of headphones out there (Sony, Bose, Beats. et. al.), there are now endless ""no-name"" brands peddling junk. There are a handful of companies trying to find some middle ground, TaoTronics, Mpow, and, of course, Anker Soundcore. When it comes to headphones, at least for me, is value for price paid. Without a doubt, the more expensive headphones by Sony & Bose offer the best quality across the board, but they're not such a great value, at least for my needs. And to go super cheap with no name brands is a waste of time, as you'll make major sacrifices. Anker is trying to establish itself as the sweet spot for solid value without making too many sacrifices.Like other reviewers, I have used other Anker products, some good, some not so good. Their charging products are nothing short of spectacular. Their audio products, on the other hand, have always been hit or miss. I decided to take a chance on the Q20 headphones because A) they are a few generations in, so hopefully Anker has made improvements over time, and; B) they sit at a great price point (between $40-60 depending on timing). Not cheap, but not astronomical either.So after using them for a week, and making the decision not to return them (I have returned countless headphones), I wanted to share my first impressions. Maybe these will change over time as the build quality ages, or sound quality evolves with burn-in, but I wanted to try and help those on the fence with some honesty rather than the endless one line five star reviews.PROSComfort. While these are in no way portable, they are fairly light and not overly bulky. Most of the cheaper over-ears are simply too much like earmuffs in an attempt to maximize comfort and/or improve sound quality.Sound Quality. This one is both a pro and a con, so I will come back to this below. For the most part, I enjoy the sound quality on these. Admittedly, I like extra oomph in the bass, and these are definitely bass headphones.Battery Life. Gave them a full charge when I received them, and probably won't need to charge them again for likely...weeks. Since I only use them at work and occasionally around the house, I expect the battery to last quite a while.Value. So far, I feel like I am getting every cent out of my investment in these. Sure, they are not perfect (as you will see below), but for the price paid, they are meeting my expectations.CONSNoise Canceling. Yeah, Anker threw in noise canceling as that feature is hot right now. It's there, but it's mediocre. Would I trust it if I was a frequent traveler? No. That would be worth an investment in Bose or Sony. But at work and around the house, it's fine. I haven't encountered the popping issues other reviewers have experienced, so I will have to wait and see on that.Build Quality. This is where Anker was able to keep the price point low. These aren't the most solidly built, but they are passable so long as they are handled decently. A case would have mitigated this, but again, cost. The buttons are not the best, and over time I can tell that these will likely be the first things to fail.Sound Quality. Here is where I will contradict myself. There is a discernible difference in the bass level between noise canceling being off vs. on. When off, the cans really thump with bass, which is great when listening to pop, hip hop, or EDM. It's too overpowering for most rock songs, as it drowns out pretty much everything else. It's still listenable, but gets exhausting after awhile. With noise canceling on, it's better, but it seems like the sound quality degrades somewhat with the added layer of processing. Not a steep decline, but it does mean that I leave the noise cancellation on all the time, which will result in the battery dying quicker. Not a deal breaker.TL;DR: So overall, I recommend these headphones if you are looking for a solid pair of cans at a reasonable price, KNOWING WHAT YOU ARE BUYING. These are not going to give you superior performance on any feature, except for battery life. They are definitely acceptable for what you're paying for, and so long as the build quality holds up, should meet your needs for a couple of years. And if not, Anker has an 18-month warranty on defects, and their customer service is A+.

    I’ve had this headset going on 3 years now after seeing it on TikTok and it’s one of the best most affordable purchases I’ve ever made. I originally got it for MCAT studying because of the noise cancellation which I think works super well. There are certain frequencies of things that don’t get cancelled out like knocking on a table or loudly flipping a book page, but there’s still such a huge difference with the cancellation. I used to live on a busy street in a big city and I couldn’t hear anything once I engaged the noise cancellation.The battery life is excellent. I use it maybe a few hours a week and I don’t usually charge it for months. The connection is good and sound quality is pretty clear. The only problem I have is that it’s a little bulky and kind of hard to store (even with the pouch they give you, the headset doesn’t fold in as smoothly). But the headset is also extremely durable and hasn’t broken in the 3 years I’ve had it. Again, one of my best purchases given the quality of product compared to other noise cancelling headphones. Highly recommend for studying especially if you like to listen to music or even just to block out other sounds.

    Just got it today. My other headphones of a different brand went out today after about a year of heavy use and I needed something urgent because I love listening to music. It came 80% charged so that was great. I'll see how long 80% will last me.I was surprised how good the noise cancellation was because on other headphones on Amazon I saw reviews saying it's not really noise cancelling, but these are the real deal. I was frying chicken while listening to them and when I took them off for a second I was surprised how loud the grease was even though I was standing right in front of it the whole time. Tbh I don't really notice a big difference between the noise cancellation being on and off. But it's no big deal.The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it's a little warm therefore making my ears a little sweaty. I can imagine it will be more sweaty in the summer. I don't remember my last headphones making my ears sweaty at all.Other than that they are perfect headphones.

    I’ve had these headphones for three years now & it still takes a very long time to drain the battery. I love how everytime you turn them on a voice tells you how charged they are. They also charge quick, last long & can go a pretty good distance. I’ll be bluetoothed to my iPad in the house & can walk halfway through my yard before it’s starts getting spotty & looses connection. I can be in any room in my house even through thick walls & still remain completely connected. They also extend in size for people with larger noggins. My only complaints are the material on the soft earpiece is starting to wear away & I get little residual black pieces on my ears & hair. It dusts off fine, though & it took 3 years & plenty of uses for that to even happen. I also hate how long you have to hold the power button especially when turning them off. But neither of those things are really that bad. I highly recommend them for quality, decent sound, noise cancelling, long battery life & remaining connected well when walking away from their source.

    For the price point these two very well. The noise canceling works well for when I travel and I have to write a bus, train, plane etc.The volume is a little lower when you're using noise canceling, but that is to be expected but is by no means low. They are very comfortable. Battery management is pretty slick as on my phone I could actually see the percentage of battery that is available. Why more companies don't take advantage of this Bluetooth feature I have no idea.The only thing that I do not like about these headphones is the fact that it's not using USB c. In this day and age they should definitely be using USBC. I knew this going in so I can't give it a negative mark for it but I really wish that they had this feature.

I bought these headphones on January 24th, 2024 for $59.99 (I always like when people add price and date so I can see if the “sale” is actually even a sale.)So far, I am LOVING these headphones. I’m a musician’s wife and mom of an autistic kiddo, so we had a chance here to test just how good they sound and how well the noise canceling works. Myself and my husband both agreed that they have really good sound for $60 headphones! They’re also fairly light, not too light that they feel cheap but they are light especially compared to my Bose headphones that were smaller. They are WAY more comfortable than my Bose headphones, and I wear glasses. My Bose ones would sandwich the arms of my glasses between my head and ears and would hurt so bad by the end of the day. But with these, I wear them for 8 hour shifts every single day and so far no pain whatsoever from my glasses. I also love that you can also have noise canceling on or off while your music is playing, which is helpful at my job because I still need to hear when someone approaches me and starts to talk so I usually have it off. But at home, with my husband being a musician like I mentioned- it’s nice that if I’m wanting to listen to something I can have noise canceling on and listen to my music or podcasts when he’s working in his studio.The noise canceling works really well! It’s not 100%, but I prefer that so I can still be aware of my surroundings. The video here is of my autistic daughter, she had noise sensitivities but they’re not severe- enough that she gets upset sometimes when her dad is recording drums. Today we decided to try these headphones with the noise canceling on with no music, and she had not a single care in the world so clearly it does make a huge difference. Usually she would cover her ears with her hands if she was sitting where she is in the video, which shares a wall with the studio. The only time she doesn’t cover her ears is when she’s 3 walls away, so for her to be right next to the studio just chillin with the headphones means they definitely work. She has noise canceling headphones that are specifically made just for that, they don’t have Bluetooth or audio jack capabilities so they’re specifically for noise canceling and she hates those- I think they’re too tight and heavy because they’re filtering out basically all sound completely. She’s 100% content with these on though and I feel that speaks to the comfort.I’m not a headphone snob, but I know a decent pair of headphones when I have them. These are a solid choice if you just want an overall good pair of headphones! When these finally do give up- I’ll update this review. They are still brand new essentially but at this point I’m VERY happy with them.

    Wow- I didn’t expect all that much from these headphones, as they are a lower priced over the ear headphone, but boy, was I blown away! They truly are noise canceling! The sound is crisp and clear. I also have not had to charge them yet, and I am using them daily, so the battery holds well. I have pretty small ears and a head, but they fit nicely and don’t hurt or move too much. I have not worked out with them yet (I prefer AirPods for that), but I am sure they would be good for a lifting session (not sure on cardio). If you’re looking for a cheaper option, these headphones are definitely it!

    Normally, Anker products are really good, but these are dissapointing.If these where just headphones, they would be fine, they are comfortable, sound good (not audiophile good, but good enough), look kinda good (if a tad cluncky). But these are supposed to be noise cancelling headphones. And they do not cancel noise at all.The only discernible effect when you enable noise cancelling is that the headphones pump up the volume of what you are listening, but, once you compensate for that, the external sound dampening you get is the same that you would get by just the cushions of the headphones.Mind you, I tested with a punny Nokia E71 playing TMBG's Call_connected_through_the_NSA.mp3 not some hollywood explosion fest. I do not want ""world around dissapears"" kinds of Noise Cancelling, but if these can't cancel a punny E71... Well, disappointed/dissapointingEdit #1:The reason I hold Anker in high regard, I because of their customer service, and this is no exception. I posted the review in about July 18, 2020, and today July 21, 2020 they contacted me. At least we know they still have top notch customer support, even during a pandemic.Nonetheless, their sugestions were not very usefull:«- Make sure the NC button is turned on(the NC indicator would turn green) when you want them to cancel noise outside.»Yes, I know very well how to press the button to get the green light, and also, a very nice lady voice says ""Noice Cancelling"", so yes, I was 110% (one hundred and ten percent)  sure noice cancelling was active.«- Try the headphones in different noisy places with NC on and off and see any difference.»Well, we are under lockdown. When I am able to move out, I have more important thing to do than test noise cancelling headphones. Nonetheless, I'll try to do it and report back to Anker Customer Support, and to you guys. I'll also try to get the 10 min silent MP3s from Samir Mezrahito really test this out.Edit #2:I was ""finally"" able to actuate on Anker product support's sugestion and ""- Try the headphones in different noisy places with NC on and off and see any difference."".For testing purposes I used the headphones in BlueThooth mode (to eliminate any electrical intereference noise). And used the song ""A a a a a a a a a Very good song"" by artist Samir Mezrahi, which, as you perhaps know, consists of almost 10 min of silence.I tested in various scenarios:1.) In my car, windows down.2.) In my car windows up.3.) Reving up my car to 2500rpm (in the parking lot).4.) In a bus stop (with buses comming in and out).5.) In the electric stairs of a ghostly empty shopping mall.6.) In a queue to pay for medicines (with ambient music and people talking at moderate volume).7.) Near the air extractor of my home kitchen.My results:1.) If wind blows in the headphones you actually get MUCH MORE noise with NC on than with NC off, so forget using the noise cancelling in a ferry boat, or in a bus with no Air conditioning, or in your car with windows/roof open, or in your bike.2.) The NC was able to diminish humming noises (like the engine), but not clacking noises, or noises derived from potholes and such.3.) The NC was very effective at mitiganting the reeving.4.) The engine noise from the buses was mitigated, but not the clacking or the chatter from the people waiting.5.) Again, the humm of the motor of the staris was mitigated, but not the clacking noises.6.) In the queue, the souund of the air conditioner or the store was somewhat mitigated by the NC, but not the ambient music or the chatter, and that actually ended up being worse, because it made more noticeable the music and chatter.7.) The NC was decent with the air extractor of my kitchen.But, in scenarios 5, 6 & 7, I noticed that the NC tends to cancel the low frequencies, but the high ones are not mitigated at all (currently at my 47yo, i can hear up to 15Khz, so for younger peiople is probably worse), so, actually enabling NC will make any high pitch noice more noticeable (i.e. the frequency responce of the NC is not flat).Finally, if one bought these headphones with NC because the noise made by rain, the AC fan or compressor, or some other noise like that was disturbing, it it will diminish it a little (but not much), but if one bought noise cancelling headphones because one wanted to evade the sound of coworkers talking, or kids playing in the garden or your SO watching TV in the other room, these headphones will do nothing  more than what headphones with no NC (and therefore less expensive) would have.Edit #3 (and Final):Anker contacted me, and offered two options, return the item (as a very special consideration, since I am a few MONTHS completely outside of the return window), or get a refund for 20% of the cost, to get a more suitable Item. Since I order to the USoA and then have my Items forwarded to Venezuela, it is a hassle to return Items, so I opted for the refund, and it went smoothly.That is the good thing of going with Anker. The litmus test of a good company comes when things go wrong, and Anker has a stellar reputation for making things right. Upgraded the review from one star to 4, but not on the account of the product itself, but rahter, due to the excellent customer service.

    I recently bought those headphones and I’d tell you that they are worth all money. I use them at work where the environment is somewhat noisy. I was irritated high pitch noise and this the reason why I bought them. They not cancel all the noise, you still can hear some noise but it muffled to a comfortable level. Compare to my not noise canceling headphones Sony where I need to put the volume up to 100% I can hear the difference. I use it at 65% of volume and can hear clearly. Pads are super soft and since I have the headphones not that long I can’t state how long they are going to last.

    I've owned Beats, Bose, Sony headphone all costing 3-4 times more than these.  Unfortunately I have a propensity for leaving my headphones at the gym.  I bought a pair of these and quite frankly, there was minimal difference in sound quality, perhaps a little, but not worth paying a few hundred dollars extra for. I'm passed the point of conspicuous consumption and trying to impress people with having name brands.  If you are  of similar mindset, these will more than do the trick for you, then you can spend the money you saved on  something else. You won't be dissapointed.

    I saw these on a Today's Deal sale, and like a drug addict that likes hopscotch, I busted out the chalk sidewalk and started researching.Everyone loves these headphones. Your mom will love these headphones. They are not $300 Bose ANC headphones. (ANC stands for Always Be Closing. Sit Down. Coffee is for closers.) But they are 80-90% as good as Bose Active Noise Cancelling headphones at 1/5 the cost. You'll need to ask your kid or younger brother to help with that Algebra, but let's just say x = incredible value.Apparently Soundcore is an Anker company. This isn't obvious in some of the reviews you will undoubtedly read while on the toilet. But it's Anker made. Who hasn't had great experience with Anker stuff? Your purchase history here on Amazon already has 14 Anker purchases. This won't be your first or your last Anker purchase. Aside from making you feel dumb with your friends because no one can agree how to pronounce the ""a"" in Anker, their products are solid performers at a good price.And that's how I'd describe these headphones - like a really nice Honda amongst Acura, Lexus, etc. Or a really good TV dinner where they get the cheese right. These Soundcores are not beautiful. They won't help you get the girl (or the guy. or the cute non-binary person you saw Wednesday). But they absolutely will make you feel glad you bought them.They are solid in the hand, if a little cheap feeling - but only next to high end headphones. They aren't flimsy by any stretch (do not try to stretch them). The plastic is thick and has a matte finish. The headband adjustment is solid - easy to move and stays in place once set. Comfort is excellent. The earphone cushions are buttery soft (and not all greasy like butter. That would be gross. Butter on your ears sucks.) The soft ear cushions make a great seal on your ears and don't hurt after wearing for hours, even with glasses.Some reviewes mention that these headphones can get a little sweaty. That does not mean the headphones themselves. These headphones produce almost zero perspiration themselves. But they may make your head/ears/ear area sweat. Because of the great seal made by the cushions, and due to the material being all natural vinyl or something, it can make things a little warm after an hour. But if you're sitting at the bus stop in this humid heat, your ears are gonna sweat. At least these headphones will protect your ears from the loud noises of the bus and the other people at the bus stop who won't stop talking about Sammy and why he took off. You don't need to hear that story again. Poor Sammy.The ANC (not the chain of movie theaters) is good. For headphones at this price, the noise cancelling is excellent. So I guess that means the noise cancelling is excellent. At this price. These aren't high end Bose, dum-dum. These will remove a lot of exterior sound like a droning fan, dogs barking, a baby crying, a spouse asking you to do something, a police officer telling you that you can't lie here, a drive through operator asking you want you want over and over and over.I haven't tried these on a plane yet. But I will. If I say I'll come back and update this review after using them on a plane, that would feel disengenuous, because we both know that's not going to happen. I feel like there is a modicum of trust and intimacy established at this point, and I don't want to harm that. So let's just agree to disagree, OK? I bet these will be great on a plane.Sound is really really good. I won't say excellent because you might like artificially enhanced Beats-like bass response, and if you do, trying to explain what ""subjective"" means will take too long. I'm kidding. If you really like a bunch of bass, that doesn't mean you are stupid. I don't think calling someone stupid is OK. You just have terrible taste and judgment and probably only give 40% effort at everything.These sound clear and crisp. Bass response is good without being overbearing. (for those who really like heavy bass, that has nothing to do with bears).Sound is great. Really great. Way better than those earbuds you've been using that start to feel uncomfortable after 45 minutes. Go on, take the plunge. I promise you will happy with your purchase and grateful to me and then we can be friends. You will love these headphones. Later, you will learn to love me.I can tell you are losing interest. I know that look. I'll wrap this up. Buy these headphones. You won't be disappointed. Get a cheap hard case. I found one on Amazon for around $9. Now you have noise cancelling g headphones that sound great, fit great, last a very long time on a single charge, and you'll invest way under $100 all in. You will be the envy of your friends. Or at least your friends' ears.

    Got this on sale around $40 about two weeks ago. Way better than other headphones I have tried in the same price range $40-60.  This is my third set of Soundcore products. I have been pretty happy with each of them, which is why I was comfortable going a bit beyond my initial budget.The noise canceling works great and has the option of being turned off. It's amazing to feel the sense of silence that the active noise canceling creates.  Great for sensory processing, even when using this feature without music or a movie.The on/off/connected sounds and voice are pleasant and the volume for these can be adjusted independent of the headset volume. No loud annoying voice breaking my ear drum to let me know it's on, or the battery is low.Sound is crisp and clear with good mid tones and bass. I have only used these for watching movies so far but they seem to have a good range and I can actually hear background noises in films that I hadn't been able to pick up on before.  The listening experience is pleasant and encompassing.I took one phone call so far and I could hear the other person well. They seemed to hear me fine. I did not ask for their feedback so I'm unsure of the sound quality in that regard.The control buttons are easy to understand and use and the headset itself is adjustable and comfortable. I do have a small head so every full headset like this is always just a fraction too large, but with this set it doesn't hurt my head or ears. I have piercings and the soft ear cups do not irritate them.Only downside is that the charging port is for a micro-usb, but that is just a minor inconvenience.So far the charge lasts me a few days with some pretty heavy use, including leaving them on when I pause a show and get caught up doing something else.Easy to connect via Bluetooth. I have not tried these line-in yet.Good purchase, even at normal price. I usually put a lot of effort researching different products to find affordable items that are still  good quality. I'm glad I went with this headset as it surpassed my expectations.

    The headphones were inexpensive compared to some of the other options. My main gripe is that the instruction manual that came with it is printed in a microscopic typeface in LIGHT BLUE ink, rendering it impossible to read without a magnifying glass and a strong light. I found a more readable version on the product's website, but it was confusingly written. I managed to figure it out finally, but what's wrong with having a simple diagram that points to and identifies each of the three buttons on the headphones. It's also difficult to see the black on black buttons. Letters and markings are etched or pressed into the plastic. How hard would it be to apply a bit of white or red paint so that the functions are easier to see? I even need a flashlight to determine which side is L and which is R. Yeah, I'm a grumpy old man with poor eyesight.On the plus side: the noise canceling feature works well and they sound good and they were way cheap compared to Bose for example.

    I've always found myself in a bit of a quandary: I'm an audiophile on a budget. I've tried several in-ear buds and they've all let me down on sound quality and noise cancelation. I tried these on a whim since they're so highly rated, and wow am I glad I did!! The noise cancelation is great--I can sit in a noisy coffee house and only barely hear anything beyond my music without cranking the volume to dangerous levels. The sound quality truly is HD or HiFi. Will it rival Bose headsets that cost 8-10x as much? No. But the difference in price is much greater than the difference in sound quality.Comfort-wise, they're a 9.5 out of 10. You won't forget they're on your head, but close. The angle of the earpieces is perfect and the memory foam is so comfy.If you're still reading this, just go ahead and buy them. You won't be sorry. Plus, the blue color is much better than it looks in the photos. It makes them look way more expensive than they are.

    Due to the autism, I must wear headphones a lot and so I've been trying different ones when my old ones break to see if i can find the perfect headphones. Finally, after 2 years my JLab studio pros gave out, so I was on the hunt for new ones when these popped up at an insane discount. Probably the best money I've spent on a pair of headphones. The noise canceling doesn't make me nauseous like others have in the past and the ear cups are very padded and comfortable for long-term use. Very happy with my purchase and with the headphones. The audio quality is slightly better than the previous pair, idk if my assessment is fair as the old pair is 2 years old, but they are great! Very satisfied! Already sent the link to everyone in a similar situation i know!

    The only thing I would change is the packaging, compared to the overall feel of quality construction, the packaging is a let down. However inside you’ll find a great product with superior features. I love the fit and feel on head, and most of all..the sound quality is amazing. I bought these for an inexpensive temporary replacement for my Beats Studio 3’s that stopped charging. Now I don’t need to replace or repair them, the costs to do so was more than the cost of these. Plus these out perform the Beats hands down! Awesome couldn’t be more happy!😎

    I grabbed these while on a trip; I have an old pair of Sony XM3 noise cancelling headphones I normally use on the plane, but since my wife was using them for her own trip, it left me needing something for the 5 hour flight.  Grabbed these since the price was right and I could get them from Amazon overnight.I wasn't expecting them to be as good as my Sonys, but they did surprise me, ESPECIALLY at their price point.  These things punch well above their price.-Noise Cancelling: not as good as the XM3s, but enough to dull the engine roar and passenger chatter, which was all I was expecting.  4 stars here, as I'm not sure you'd get a better ANC experience without spending 3x as much.-Sound Quality: very impressed, for the price.  A little muddy in the mids/highs, but these aren't audiophile headphones.  Bass was fantastic (regardless of price).-Comfort/Build: on the cheap side (but they're under $50, so well within expectations).  5 hours on the plane with no issues, plenty of battery life remaining.  I wear a 7 5/8 hat, so I struggle finding headphones that don't squeeze my melon - these were completely fine.If you have $50 and need some decent BT headphones, get these.  Don't buy them specifically for the ANC, but it's a nice bonus to have at this price point.  Fantastic general-use/flight headphones, and I'll be keeping them as spares for flights.

    I bought these because I have a lot of travel coming up and can never find a pair of headphones that work for me. They either hurt my ears, don’t stay in, or are too big. So I decided to go with over the ear style headphones and went with these. These are INCREDIBLE!!!! They are so comfortable you can hardly feel that you’re wearing them. The battery life is unmatched, I’ve worn them for a 6 hour flight, a 4 hour flight, and another 3 hour flight and still have basically a full battery. I love that it comes with an aux cord adapter because I was able to plug into the plane and watch a movie if I wanted to. I’m so impressed with the sound quality and the noise canceling feature as well.

    I was late to the game with noise cancelling technology. Sometimes my environment can be noisy and I had been using foam earplugs as a solution. I finally decided to give these a try. I've used Anker products in the past and have always been happy with the quality and affordability. These are no different. And I now understand how incredible noise cancelling is. Total game changer. It really cancels out the majority of the noises around me. Of course something really loud will still get through, but otherwise extremely silent. Sounds quality is also great. But I'm no audiophile. There are probably better sounding units, but at this price I'm extremely happy.

    These are great. The sound is rich and the noise cancelling works well enough for me. While I can still hear some of my surroundings, the irritating sounds are drowned out when I use the ANC. Example: When I cook on the stove and need to use the vent fan, I can still hear it but it's not painful. The noise cancelling does a pretty good job even when not turned on. I also like that they are really adjustable.  The only thing I'm annoyed about is that you can't use the app with this one (although the app is not necessary.)

    Had these on my Amazon shopping list for some time now and finally bit the bullet when they dropped 33% I don't plan on using these a whole lot just while traveling. The noise cancelling seems to work pretty good when i turn it on/off with a fan running on high. Just not sure how well it'll hold up to plane noise. It does come with an AUX cord which is what you'll need to use if you're plugging in to the planes TV. Otherwise the bluetooth worked fine. My one gripe is I wish it came wish it came with a better case. I suppose at this price point you cant expect a hard case but the bag it comes with doesn't even fully fit the headphones.

    La verdad vengo de usar audífonos beats y Sony; ya tocaba reemplazar y quise darle la oportunidad a esta marca con unos de baja gama y la verdad suenan hermoso, soy amante a los bajos y superó mis expectativas que me deja con un sólo botón enfatizar el bajo. Adicional a esto debo agregar que el material se siente firme y premium, incluye bolsa.  Sí así suenan los de primera gama y que compite tranquilamente con audífonos de $250 dólares, cómo será cuando me compre los nuevos.

    I have been a Bose devotee for a long time as well as an in the ear headphone person. My last pair of Bose were disappointing and since I had put out so much money for them, I wanted just a regular noise cancelling headphone for using when doing homework. I was wary of getting an over the ear headphone, but these were on sale and had decent reviews. I was amazed at the comfort from the start. The ear cups are perfectly angled for your ears. The sound quality is wonderful. The noise cancelling is the best I’ve had for a lower priced headphone and very close to what I’m used to with Bose. You can still hear some noises but they are very much quieter. Great buy!

    I was so happy with these we ordered another set for my wife to use. Very comfortable to wear, easy to pair with our tablets that we use to stream. We found the sound quality and NC function to be excellent for us. Haven't found a need to boost the bass, sounds great just the way it is out of the box, so far the batteries are holding up very well. Charge the battery in them before you start using them for the best results.

    I have an exercise bike that has gotten increasingly noisier over time and it clacks. It can be very distracting and I even found myself peddling lightly. I thought headphones might help. When I looked online I started seeing ads for this noise cancellation technology. I thought it was probably a gimmick but I decided to give it a try when I stumbled across this deal. I have no idea how this is even possible but it worked. I found myself taking them off a few times just to make sure it was still making noise. The difference is night and day. I had no problem linking it to my quest 2 or Apple TV. It’s as simple as holding down the button until it flashes and finding Soundcore when it pops up on the screen.

    I was in the market for some new headphones. I had a pair of Bluetooth headphones, a different brand for about six years, they finally started to wear down and sound quality, didn’t appear as loud as they were, which is expected after Bluetooth headphones are used continuously. For context, I used mine every day, Probably the only time I didn’t use them as well I was sick, so I would say I used my headphones, probably 355 days out of the year. So you could imagine how heavily used they were. Anyways, enough of my rambling, you want to read the review.  I went looking for more of an upgrade for my old headphones, I wanted something with noise, canceling features, as I have bad anxiety, and sometimes just need to escape from noise. So, when I saw reviews of these headphones were rather positive in the sound department, I had to give them a chance.  I love music, it’s my number one escape from stress in life, so you bet I take shopping for audio products very seriously. The sound quality on. These is great, there is deep base, and that’s just out of the box, I’ve heard, it’s even better when you set an EQ in the app. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to do that, because the app won’t detect my headphones, I don’t know if that’s just my pair, or if this particular  Model of headphones isn’t supported by the app. So I’ve just left it to rest, they sound good out of the box anyways. If you’re looking for a pair of noise, canceling headphones with deep base under $100, I think soundcore is the way to go,  I might be biased because I like soundcore products, I own a soundcore mini three if you were wondering. But even people who weren’t familiar with soundcore, and used other brands told me they liked these better when I got them a pair. My girlfriend was very loyal to JBL, and I got hurry  Pair of soundcore headphones in the gray variant, for Christmas, and she is in love with her headphones. So even people who were very apprehensive about something non-JBL, praises it heavily, that tells me how good these headphones are. Get a pair for yourself, and they also make a great gift for a family member or friend, who sometimes needs to escape noise.  or if they just love music. Or both, like myself.

    After wearing a more famous brand of headphones for years, I tried this pair and was blown away with what I'd been missing. The ear cup padding is very comfortable, and they adjust and swivel to fit against your head to help muffle outside noise (without being too tight). The quality of the music sound is very good, and phone calls are crisp and clear. These charge quickly, and hold a charge for a long time. Overall, this set of headphones comes at a really good price for the quality! Highly recommend!

    Solid sound quality. Not much for customization offer wise but sound is good. Even with bass booster, I still want more bass. I think this has a crisper sound than Beats Solo (I had the gen 1s, so not sure how newer models compare) but I think the beats still had a more bass-y sound. It just really hit.This still hits but I still want more bass!Would be upset if I paid full $60, but I’m not sure what other models I would have even gone for? JBLs?Update: oddly enough I turned the whole headset around so that the R and L are on the “wrong” side and it sounds great. Bass boost up hits!

    I travel quite a bit, and my wired Sennheiser PXC-250's have bit the dust. My first thought was Bose or Sony, but when I saw these on a flash sale, I gave them a shot. They are so comfortable, and cover the entire ear, adding to the sound isolation, the NC works really well, and the Bluetooth works great. I paired it to my Samsung S21 Ultra, and it was obvious it needed some sound adjustment. After a half hour of equalization and tweeking adjustments, they sound as good as any headphone I have ever listened too. Just fantastic. I also wear them at industrial sites where the noise is eardrum damaging, I hardly hear anything. For well under $50, its a no brainer.

    I recently purchased the SENSYNE 62"" Phone Tripod & Selfie Stick, and I love it!!. As a new and upcoming photographer. I was on the lookout for an affordable yet reliable selfie stick that I could take with me anywhere that was not too heavy, and this tripod/selfie stick combo has proven to be an excellent choice. I am very short and could never hold the phone and take pics at the same time. This extendable feature of the tripod allows me to capture shots from various angles and heights, providing versatility to my photography. The 62-inch height is particularly advantageous for group photos or capturing stunning landscapes. The ability to transform it into a selfie stick adds an extra layer of functionality, making it an all-in-one solution for my photography needs. I don't have to stretch to get the perfect picture anymoreOne of the standout features, that I like is the wireless remote, which adds convenience to my photo sessions. Being able to control the shutter remotely ensures that I can be a part of the frame without any hassle. The setup is incredibly user-friendly, making it perfect for someone like me who is just starting in the world of photography. I love the price and the look of this stick. Highly recommend it!Not only is the SENSYNE 62"" Phone Tripod & Selfie Stick cost-effective, but it also delivers on performance. It's an ideal companion for any aspiring photographer, offering a seamless blend of affordability, ease of use, and functionality. I highly recommend this product to fellow beginners or anyone in search of a reliable and budget-friendly tripod/selfie stick solution.

    I bought this for my 8 year old daughter she loves makes videos of herself dancing or doingGymnastics and she kept trying to find places and ways around the house where she can rest her phone in a way to record herself. This tripod is great. Very sturdy, light enough to carry around easy to take the phone off and on. High adjustment is great and the bonus is definite the Bluetooth remote. She can start her video or take a picture using the remote instead of having to walk up and away to start/stop her videos. Would definitely recommend.

    So I’m writing a review about this part of this is my fault. The other part is product defect I purchased this a while back and I didn’t use it for about a month or so after I purchased it and on my first time using it, it worked great, but when I went to collapse it to put it away in the picture as you could see, the bottom part broke on me. The unfortunate part which is frustrating is that it’s a third-party not from Amazon but Amazon help me out still but the problem was I couldn’t exchange it because I was passed my time on it even though it was my first time using it frustrating but rules are rules but I’m just writing a review about it and that’s all yes I like it. Yes I will probably buy one more of these but I wanted to show what the product did on me the first time using it that’s all.

    We really like these tripods! We’ve used them for our family photos, for recording videos and for recording games with friends. The only thing I don’t really like is the “selfie stick” part. I thought that it would come with a separate piece for a handle but you just collapse the tripod stand part and use that as the handle and we’ve pinched our hand a few times trying to use it, but we honestly don’t use that function that often anyway.

    This is a great tripod. I honestly only have one complaint and it’s the lack of motion where you connect your phone. It moves a decent amount, don’t get me wrong. But for what I was purchasing it for, there was no way to get the angle I wanted.So overall, it’s a really decent tripod. But if you want more downward tilt I would consider something else.

    I like the versatility of this product - can be held like a selfie stick, and also extends to make a very-portable tripod.  It's a good compromise if you need something to do both, especially for travel, if you don't need a super-grufty tripod or a super-light selfie stick.  Fits easily into a suitcase and can fit into/onto a backpack.I didn't notice that it comes with a Bluetooth remote, and haven't tried that yet, but it's a nice bonus.Customer service great!  The first unit actually had a looseness problem of the top support, and they quickly sent a replacement that took care of the problem.

    So there are only specific angles you can set to point your phone camera up or down…so if you need just a little more down, you have to go about a quarter of an inch down…you can just lift the extensions up…but the extension heights have a lot of adjustments so you can really get a good height…I use this to video tape my terrible skateboarding skills to improve where I may be doing something wrong…before this I was just leaning my phone against a wall causing damage to my phone…this was a great idea that I can just quickly and effortlessly set this up and start recording.  Phone fits very nicely with just a little bit of room to snap the phone in place…wide legs to make sure it doesn’t tip over.  Very light and compact too…a great addition to my video set.  I would recommend.

    It’s decent. It’s a cheap, Chinese made tripod. Don’t expect anything great but it’ll hold your phone which is hopefully all you’re asking it to do. I bought it to snap photos from my phone, which I will probably use the timer as it’s not overly solid like a more expensive tripod.

    Very slim easy piece to transport and use. Our phones fit securely, remote does it job, zero complaints. Well, we've misplaced the remote a few times; suggest finding a way to secure to the tripod when packing away. We were going to use for a family reunion, then send back (don't judge you've done something similar I bet) but found it was too handy to sent back. Kids used for Christmas card pictures and we used for a crazy family video thing. Very happy with this buy.

    I love this stand. It’s sturdy and I was not expecting it to be honest. It holds cameras and phones. I use it for the gym and family vacations. It is pretty light too

    I wanted the product to record videos of myself playing the electric guitar. The ability to precisely position the supporting mechanism along with the bluetooth remote control are perfect for my needs. Last but not least is the very reasonable price for a quality product.

    Overall a very good tripod for the $. All parts function properly and work as advertised. The smartphone holder works well and fits my iPhone 14 Pro Max perfectly. I use it a couple times a week and so far I’ve not found any issue with it.

    I love this stand I use to watch videos while doing chores, streaming or just holding my phone am even using it now, the grip at the base could of been slimmer for selfie use but it's great, the lock for the tripod leg stand doesn't actually lock when you twist it so it slowly slips down if in windy conditions.

    10 out of 10This tripod is an awesome investment when taking selfies and pics with multiple people. It took this pic and my twin and I love all the pics it took. It was the carefree of the no hassling with holding the phone trying to get the right angle for me!!!

    I was in the look for a tripod for my iphone 15 max pro. This one is perfect. It holds my phone really well not tilting like most others. I can have it standing on floor and using the entire 6ft extender and still not tilting, as my phone is kind of heavy. Recommend

    Remote works. Only has on or off, but what more would one want for the price? If I could change one thing, its that there would be something on the remote indicating indeed the video is turned on or off.  Excellent camera stand & remote & I'd recommend it to anyone.

    I might use this differently than most. I didn't need a selfie stick, I needed longer arms. For my job, I am often around machinery I need to get photos or videos of, but cannot get close to due to safety barriers or equipment placement. This stick allows me to reach with my phone further to get closer photos and videos of the equipment.

    Material is durable, almost full metal base (minus the hinges and more flexible spots required for movement), and metal body.The phone holder itself is secure and trustworthy, easily holding the phone at any angle I move it to, and gripping it strongly even if I attempt to tug on or pull the phone out without releasing the grip.

I have had several different types of phone stands. But this one truly takes the cake for one main reason…… how tall it gets!! Seriously it can go so so tall compared to other tripods. I love that you can make your phone go landscape or portrait. The bottom of the stand lays flat which I prefer because it’s harder to knock the tripod down.It is compact and small. It fits in the average size backpack. It does not fit in my smaller backpacks.The remote is small and has a hole for a key chain. It is responsive and has worked well for me personally.I like that I can turn it to pretty much any angle.It does come with a go pro attachment. I can’t review that because I do not have a go pro.

    The tripod looks well built but handling it like a selfie stick did not really feel like it would work for me, so I returned it.  The return process went smoothly.  My only test before returning was extending the tripod and setting my camera on the attachment to the tripod.  As a tripod, it appeared to work well but I wanted it more for a selfie stick.

    The materials look like they won't deform and will be sturdy for use in my classroom, to record lessons for online usage. The connectors are plastic, but that helps keep the weight of the entire tripod manageable with all the other things one must tote when setting up quick recordings.First delivery never made it to me,  I've been waiting 2 weeks including first order time period to use this!

    This is an excellent case for your new Nintendo Switch. I ordered it the day it was put on Amazon for an amazingly low price, so I did not have high expectations, but I am happily surprised at the high quality of this case.  The case is hard enough to fully protect your Nintendo Switch, yet flexible enough to fit in bags and carry everywhere with you.  The case has nice little rubber handle and zips shut. There is no zipper on the inside of the case.Inside you will find it is lined with a soft microfiber. There is a mesh pocket on the top that goes about 3/4 of the way up and holds a ton of stuff. The bottom of the case has a double sided flap. The top holds 8 cartridges and the bottom is padded to fully protect your Nintendo switch screen. The bottom of the case is form molded to hold your Nintendo Switch perfectly and even has loose fitting elastic on each side to help secure it in place. I originally bought the officially licensed Tough Pouch, but much prefer this one. They are almost identical in size and appear to be made about the same way. The pouch is a fraction thinner and does not have a handle. It has almost the same inside except not as useful. The flap that protects the screen is sewn at the top and does not fully protect the screen on the touch pouch, where this one is on the bottom and fully protects the screen. The Orzly case holds 8 games and accessories and the tough pouch only holds the switch and 5 cartridges.  Another thing I love about this case is that it is simple and black. There is no advertising on it anywhere and no way for thieves to know you are carrying an brand new Video Game Console.Please see photos for more details and please excuse the crappy screen protector I have on the Switch in these pics. The 5th picture shows the Orzly pouch on top and the Tough Pouch on the bottom for size comparison.Highlights:* Holds 8 cartridges or micro SD cards* Large Mesh Pouch can hold all cords, chargers, or an accessory. I even fit 2 entire game cases in the pouch!* Large soft screen protector sewn into case.* Handle for carrying the case.* Lightweight, yet strong and durable.* The Soft, microfiber interior protects your console and controllers from everyday wear and tear, bumps and scrapes.This case is well worth the $25 it retails for and the case I compared it to is currently selling for $40! Only issue I had was that it was sent in a bubble mailer, so the outside box was crushed. This would be a problem if it were a gift, but it did not affect the actual product in any way.

    After spending big bucks on my Granddaughters Nintendo Switch I realized “Holy Cow” I bought nothing to protect it!! She is only 8 and walks around with it and uses it in the car. When I drop my cell phone  I am always glad I have a case! I immediately ordered this one and it’s perfect, a safe place for everything and a sturdy handle for on the go!  Not expensive and she always uses it!

    Overall the product is great. However, one of the complaints I have is that whenever you try to put in the Joy Con Grip in the case, the cause becomes extremely bulky, and it causes me to worry that if ever drop the case that it might crack my switch's screen. Also, obviously you can't put an elite controller in the case which sucks because you either need a separate bag or you have to carry it in your hand. Otherwise the case is EXTREMELY good, the bands that hold the switch is great, the pockets that hold small accessories are amazing (it can hold the charger and extra joy cons), and the zipper & sturdiness of the case is phenomenal. Therefore, I would highly recommend getting this case even if it is on the pricier side.

    When I'm spending the weekend out of town, I use a nice, big carrying case the can hold the whole system set up. That's great for a whole weekend, but when I'm going to be stuck someplace boring for an evening or just a few hours, now I can take what I need to stave off boredom without having to carry everything I own. This case is sturdy enough that I don't have to worry about breaking anything and roomy enough to hold extra controllers, cords, games, or anything else I can't live without. And it still fits in my purse. Great product!

    I use this case for 90% of the instances where I leave the house and take my switch. I don't take it with me on a daily basis but some weeks I'll take it to work at the office for all 5 days. I've also taken it on vacation for a week in Las Vegas.It's rigid enough to protect the items inside but it's got a smooth exterior with no sharp edges so it's not a danger to anything around it. The zipper quality seems fine and I don't have any worries about breakage there. The carrying strap is a nice length such that it's actually practical. For anyone that's concerned about it fitting in the pockets of your pants, it likely won't.The interior has enough space for the console, some game carts and a couple cables (but not the power brick). The lining and materials of the interior are soft and won't scratch the Switch screen. The straps to secure the Switch inside are a nice touch and appear to be durable. There's a good amount of give to the straps but enough tension to safely secure without putting excess pressure on the Switch. I haven't attempted to put a backup set of joy-cons inside so I can't comment on whether the pictures in the product description are accurate or not in regards to that.It's good enough that I'm not shopping for an alternative case in this size.

    If you want a decent hard case for your Switch, look no further. The way it's seperated out is convenient and easy to navigate when transporting mulitple games or controllers. It's also slim enough to fit into my backback when traveling which is a huge bonus.

    Se siente muy resistente por fuera, y es fácil de transportar, casi no ocupa espacio. El único inconveniente es que si traes muy pocas cosas en la malla, probablemente se salgan y hay que abrir con cuidado, pero la switch esta bien protegida y todo se siente de buena calidad.

    Overall, this is a very serviceable case and is capable of carrying everything I would expect for a portable experience with the Nintendo Switch.  The case has a solid-feeling hard rubber black shell with two zippers a molded section for the Switch and attached joycons and an accessories pocket.  The case also has a handy carrying handle on the spine of the shell with a molded rubber grip.The Switch console section of the case also has two elastic bands to hold the console in place when the case is opened.  There's a middle section of the case that covers just the screen area to protect it from damage from anything you might put in the other pocket, and that section doubles as game card storage with small slots for game cards.  However, there is no storage for any extra microSD cards you may carry.  This isn't a huge deal breaker, as you could theoretically put one in a game card slot (the mesh on the slots is fine enough that a microSD card won't fall through).The accessories pocket that sits opposite the console has a mesh and elastic netting which holds the accessories in place.  However, since this mesh covers only about 2/3rds of the pocket area, I have found that how you place your accessories in this pocket will determine whether everything stays in place when you open the case or whether you have to go fishing for things that fall out.  On a plane especially, this is critically important.  That said, I'm able to comfortably fit two extra joycons (with side covers), the side covers for the joycons currently attached to the Switch console and the power adapter provided by Nintendo in the accessories pocket.On the subject of opening the case- since there are no distinctive markings on the outside rubber shell of the case and the case exterior appears symmetrical, it's easy to open the case upside down and accidentally drop accessories out.  My personal solution to this is to always zip the zipper from right to left when closing (since there are two, you can theoretically go any direction you like).  Since I have adopted that as a convention, I always know the case is right-side-up if the handle is in the back, the zipper is closed and the zipper heads are on the left side of the case.  This is a minor annoyance at first; but, once you get familiar with the case design, I imagine everyone will instinctively know the direction the typically zip it on closing.In addition, while it wasn't difficult at all to close the case and zip it with all my accessories inside, I did notice the seam showing when the case was closed.  This seems to be okay and upon initial testing doesn't seem to portend weakness in the construction of the case; but, only time will tell.  I'm a lighter user of the portable mode of the Switch; but, if I find that the seam starts pulling apart later, I'll come back to update my review and let Orzly know of the potential defect.Finally, one other thing to note is that the case smells VERY strongly of plastic when first opened.  Even as an electronics enthusiast who likes the smell of new electronics (hooray for Pavlovian training), the smell is a little overpowering at first.  I left the case open the first day I owned it, since I wasn't travelling and didn't yet need to use it and the smell has mostly dissipated.Pros:- Comfortably fits everything necessary for table-top portable mode play- Console protected from accessories by screen shield- Game storage in screen shield- Molded console pocket and elastic straps hold console firmly in place- Tough feeling shell, seems durable- Comfortable handle for convenient carryingCons:- Accessories pocket not covered enough by mesh to prevent accessories from falling out without being careful about how they are inserted- Symmetric exterior design makes it easy to open the case upside down, making dumping the accessories more of a risk- No storage dedicated to microSD cards (though the game card slots could double as a microSD card slots)- Strong plastic smell for a few hours upon initial opening- Flat black exterior design is functional but not as attractive as some other casesVerdict- all in all, I'm pleased.  The case is inexpensive and so far seems up to the task of holding everything you need to enjoy gaming on the go.  The simple flat black design leaves something to be desired aesthetically; but, the functional interior of the case makes up for this flaw, especially considering the good price.

    I can't compare this case to any others, since this is the only one I've bought for the Switch, but I can say that I'm thoroughly satisfied with this one.Pros:+ No visible markings as to what's inside. Honestly, it looks like I could be carrying a multimeter, or microphone or anything else in there;+ No giant company logo. Actually, upon looking at it, there's no logo at all, anywhere;+ Big pocket up top. I put in a portable generic charger, extra charge cable, cleaning cloth, and the wrist strap things for if you hold the joycons detached. I could fit more but I was more concerned with just keeping the majority of the accessories in one place,+ Hard shell. It's rigid and seems to be water resistant.+ Screen protector/game storage. Great use of space;+ Recessed areas around the joycons so that the triggers aren't putting pressure on the sliding connectors.+ Carry strap. Nice to have, but I can't comment on how long it'll hold up.Cons:- Some kind of ""this side up"" indicator. Maybe some stand-off moulding on the bottom so it sits squarely on a level surface;- Elastic straps are a good idea for the clumsy/inattentive, but will wear out with use and are a pain to get the switch in and out of. Plus I got the joysticks stuck on one taking it out and the rubber on the stick got caught under the ball for a bit. I would have preferred velcro straps.In-between:~ Case is maybe too simple. A small logo in the corner of the top side would help identify the product manufacturer for future purchases as well as tell you which side is up so that you don't need to rely on the elastic bands to keep it from falling out;~ There's a smaller recessed area on the bottom of the case, not sure what it's for quite yet. It doesn't fit the wrist straps, and the vents aren't in that area;~ Not as hard-shell as I would've liked. It's got a bit of squish near the zipper, which means there's a bit of play. Great if you're the type to pack it to the limit, but maybe a little more caution needed when tossing into a backpack. Regardless, under regular conditions it should keep the joysticks from getting stuck in a bent position.EDIT: spelling and grammatical errors

    This case is as advertised - it holds the system with controllers, has a sleeve for physical game cartridges, and has a pouch for some accessories. However, I don't feel that it's a good fit if you will need to charge the system while you're out or traveling. If you are taking this in the car on the way to grandma's house, then it should be just fine. But if you are going to be on a long flight or in the car for several hours and would need to charge it, I wouldn't recommend this case. If I have the charging cable in there, it sticks out to the point where I'd be concerned it would crack the system screen or one of the game cartridges, as well as altering the outside of the case when I close and zip it.Great case for short trips, not so much for traveling or if you need to charge it.

    I'll go over each item individually but let me give you the TL:DR review up top. This is a great product and a bargain considering the price. The travel case, comfort grip, and screen protectors alone make this worth buying. If you're just just starting out with you Switch this is a great jumping off point. I looked a several bundles but a lot of them just looked cheap and poorly made. The moment I saw the packaging I knew that this was higher quality. Now to go over every item:Stylus pen - Super light, not the reason anyone got this. Feels cheap but it's just something that was thrown in, doesn't really matter. It stays in my case and I've used it once or twice, whatever.USB C Cable - Good thing to have but haven't used it all the mach. I'm scared to plug my Switch into anything that not the dock but could be useful if you get a pro controller.Cartridge Case - I have my games in it, it's pretty small and fits in the case. Feels durable, I prefer using it than the game sleeves in the case itself.Portable Headphones - I've used these every time I've played my switch in portable mode. They work well, are very comfortable, good length, and since the switch doesn't allow you to connect bluetooth headphones to it this came in handy because it's the only 3.5mm headphone jack in my home. Don't sleep on this item.Screen protectors - I don't really know how to tell a good from bad screen protector but this one felt like it was good quality. I really appreciated that it was a 2 pack (a lot of these bundles only come with 1) and that it came with instructions, a micro fiber cloth, and 2 alcohol wipes all the tools needed to install.Comfort Grip Case - I couldn't imagine playing the switch on portable mode without this. It's so much more comfortable holding the switch with it. As far as protection I'm sure if it fell on it's back this would help but on the screen the sticks are doing all the work. It's also compact enough to fit in the case. Getting the system out is a little annoying and you can't dock the switch with it on, that might be a problem for some people, doesn't bother me because I assumed you wouldn't be able to anyway.Travel Case - Overall I'm quite satisfied with this case. I use it everyday to store my switch accessories. When my Switch is docked the grip case is in here along with the wrist straps and all smaller items. It'll definitely protect your Switch. My one complaint is that you can't remove the flap with the cartridge slots. When there are no games in the slots I actually like having it there as an extra layer of protection between your screen and the items in the case but when there are cartridges in the slot it can get quite bulky and actually minimizes how many things you can put in the case. Because of it's size and storage capacity it isn't the most compact case so I will eventually purchase a different one for a more on the go needs.

    TLDR: Great bundle and no major complaints. Best part is the grip.I bought this because it's the only bundle that had a ergonomic grip instead of a standard case. I thought the grip would be flimsy but it's actually very durable rubber (doesn't bend easily). The one I got didn't have the saggy rubber issue around the charging port area that other people spoke about. I like that the carry case has indentations to fit the switch with the grip case attached. The screen protector was a bit tedious to install, but it fits perfectly and has no bubbles. A bit pricey, but def worth it.Pros:- The ergonomic grip case is easily the best thing about this bundle. The matte material feels great to hold, and I didn't have an issue with the saggy rubber by the charging port like other people did.- The carry case is durable and sleek looking.- The net on the inside of the case can hold a lot of accessories. It can easily hold an extra pair of joy cons, a charging cable, earphones and still have some room to spare.- The stylus pen came in handy for playing ""Thimbleweed Park"", which is mostly touch based.- The Screen Protectors are great quality.Cons:- The elastic on the net on the inside of the case has too much slack between it and the back of the case, which means occasionally small items from the net can fall out when you open the case. This isn't necessarily a dealbreaker since it can be fixed with a little velco.-Unlike the other Orzly bundles, this one does not include grip caps for the analog sticks.

    The accessories and travel case are nice, but the real standout in the set is the Switch case.  The case makes the Switch more stable when using the stand and the system much more enjoyable to play overall as the grips are more ergonomic. Extended game play is more enjoyable with the grips!

    The case is very well made and I am glad that the additional grip that came with it fits the switch and both fit in the case comfortably. The acessories are hit or miss, but I dont really need the headphones or stylus pen, but they are nice additions.The screen protector fits as expected, but i did have some issues with a bubble on the side. I have had this issue with other tempered glass protectors, so it just may be me.The grip on the switch feels nicely. I do get a little nervous taking it on and off, specifically over the top bumpers, but once it is on it is nice and snug. As other reviewers posted, there is a slight curve of the rubber on the bottom of the switch, but it doesnt really impede gameplay, just a style issue.Overall this was a great purchase and I would reccomend to anyone looking for an affordable accessory pack.

    The comfort case is a must-have. It makes the console feel so much better. The switch has this tiny defect in my opinion: the joycons can feel a bit lose sometimes, which is understandable because they are made to be removed. But still, with the case everything feels so much solid and so comfy in the hands, your hands won't get tired.The screen protector is amazing, nothing can scratch it. And if you are careful you can get 0 bubbles easily.The carrying case is sturdy but easy to carry, you can put a ton of things inside it. Pretty impressed with the quality.The headphones are just regular headphones, nothing crazy, but they are nice.What I wasn't expecting was the pen to be so cool. Is super slim, pretty and it works both in the switch and as a regular pen.The USB charger is perfect for planes, and it was one of the main reasons why i purchased this bundle. The little game holding box is fine. But it seemed a bit of an overkill considering that the case already has pockets, I guess is fine if you only want to carry 2 games.In general, I recommend this bundle a lot. The value is crazy high.

    With all that this comes with, and for the price it's at, this is the best deal out there.PROS: it comes with so much. A plastic game case which holds 4 cartridges, a stylus, some earbuds (I haven't used them yet), as well as a charging cord, and of course, the console case and carrying case. It's all made of good quality (doesn't feel like it's going to fall apart).CONS: The carrying case has a mesh pocket on the inside to hold all the things that come in the case, however, this is oriented upside down when carrying the case by the handle -- the result is that everything falls out of the pocket. It would have been a better design to either have a zipper across the top of the pocket, or just orient the pocket correctly, but still it's only a minor inconvenience as I don't put too much in the pocket to begin with.The plastic console case/shell is pretty good, though it does fit a little tight, and needs to be removed in order to dock the console to the docking station. Again, not a huge inconvenience as I only put the shell on when I take it out of the house, but getting it on and off is a little tedious and I'm a bit wary because it feels like a wrong move could damage some of the joycon buttons.Overall, this whole package is less money than other cases which only come with one simple carrying case. For me, the carrying case plus the shell made it worth it, and all the other throw-ins just add to how great this package is. 10/10 would buy again and recommend to others!

    This carrying case is exactly what you're looking for. It holds all the accessories that I have and it's small enough to fit in my backpack and still keep my switch safe. I did drop it on concrete once already and everything inside was fine, it didn't even scuff the outside material. I'd say it's pretty good quality. BUT I have the new OLED switch and the screen protector this comes with IS NOT for the OLED switch. This screen protector fits the first Gen switch only.

    The orzly switch accessories bundle was certainly a worthwhile bargain, with a few minor faults.First, the case: while not the most compartmentalized and study of cases, the case provided in this bundle is firm, able to store games, the switch (even in the grip), and multiple cables.Next, the screen protectors—by far my favorite part of this bundle. While requiring finesse to install, instructions are clear and you are provided with a cloth, alcohol wipe, a second screen protector, and multiple sets of instructions.Lastly, the add-ons, which add a significant bonus to this already worthwhile bundle: the 2-in-1 stylus pen. While it looks simple, it feels great and works efficiently without smudging and is both a quality pen and stylus for the price.  The headphones, while somewhat uncomfortable and unbalanced in sound, get the job done. Lastly, the usb-c connector and slimline cartridge holder, while not required overall, are great to have.  I, personally, opt to put my most used games in the slimline cartridge holder, and I bring along a power bank compatible with the connector, which has afforded me many extra hours of game time.Overall, this bundle is quite the bargain.Pros:- Good Case- Great Screen Protectors- Good Comfort Grip- Decent Added BonusesCons:- Subpar Earbuds- Comfort Grip Installation DifficultiesI’d say this bundle was a great purchase for my son, and he’s really enjoyed both his switch and this bundle—it’s saved much space and time on many trips!

    Ive been using this kit for the past few months and overall im happy with it despite the few flaws it has.The case itself is durable and the carrying handle is a nice touch. The game card holder holds games nice and snug so i know my games arent going anywhere, and the mesh pocket is a nice touch to hold anything extra. The usb-c cable is a nice touch too.The glass protectors were a huge plus for me as I just bought my switch when I got these.The grip case is really my only issue with this kit, and why I dont give it a 5 star rating. Don’t get me wrong it pops on the switch amazingly and feels really nice to hold but it has a bow effect at the bottom of the case that makes it not so “aesthetically pleasing”. But otherwise it does its job as intended and the switch itself fits nice and snug in the carrying case with the grip on. Keep in mind you can’t dock the switch with it on though.Lastly this kit included a 4 game case and a pen with a touch pad tip on top to use for the switch’s touch pad. I don’t use the pen for the switch but it writes nicely on paoer so hey thats something lol. The game case is nice, its small and the design is interesting so ill end up making use of it for when i want to bring extra games while traveling.I would recommend this carrying case for anyone looking for a starter kit

    The sleeve does not fit the Switch Oled, the screen protector somewhat fits the Oled. The only things that I'm about to use in this kit is the storage case and screen protector. For $35 I could have went to game stop, and/or game exchange and got a really nice storage case and decent screen protector. Lesson learned I guess.

    All items were in the package according to the product description. There were no damaged pieces. My grip case fit perfectly. I know some people had a grip case that was damaged, but mine wasn't. The one piece of equipment that madebthis bundle worth getting, IMO is the grip case. The only thing that could be added to the bundle that would make this totally ""self-sufficient"" would be a plug. I have a million of them lying around but some people might not. Adding the plug now you can charge when you're somewhere with your case & enclosed equipment. Since the power plug that comes with the switch is more of a permanent type, meaning you can't d/c the cord from the plug, having an extra plug, one for your case & then the one for your home set-up makes this bundle equipped for my purposes. I haven't tried the ear plugs yet. I do like the stylus/pen and the extra case to put a few extra game cards in.I would have to say that for the price of this bundle compared to the quality of the items they hit it out of the park & if you're on the fence, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS BUNDLE!!

    Purchased this primarly for the cover and screen protector but thought all the other accessories was good for the price point. The major issue for me is the game card slot is totally offset so I am unable to open the game slot to put in or take out games from the switch. I have to completely take off the cover everytime I want to play a new game. This completely defeats the purpose of the  protective cover if I have to expose the console everytime I want to put in a new game. Also, this affects the ability to extend the rear stand from opening and propping up the switch.  I've tried manipulating the cover to no avail it simply wont line up. Very disapointed.

    If you love your switch & you want to protect it this is a great package deal to get. I got when it was on sale so even better.The carrying case itself is the most well designed case over ever seen very well made its industrial grade I’ve dropped the case on accident from about 5ft & not a dent or scratch or anything on the case...oh & the switch is fine too of course it would be cause on the inside not only do you have 2 little straps that hold your switch in place you also have the game holder in the center of the case which I do not use for game as most of mine are digital but that little middle game holder also acts as a screen protector while stored in the case so none of your gadgets in the pretty big pocket area of the case can mess up your screen. & ontop of that you also get 2 screen protectors which I haven’t used yet cause I already have 1 on my switch so I can’t say much about the screen protectors, & some headphones which seem pretty good still have not used them so can’t say anything about those ether, & there’s the plastic game card case which is nice & then a charge cable also nice & then there’s the pen/stylus which is also very nice it can also be used on your iPhone as well as the switch.

    The seller said in an email that a certain phrase would make them smile, so to brighten their day: ""2-3 words!""All seriousness though, while you can get a leather looking case at gamestop or walmart right off the shelf, this things bloody incredible! Comes with all you want, the glass, game holder, wall plug for any USB (which for road trips or boats, just grab a 12v plug)My biggest gripes are the protective case for the switch itself. The handholds are great , but are a royal pain taking it in and out every time I want to dock it. And the design for the case is too plain. If there were a design or something to say which side is up or the front it would make it easier to not flip the switch or if you're the kind to flip open lids the switch does not hit the table.It wont leave the case if you do that though, the elastic straps hold it in snugly with the case and switch inside so...theres that.Honestly, just for the case and glass you've already saved a ton and the rest is just the sweet icing on a delectable and sweet dessert. I'm happy with it and am debating sewing a patch to the case as it feels like hardened leather, but it's hard foam,  which will make things a little easier :P

    This product is not what I was expecting. I was expecting a poorly, cheaply made product to just tide me over till I eventually get something better.I was totally wrong!Everything in this box was of really good quality, from the case to the accessories. I've heard some people saying the rubber case has problems, but mine fit perfectly and with no defects. It fit totally perfect. Not only that, but it fits perfectly in the outer case, which was also of good quality. In fact, the outer case was as good as; if not, better than the official Nintendo one. The Type C cable was felt very durable, and as somebody who works with all type of electronics daily, I can tell you this was exceptionally well made for the price. I have not put on the screen protector yet, and I don't have any games to see if the game case holds it well, but so far, very good!Oh, by the way, I heard some people complaining about the headphones, well, my headphones came with a mic, and a button to I suppose play/pause. The headphones were also pretty good, though I will use my own, I leave them in the case just in case I need them if I have forgotten mine.10/10 for quality to price!

    I got a Nintendo Switch for Christmas and very quickly realized that I needed a way to carry it around, as well as a better way to hold it when I was using it as a handheld.  I looked at a number of options, but the Orzly bundle seemed to fit what I wanted, without a lot of extras I would never use.  My case has been perfect, and while I thought the method to hold the Switch seemed to simple at first, it works great as a quick way to get your game out and in to the case.  The pen works great too, and the cartridge holder was perfect.The only thing I was less thrilled about was the ""comfort grip"" case for using handheld. While it made it slightly better to hold, I could not put the game into the case with that on, nor was it comfortable for me, as it added extra weight.  This was a personal reaction though, as I have seen others enjoy that well.The screen protectors are great and overall, this was a perfect package for me. I highly recommend it.

    I think this is an awesome value. You receive the essential accessories required for a new Nintendo Switch owner. The travel case is very sturdy, practical, and light in weight. The screen protector can be a little tricky to apply, but if you take your time it's not bad at all. The headphones aren't world-class, but they're comfortable and produce a quality sound for extended use on the Nintendo Switch. I was surprisingly pleased with them. The game cases are a nice touch as well. They'll offer good storage and protection for game cards. The USB-C cable seems to be of good quality, as far as a reliable cable goes.My only significant gripe is the the protective rubber case that covers the console. While it is of good quality and it has a highly comfortable feel in the hands, there is a slight defect that I find pretty annoying.The protective case bows out at the bottom of the console, right near the center (see images). This might not be a major issue for functionality, but it does affect the aesthetics (other reviewers have experienced this as well). When you spend money on a product, you expect 100% quality, and unfortunately Orzly misses the mark here. Some may find it minor, but Orzly doesn't accept a partial payment for their products, so why should the customer accept any compromise on quality (regardless of how marginal it may be)?The defective protective case led me to an overall 3-⭐ rating. I find it a nuisance to have a reminder of this defect every single time I use the console. If I had received a protective case free of defects, this would easily be upgradeable to a 5-⭐ review.

    This is a steal of a deal for the case and screen protectors alone everything else is an added bonus. The case may not be as high of quality as the official ones from Nintendo but it is still constructed well and the material is nice as well. The case is durable enough for me to entrust it to protect the switch from my kids. The screen protector went on easily and looks just as good as the other one I bought previously that cost me $14 for one protector and this comes with two. While it is a pain to take any of the back cases for a switch on and off so you can utilize your docking station this one slides on and off fairly easily and while the rubber feels cheap it does make a huge difference in comfort holding your switch and as an extra was a nice surprise. Along with a usb charging cable so you dont have to use the bulky power cord that came with the switch makes this package a perfect deal to get.

    I needed a travel case and a screen protector for my new Switch, so I bought this bundle. So far, everything has been working perfectly.The tempered glass screen protectors have been great so far. They're nigh-invisible when applied, barely pick up any smudges or dust, are super easy to clean, and don't affect touch controls for as much as I've seen. I accidentally damaged the edge of my first one when I tried to pull it off to readjust, but that was all my bad because I tried to pry it off with my thumbnail. Honestly, that speaks more positively to how solidly the screen protector seals to the screen. I didn't flub my second try, and it looks great - no issues with bubbles or peeling.I know this is something really minor, but I appreciate that the pen's stylus is opposite to the actual pen tip. So many manufacturers think they're being clever by combining the two on the same end, but there have been times when I've accidentally smacked my tablet with the pen tip extended. This is a nice idiot-proof pen/stylus.

    The case in itself comes with a pouch that can hold 8 games plus a travel case for an extra 4, for a total of 12 games on the go.The comfort grip case provides a glove-like fit to the switch and has grips on the bottom for a more comfortable play experience and protectionIt does come with a usb-c charging cable but the charging block is not includedThe Headphones are personally not my cup of tea because I don't like the ""Jellies"" but its there for convenience and quality of lifeIts always nice to have an extra screen protector when the first one breaks then the provided Microfibre, Squeegee, and Alcohol Wipes make the application process a breeze and very forgiving of mistakesalso it comes with a cool stylus for your switch and i hate fingerprints of screens-espeacailly on used for gamesoverall 10/10 product and i will be buying from this company should the need arise.However the carrying case and comfort grip do seem sturdy enough and cant say much about durabilty because i have yet to drop it

    So I was a little nervous seeing all the weird bending cases and faulty things in this kit from other people, But it was the only kit that serious has everything you need to get started. And I have no complaints at all!!Everything and I mean everything in this package was 100% perfect in working condition! I’m even surprised at how much I like the headphones!I also suck at putting on tempered glass screens and for some reason this was just so easy. Everything looks so protected and perfect! And now when I move from my bedroom on the 3rd floor to my living room On the 1st floor, I can take everything in one go with ease! Haha sadly that’s the farthest traveling I’ll be doing :(Anyway! I hope this review helps when deciding to get this. Worst comes to worst and it’s defective you can easily send it back for free? That would suck but I’m glad I took the risk on this.

    This pack comes with a well made case, a comfortable grip, two screen protectors and an assortment of other useful items. I have found all components of the pack to be well made. I would highly recommend this pack. I give the product a four out of five, however, for two reasons. One is that the grip for the switch prevents it from fitting into the dock, and is a pain to get on and off. I find myself not using it because of this, even though I would like to. The second is that the screen protectors are difficult to get on without dust or air bubbles. I followed the steps provided, but still had to dispose of my first protector because it got dust and hair on it after my third attempt to get it on the screen without a bubble. The protectors are stiff, which signals their durability, but this is what makes them difficult to place on the screen.

    I got this pack for my brother for Christmas.  He had just recently gotten a Switch, yet didn't have anything to protect it if he was going to go on any trips.  I remember from our childhood that if he had a handheld like a GameBoy, he'd take it nearly everywhere.I got this for him as it looked like a good starter kit that I wish were around when I first purchased my Switch at release.  Most of what is included was what I hunted up separately back then.  I think the best items are the case with game holders, the screen protectors, and the large handheld grip sleeve.  The other items in the pack, while nice little additions, he barely uses.  He does like the headphones as well!  Worked great on a recent 6 hr train trip.  Not a bad starter bundle for someone looking to protect a Switch in travel.

    Love this product. You get so much for such a great price. Two screen protectors that are easy to put on, the case itself is great size, not too big (not bulky) or too small (no storage space). It is the perfect size. The game cartridge holder is a nice touch. The headphones are not very good but they work and are a nice addition to have on the go in case of emergency. The grip is amazing. It makes gaming in handheld mode fun. The grip has a strange finish on it so the texture is off putting a little bit. Also, if the grip is on the switch it will not fit in the charging dock. Those are two bummers, but all and all it really didn't bother me too much. I would buy this 100 times over again. I have written about 3 reviews on things in my life so this should tell you how great of a product it is.

Everything came in great condition, I was worried from other reviews about the warped grip case but it’s not as bad as it’s made out to be. I easily bent it slightly in the opposite direction and it looks/fits fine, as seen in the pictures/video. The earbuds, stylus, and charger are all in working condition as well. And the carrying case is great, I have more digital games than physical so right now i’m just using the gray game card case but the slots in the carrier are neat too. Overall 10/10 would recommend

    I bought this bundle to take the Switch on vacation, and it really came with everything we needed. The glass protector fit perfectly and was easy to put on, plus it came with a second one just in case something happens to the first one. The comfort grip fits nicely around the Switch and does make it easier to hold, plus I feel more comfortable letting the kids play in handheld. And the Switch fits inside the travel case with the comfort grip attached.The travel case has a pouch that's big enough for an extra pair of Joy Cons, plus all four straps, and the other accessories that came with the bundle (headphones, stylus and charging cord). I wasn't able to fit the Joy Con grip in the pouch, but that doesn't really need to be protected by a travel case.This is the bundle to buy if you're wanting to travel with the Switch.

    The case is great, and some of the accessories are too. The screen protector went on easily and looks great, and the mini case for games is useful.I had to knock off a star for the quality of the headphones and stylus. Though the stylus/pen has some weight to it so as to not feel extremely cheap, I question its usefulness given the Switch screen does not require one. The headphones have OK sound quality, but at least on my pair, they crackle if you move the cable. Slightly disappointing. I have not used the USB cable yet so I can't comment on that. The grip is comfortable but a huge pain to put on/take off.Overall it's not a bad batch of accessories and definitely a good price for what you get.

    Got this for my son and he couldn't be happier.  First, its an incredible value.  The comfort grip case alone is worth the $30.Warning - DO NOT try to put your switch back in the dock with the comfort grip on!  It will destroy your dock!The case is excellent with convenient places for everything while protecting your system.  Honestly with the grip on and your switch strapped into the case, you would have to put effort into damaging your Switch.  If you are just looking for a case to move your Switch, there are better (smaller) solutions than this.  But if you primarily use your Switch in mobile mode, you cant beat this package.  it keeps your stuff together while protecting it and making it easier to play.  Cant ask for more than that!

    I bought this I guess on sale or something for $20 which I recognized is an absolute steal for it. It comes with a lot and everything you need as an accessory for a switch in travel. I like it, the quality I am having no doubts as of yet. I was paranoid of dropping my switch, which has never happened, but w/e.My only critique in desiring a more perfect product is the ability to take off the cover easier, because I worry about the bending of it on controls and weakening them or damaging them over time. It seems to be a bit ""too snug"" when trying to get it off in order to dock it. I love the grip design though it offers. You can't dock with this cover on, but that was not a big factor in my purchase at the time.

    I was originally planning to buy all of these items separately then I found this bundle and opted for it instead. I am very pleased with all of the items that came with this bundle. The case is very, very nice with lots of space inside for pretty much any and all items except the docking station itself. It even came with a little pen you can use on the screen. I would definitely recommend this bundle to any of my friends who have or are getting a Nintendo Switch in the future.The only thing I don't like is that the grips can't stay on the back of the Switch when it's on the docking station because it's too thick. This isn't really anything to do with the item itself though, which is extremely nice and comfortable to use!

    I was looking for a phone wallet case for razor 1 and there were so few choices but i landed on this one since it had good reviews. I ended up buying the razor 2 which orzly didnt have a wallet case for on amazon. So i pulled up the orzly website and they had one so i ordered it. That was when i found out orzly had all sorts of cases for electronics. So i went back to amazon and checked out the orzly store. Just the case instore is usually 40 but this bundle was only 23. I ordered it wednesday it arrived saturday. I closely inspected it and found it to be very good quality and very well made. The tempered glass screen protectors are much appreciated and dont affect the screen sensitivity.

    I like everything about this except the 'net' inside.  When you hold the 'handle', the basket is upside down inside and and doesn't close so everything in it falls out.  I love the durable casing that fits around the switch and the case itself holds the switch steady, otherwise.  I'm happy to have it but I wish that the net inside had a zipper, which I've seen other cases have.  I received all the parts advertised and everything was great, the stylus, the game case, the power cord.

    I would prefer not to explain how it happened but I dropped the remote in the toilet. Sadly, not a clean bowl. Still, I tried to salvage it but it had to be washed. It did not work after that. I got these remotes the next day. They work. Happy about that

    If you're in need of a reliable replacement remote for your Roku TV, look no further. This one not only works perfectly but also eliminates the hassle of complicated setup procedures. Highly recommended for its simplicity and efficiency! I just hit the power button and it turned right on. Gone are the days of following 100 different command prompts on the universal remote.

    I came home from a long trip, and my TCL remote control was no longer working. I assumed the batteries had died, but even replacement batteries couldn't get it working.Roku wanted $20 for 1 remote, which works out to about 4x the price of one of these badboys. They also no longer sell remotes without a built-in microphone. Hey Roku, I don't need a microphone on my remote control. I already have enough gadgets spying on me. I just wanted a cheap replacement that works.This worked perfectly right out of the box. A surprising bonus was a new key on this remote control, which is a shortcut to setting a sleep timer. I also use 3/4 of the channel shortcut keys, so that worked out better than my old remote as well.Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase.

    These remotes are amazing and work great right out of the packaging. The reason it got 4 stars is because there are no instructions that say remotes do not need to be programmed, just add batteries and use. They come with a QR you need to scan but it only works with downloading a third party app, once downloaded and scanned it just gives you the capabilities on how to use a remote, so dumb. But these are ready to go right out of the packaging. Two remotes for this price is not bad.

    Okay first off, the remotes do not contain batteries you will need AAA. Next, I was in a rush to buy these and did not read the description which clearly states they were ONLY for smart TVs. Not the sticks/other attachments. Lastly these do work amazingly with a smart tv I have one luckily or I would’ve needed to return these. They were meant to replace my remotes I lost when moving but for now it only replaced one. So hopefully I find the real Roku remotes for my attachment. Anyway if you are looking for a new smart tv remote I think these are a great idea. They are very responsive and you don’t need to connect them in anyway. It’s an automatic connection. It can be used on any smart tv listed in the description from what I assume. I have a onn Roku tv that I used mine on and it worked great. If you are getting this for some type of attachment it will not work (I tried just in case but it needs physically paired, the correct remote should have a pairing button under the battery cover). I hope this review helps.

    We needed a new remote asap. This one was exactly what we were looking for. Bonus of two for the price of one and an extra bonus, it was delivered right to our front door the same day as we ordered it. I don't know how they did it but we are impressed and happy.

    Worked well right out the box!!  Just need to the purchase batteries! Honestly was a steal only 10$ for two remotes when the name brand one is more expensive for one. Having an extra one works out for my favor, since my dog chewed my remote up in the first place.

    These saved our butts as parents. My daughter is constantly loosing her remotes. Even the link room ones as often as her bed room.  We ordered this 2 pack after hers had been missing weeks at that point.  Both remotes worked perfect after putting battery in them.  I had to do no programming or anything. She has a Roku smart tv.  And the best part was they are exact same as the one that came with it so her glow in the dark silicone remote cases  fit right on no problem.  Oh and soon as they arrived to my home she found her lost one! So we got 3 now for her tv, 1 hidden in my bedroom!

    I have  4’TCL TV and we’ve gone through many remotes due to my dog deciding to use them as chew toys.The remotes work very well with our TVs in our home.just add batteries and your remote is good to go.  Thank goodness for these remotes!

    These remotes work better than the ones that came with the TV’s!! For setup you just put batteries in them and point at the tv as simple as that. I turned around and pointed it in the opposite direction as my tv and it still worked, before I would have to make sure it(remote that came with tv) was pointed directly at the tv. Stop looking around and just buy these! I’ll update review if they stop working

    So, my dog literally ate a remote for one tv, and the remote for the other was missing the power button thanks to a teething toddler. I saw the listing for a pair of Roku remotes for about $10 with good ratings and decided to take a chance. So far, I am glad I did. All I did was put a AAA in each remote and they worked with both my tv's instantly with no programming necessary.  I have a Best Buy house brand tv and a TCL and the remotes both work without fuss. There are a few buttons I have not yet tried, but I assume that since the power, volume, and back buttons are working the others likely due as well.

    I have an older TV with the  remote getting a little weak on sending. This is better than the original; It has a wider field of view and an easier press on the button. It seems much stronger than the last 3 or 4 I have ordered over the years. If it holds up I will be very happy. It also has an extra dedicated button for the sleep timer which will come in handy for me.

    We had ordered a different universal remote for our new smart TV, but it wouldn’t program to connect to our TV (it was supposed to be compatible). Ordered this set of two when I logged in to return the other one. When the new ones arrived, I put batteries in them and hit as button as I was replacing the battery cover….TV came on! No programming required! We especially love the YouTubeTV button that takes us directly there.

    I don't know about anyone else but my kids destroy remotes. They are always losing the battery cover and the remote itself.  This cover is amazing. It allows us to find the remote better and keeps the kids from removing the battery cover. The remote is a slippery sucker and this cover gives us a nice grip.

    I have a short term rental and only use the Roku remotes.  From time to time these remotes go on vacation somewhere and can't be found again.  So I have a few on hand for when I can't find the remotes and they work perfectly!  Highly recommend and I'm sure I will be buying again in the future.  Much better than using the regular TV remote as these identify your TV immediately once the batteries are installed.

    The remotes are great, for the price of 1 you get 2. They don’t come with batteries so if you don’t have them you may want to order them at the same time.

Volume tells you that it's a TV remote.Returned and refunded with no issues.

    These glasses worked great! We bought them to view the eclipse this past October and were so pleased that we decided to buy more for the upcoming April Eclipse. We passed extras out to people in the park last time and want to be able to do it again.

    My husband and I both had great success in viewing the eclipse last October. We all wore them over our regular glasses. I was even able to take a picture with my iPhone with the lense covering the camera.  My dad shared his pair with friends at a rehab facility so they all could view it too. We were all very pleased with how they worked so we’ve saved them to watch the next eclipse. Thank you!

    I didn't order them in time for the eclipse, but I have tested them on the sun at different times of day. I feel comfortable letting my kids use them this April for the eclipse in TX. Happy with my purchase. I may possibly tape some paper on the sides to make sure my younger kids don't try to look out the sides where the glasses arms are, but might not. Just will have to see.

    Excellent solar glasses! I'm so glad I chose to get these. They were the best price point and the coolest design format imo. I was worried they might not be able to protect my eyes well enough or that I might miss some of the viewing but everything turned out perfectly! I couldn't be happier. Thanks again.

    I ordered these glasses for the eclipse in October 2023. They arrived on time and in a nice little box to protect them. They are very sturdy, a decent thickness of cardstock on the frame. Not sure how they would fit on little kids, we used them for adults and teenagers. Overall a very good purchase.

    The Helioclipse glasses are great. The protective film is very dark and your eyes are well protected. Go to your preselected viewing spot, put them on and look up, but don’t walk while wearing. I wish the arm on the frame was a little longer as I put them over my regular glasses! Just be careful the eclipse glasses are secured over your eyewear frame.

    Helped turn my son's first eclipse into an even more spectacular day as we used these, a pinhole viewer, and a cereal box viewer to see the eclipse. Absolutely worth.

    I like SCOTT toilet paper because it typically lasts longer than most other brands. I don't mind it being a bit tougher. I don't use dry paper often. I mostly use wet wipes. But keep dry paper on hand occasionally or for blowing my nose and such.Anyway. This comfort plus goes way too quickly. I tried using less and I still go through it really fast. It feels fluffy like it'll be softer on the sensitive areas, but I found it actually made me more dry and sensitive when I used it.I'll stick to traditional SCOTT toilet paper.

    I never seen the comfort plus brand in my local stores so I decided to try it.  Definitely softer than the original but not as long.

For my home, I recently switched to this product, and I couldn't be happier with how well it works. Each pack has 12 double rolls, so it's a good deal for the money. With every use, the robust and absorbent toilet paper offers a pleasant and efficient cleaning experience. I like that it's septic-safe since it gives me comfort in knowing that there won't be any plumbing problems. Because there are sheets on each roll, they last longer between replacements and are a useful option for those with active schedules.One disadvantage that should be noted is that, although being one-ply, some users-especially those with sensitive skin-might prefer a thicker toilet paper for extra comfort and softness. Although this toilet paper works well, some people might not find it to be as fluffy as they would like. Therefore, you might want to think about other options if thickness is more important to you than efficiency. In spite of this, this toilet paper is still a dependable option for regular usage.

    I have the Worst Mother in law. For years she complained about our toilet paper being cheap. I told her that it wasn't my fault her son could make enough for us to afford better toilet paper! Last week she drove by our house and threw this out her car window. I waited for her to go out of town and threw into her tree and shrubs. There was enough to really ""decorate"" her house. Everyone thinks I did it & I don't care!

    This is not the standard length I’m used to with Scott TP. With that said, it is thicker and softer. Not as good a value.

    This is the exact brand that I always buy so when I saw the price I thought it was great. I understand that I missed where  it stated the number of sheets on each roll, but it was also the exact same packaging so it was a little  misleading

    I'd say this Scott Tissue Paper (Comfort Plus) is very reliable in being both soft & comfortable. It's pretty thick and absorbs well which leads to having to use less tissue paper so it lasts awhile. I accidentally got Regular Scott Tissue earlier this month & there was a huge difference. It was only 1 ply where as this is 2 ply so be sure to not make that mistake. I could've got better tissue at the Dollar Store seriously. It almost ruined me from Scott for good bc I was not expecting that from a name brand tissue but then I saw that this one I usually get says comfort plus & it's a fantastic value for the low price. They are definitely keeping up with their competitors. I would recommend this specific type of Scott Tissue paper only. I would never get the regular "" long lasting"" one again!

    As a caregiver entrusted with the well-being of a loved one, the importance of reliable and comfortable protective gear cannot be overstated. In my caregiving journey for my mom, I've discovered that MedPride Gloves are an indispensable ally, combining thoughtful design with utmost comfort for a seamless caregiving experience.Sensitivity and Dexterity:MedPride understands the unique needs of caregivers, and their gloves prioritize tactile sensitivity without compromising on protection. The gloves' thin yet durable material allows for a gentle touch, enabling me to provide assistance with precision and care. Whether helping with daily tasks or administering medication, the gloves offer a delicate touch that fosters a sense of comfort for both the caregiver and the recipient.Comfortable Fit:Caregiving often involves extended periods of wear, and the last thing one needs is discomfort or irritation. MedPride Medical Gloves feature a snug fit that feels like a second skin, minimizing hand fatigue and allowing caregivers to focus entirely on providing care. It is gentle on sensitive skin, making them ideal for individuals requiring extra care, like elderly parents. I have also never had it rip or had to worry about creating holes and wasting the product. They are very durable.Protection and Hygiene:Caring for a loved one often involves intimate tasks that require a reliable barrier against potential contaminants. MedPride Gloves, made from high-quality materials, provide a protective shield while maintaining a gentle touch. This is particularly crucial in caregiving scenarios where maintaining hygiene is of utmost importance.Affordability:MedPride Medical Gloves strike an excellent balance between quality and affordability. Caregiving often involves various expenses, and these gloves provide a cost-effective solution without compromising on performance. This is the only brand we buy from for caregiving for my mom. This is coming from a more expensive state such as Hawaii.

    We like them and use them for dealing with animal stuff like picking up dog poop and handling dirty things. Would recommend sizing up though, I have pretty small hands and we buy the XL size so 2 people with different sized hands can comfortably use them. They are a bit baggy on my smaller hands but they work well and get the job done. Pretty good quality, they rarely break while using them. Currently at a decent price, especially compared to a few years ago when they went up so high in price.

    Powder-Free Nitrile Exam Gloves, Large, Large (Pack of 100) is perfect for cleaning bathrooms.  I must say they are a little thin and break often- but the price to value is good.  I wanted the powder-free because you really don't know what is in the powder.  For my needs these Nitrile gloves work perfect and fit my hand perfect.  They do not fit a mans had as a LARGE so might want to find something bigger.

    I have purchased several boxes of these so far to use for a medical procedure I have to do for myself on a daily basis.  They work well for the intended use.  These are not very puncture resistant, so keep that in mind if you are purchasing these intending to use with sharp edges or items.  Out of about 300 or so that I have used so far, i had only 2 or 3 that tore while putting them on - and that could have been due to a sharp fingernail edge or something like that.  I have noticed that the thickness can sometimes be inconsistent (a lighter spot where they are more translucent - I do not have the means to actually measure thickness at this scale).  Of the ones that I had tear, none tore at one of these spots.Touch sensitivity is pretty good, I can feel what I need to almost as though I am not wearing gloves.  I also notice purely by chance that I can still operate the touch screen on my Samsung Galaxy S20FE mobile, although the fingerprint detection does not work (which is no surprise).  That touch works at all with these is a welcome surprise.These fit my hands well, without being too tight - I have had large size Nitrile gloves that feel more like small or medium.  Like all powder-free Nitrile gloves, these do not easily go on wet or damp hands.  I have yet to find a Nitrile glove that does.  I keep a container of 'baby powder' on hand for times I need to put them on damp hands - a small sprinkle inside the glove, shake to coat the inside, hands go in just fine.If I had to find an issue with these, it is the issue that every package of these types of gloves has - they tend to stick together in the package.  I often pull out more than I wanted because of them sticking together.  That is such a minor issue, and not one unique to these specific gloves - it is honestly the only thing I can find that is even close to being an issue with these.Would I buy these again?  Been through almost 3 boxes so far, have another unopened waiting for me.  When I open that one, I will order another.  Maybe I should look into case pricing on these given a box doesn't quite last me a month (with no punctures or tears).If you need a reasonably thin Nitrile glove to protect your hands from fluids, these are a good fit.  I would certainly recommend them for that use.  I would also use these for light cooking use, and light cleaning.  I would not use these for heavy duty scrubbing, though.

    When I clean the oven, I use heavy-duty rubber gloves. Nitrile gloves are ok for a spot cleaning in the oven, but not the entire oven. They are great for other types of cleaning, such as the bathroom. And they excel for cooking. If I am making anything with beef or pork, I put these on. You can wash right over the gloves. So let's say I have bought meat at the grocery store and repackage it into meal-sized portions for the freezer. I have chicken, beef, and pork. Just slip these on and when I an done repackaging chicken, I wash my hands with the gloves on and use dish soap. Then I move onto beef, and do the same thing: wash my hands with gloves on and move to pork. When I am done repackaging, I remove the gloves using universal precautions and then toss them into the garbage. Then I wash my hands without the gloves. It makes me feel very safe. When I am cooking messy things, I wear them. You have full range of motion with your fingers, so they are great for mixing meats for meatballs and meatloaf, tuna for fishcakes, or breading pork and chicken. I highly recommend thee gloves for any messy task that does not require heavy duty gloves. Before you order, check the size. Very few people will take small, so make sure the proper size is listed in the description before you check out. Most women will take medium and men will probably take large.

    Disposable gloves are the best thing since sliced bread! I use them for everything! I'm one of those who can stand my hands to be dirty or all gummed up., That's why I can't make biscuits....can't stand that gooey dough on my hands. That's when these gloves come in handy! I use them in the kitchen more than anywhere else. Perfect for mixing meat loaf, breading meats or veggies with flour, handling raw meats, etc. Used them once to transplant a potted plant when  I was in a hurry. Convenient for cleaning house, bathrooms, potties, etc. Great for making Crafts and handling glue.The list is long  These gloves stay on very good and make your chores a little bit easier. I always try to keep an extra box! I have a granddaughter, that she too can't stand for her hands to get dirty. I suspect she will be a ""disposable glove girl"" too!

    We've bought these a couple of times now to use for at-home food handling and cleaning. They're very durable and we haven't had any break or snap on us, even stretched over cut gloves. They're a little short around the wrist so when dumping into a cleaning bucket you may get water inside, but that doesn't bother us and we've probably got big hands anyway. Great value, feels like a more expensive product but in larger quantity for the same price, we'll keep buying these in the future.

    I am allergic to unfiltered tap water so I use nitrile gloves while working with food and cleaning.  These gloves are not 'mil' rated on the box but I bought them in hopes that they would be at least the equivalent of what I've picked up randomly from local stores.  Unfortunately, they are on the thinner side and not what I prefer for protecting my hands from the tap water.  I doubt I will use them for working with food and cleaning because of that, but I can use them while painting since I wouldn't need to wash them first.  It's a good value if you aren't worried about the thickness of the gloves.  I got Size Small and they are sized accurately!  It is a relief to be able to find the Small because in stores, usually only 'one size fits most' or 'medium' is all that is offered, and those are floppy on my hands, lol.  Small IS Small in this brand!  I can't rate the durability because I have only tried them on to test the size and thickness.  But if you're looking for at least 4 mil, these are not it.  If you don't mind a lower mil, these would probably be fine :)

    I have used these gloves for years and years.  I first began to use them when I had to give medicine to my cat, in her ears.  I had need of alot of medical gloves lately and went back to these.  I  like their durability, their comfort and thick/thinness.  However, the last few boxes seem to really stick together.  They always have because the box is small but these ones lately feel like they were put in the box wet.  Sometimes I need to use several pairs and now I have to pull them apart and make sure I can put them on before I start to work.  I cant just pull them out of the box like I used to.  However, they are still very worthwhile since everything else about them is great.  Plus I like the color!!

    I mainly use these nitrile gloves for food prep in the kitchen - handling meat etc. I've also used them for cleaning the bathroom and as an extra layer of defence when cleaning up after my dog in the yard.I have never had one break or rip on me so they seem sturdy enough. That being said, I imagine that anything rough or jagged could tear a hole so it depends what you're doing with them. The nitrile material does a good job of resisting moisture and maintains grip.They are good value for money considering how many you get in a box. The most annoying thing is there is no size chart or guide so I recommend having a look at the pictures for an indication of what a large looks like.

    We like the size and weight of these gloves. Heck, I even like that they are blue. But they are stuck together in the box which makes them a little inconvenient to use. All I can think is maybe they were stored in a warm place or something? They are strong though. None of them have ripped.

    The device itself is nicely constructed, seems like a durable metal housing. I like how it has individual buttons to switch directly to PC 1 2 3. I didn't use the mouse/keyboard USB ports because the display it's connected to has a powered USB hub. No issues with the KVM switching the hub between computers, it just works.I needed displayport video out, so I'm using a USB-powered HDMI to DP adapter, which works perfectly with the KVM. No noticeable video latency, and output is stable for 4K at 60 fps.The USB-C port works great, both charging a laptop and doing KVM.I thought the headphone jack might output audio from HDMI, but it and the microphone are actually on a separate USB sound card that gets switched.

    So i bought the iDock B30 I know how they lump these reviewes together but i am only reviewing iDock B30.Personally i didint care about the cost I needed the function it provides as i work from home from several machines. The function it provides faaaar at weighs the cost.If you are reading this chances are you just want to know does it work and are there any issues. So Yes it works great and yes i found a few issues so far. Obvioulsy no reason to list anything about how well it works you are only interested in the bad.1) On the front of the device they have 2 USB connection that are labeled with visual indicators that 1 is a keyboard input and the other a mouse input. Well for some reason the keyboard input will not recognize my keyboards... they light up but the keyboard taps dont make it to the screen. If i plug the keyboard into the mouse port than it works fine. I have tried with 3 different keyboards and same issue. However the work around is to simply plug the keyboard into the mouse USB port and the mouse into the keyboard USB port. Not a deal breaker by any means.2) If I am working on my desktop and my laptop goes to sleep due to power management policy it causes my keyboard and mouse to disconnect on my desktop even though i am not using that device(laptop). It causes my desktop to beep as if a device was plugged in and i lose mouse and keyboard for 1-2 seconds.Other than that i am happy with my purchase but its only been a little over a week.

    A KVM is a must have item for the home office worker. I don't know why I didn't bother with this for years. It wasn't until my wife complained about only being able to use one of her monitors in a dual ultrawide screen monitor setup that I decided to buy one for her (also an AV Access). She used one monitor for work and one for her home PC, but she missed having dual ultrawide monitors. So I installed a KVM for her.That leads me to this KVM. My wife's setup has her work laptop dock in the mix. That's an extra piece of equipment that I wanted to avoid, so I started researching a KVM + docking station with a USB-C PD port compatible with my work laptop and my desktop. Sure enough AV Access has exactly that! For a little more than the cost of the factory docking station, I could have an integrated KVM. Why didn't I do that before?!

    I bought this to test out relative to the TESmart USB 3.0 HDMI KVM Switch which I also bought, this one's definitely better on a few fronts:1) No issues with mouse lagging. The key reason why I wanted to try this was that I was having issues with mouse input lag on the TESmart when using the Logitech mouse that can switch between 3 devices on plug in mode. There's no issues on this one and I can plug in on the front versus the bag in case I need to swap mouse for whatever reason.2) Automatic audio switch. If I'm playing music on my laptop and outputting it via this hub/KVM, it'll automatically switch back to my laptop if I change between the 3 inputs. This does NOT happen on the TESmart which is very annoying since I just get my music cutoff and I'd have to switch to laptop output manually.3) Docking station support. There's no other KVM that's got both USB C docking support AND KVM switch like this. I can cut down on some wires for a less cluttered work area.

    I bought this to replace what appears to be a discontinued USB C switching solution from Synaptics. What I care the most about is being able to easily switch between three computers for a single monitor, keyboard and mouse.One of the USB 1.1 ports on the switch seems to be broken, so it won’t reliably switch when I switch inputs, which is a pain, but I was able to manage since there are also a pair of USB 3.0 ports.The sound output seemed to be completely broken (and the jack is annoyingly on the front of the device which is ok for headphones but not so great for speakers). When I plugged speakers in, there was a loud static sound and no system sound.The name is misleading in that it only has a SINGLE USB C input. The other two inputs are USB 3.0 (USB A) plus HDMI which means that connecting two MacBooks requires one of them to use a dongle (although I have a few USB-C to USB-A+HDMI dongles lying around so I can live with it).On the plus side, it was cheap and doesn’t require special drivers to be used. I should probably exchange it because of the broken USB 1.1 port (and probably broken audio port), but it works well enough that I’ll live with it broken rather than live without while it’s being replaced.

    I've been searching for solutions for a 3 computer setup, that supported 4K and supported shared devices. The iDock B30 was that solution. I needed a KVM switch that connected a personal desktop PC, a Mac Pro, and a Macbook Pro. It's been great at handling media rich applications and 4K gaming; haven't had any issues whatsoever with it. Switching between computers is straight forward and fairly smooth.

    My old work from home setup involved 2 PCs and three monitor, a keyboard and mouse which I had to change channels on independently to switch between the two PCs, a remote control to change monitor inputs (I'm using a 4K OLED TV as a shared monitor) and HDMI dongles so that Windows doesn't realize the monitor has been disconnected when I switch inputs on the TV (thus, moving around all my windows over to one monitor).  I just discovered this KVM switch and it replaces ALL of that mess and makes it MUCH quicker to change peripherals and OLED from one PC to the other and Windows doesn't mess up my apps.  I wish I had found out about this device back when Covid sent us all to work from home, but better late than never.

    I needed this to setup a two computer, two monitor setup and reduce the back and forth between the two.The KVM works just like it should and give me the ability to switch between computers while using the same peripherals. The ability to also share the monitors gives me flexibility on any headless units I need to hook up to monitors.I wish the refresh rate on 4K was better that 60 but for the price it makes sense why it isnt.All in all it does what it is designed to do with very little footprint.

    So far, this has been a solid KVM. I use it to switch between my home and work PC and it has given me no problems - it just works. The only change I would make is to move most of the USB ports to the back, maybe leave one on the front, to make the cables cleaner.

    Took my time to unplug my existing setup to plug it into this KVM, it does not work, the keyboard and LAN port was the only thing that actually had a light indicating it worked, tried plugging the mouse in multiple ports and it does even light up, for over $200 this does not give confidence at the longevity of this device as this slipped by Quality Control.

    (Update: I've been using this for less than a week, and the keyboard USB port briefly stopped working. My work laptop went to sleep (connected via USB-C). When I woke it back up, the keyboard slot stopped working. The solution seemed to be turning the KVM switch off and then back on. It's a minor annoyance, but I wouldn't have expected that from a $200+ KVM switch.)I've used a few different KVM switches, and they can be rather finicky. This one is plug-and-play with no problems. This can be used to switch between 3 computers, assuming 1 of them is a laptop that connects via USB-C. This ends up being the biggest benefit that I've seen with this KVM. It functions as a laptop dock, which is extremely convenient. This has streamlined my work from home setup substantially. I have my personal desktop connected to the switch and outputting to my dual-monitor setup. My work laptop connects to the KVM via a single USB-C cable (included). The laptop is even powered by the dock.The KVM switch is rather large. It's about half the size of my 15-inch work laptop. I'm not crazy about this, but perhaps it's to be expected given the amount of functionality packed into this thing. One nice thing about the size is that it's big enough that it isn't pulled by the numerous cables that are plugged into the back of it, which was a minor annoyance with the other switches that I've used.The USB data cable that connects the switch to the desktop seems to be proprietary (looks like a modified USB-B connector), which could be a problem if you're hard on your cables. The provided cables seem sturdy enough, but I'm not confident that I could get a new one. The HDMI cables that it comes with aren't super long, so keep that in mind for your particular setup.The only other qualm that I have with this is that it's really expensive. I would only justify the price of this thing if you really need the specific functionality of having a dual-monitor KVM with a laptop dock built in (or if you can just get your work to pay for it 😂).Overall this is really nice and easy to use. As always, I'll update my review if anything changes in the coming months.

    This was very well packed and came with almost everything you'd need to get started with one input / output.  You *will* need more cabling if you plan on having multiple displays and also multiple sets of input. This is standard practice and completely normal.The USB-C output charged my HP Elite Notebook with no issues at all. I had some trouble with the USB-C input connected to this same device, but only after I removed all the cabling / setup to rearrange what input plugged into which switch port. This was working originally. I ended up swapping the USB-C to another windows 11 PC, which worked fine.I was have a USB Mouse and Keyboard which have selectors for three different pairing devices, which ended up working perfectly with this KVM.Ended up using a wired USB keyboard on the front panel to do initial setup until I could get all my devices working on paired Bluetooth. Worth keeping around a wired option!The instructions are adequate to work through this setup. As soon as I get a second display for my output, I plan on testing out the remaining ports for dual display.As others have indicated, given how many input / outputs this device is capable of servicing, cable management can be tricky. I'm old though and remember having to run KVM's with VGA and DVI, so this is a welcome addition to my desktop!As a side note, the sellers reached out to me prior to shipping the product to give me the rundown on how to support 2 x 4K displays at a reasonable refresh rate. Great customer welcoming service!

    Functionally, this works as you want it to. Switches between computers well, no issues with lag, etc. It's also a solid unit - doesn't feel cheap. Where it loses a star is a couple places - no USB-C, and the USB ports are in the front. USB-C is the new standard, so it hurts this doesn't have it. Unless you expect to hot-swap some thumb drives into your KVM, there's no reason to have the USB ports in the front. That said, if you're planning to mount this under your desk or out of sight, then is probably doesn't matter and you're good.

    This is one of the best KVM that I've used.  It has lots of configurations and options and it has pretty good switching speeds.  It can reach high  Hz which means you can get more frames on either device.  This is great to use on non-computers like phones or tablets.Things I love:Easy to setupSturdy ConstructionWorks for more than gamingThings I loved less:Price kinda highIf you are a gamer, you should buy this, there are not many different devices that have the same specs here and if you got here how I got here, then you know that this is defiantly worth grabbing.I recommend this KVM.

    I got this so I could use one monitor for my desktop gaming rig and XBox, and then have my work laptop charging and open on another screen.  It works perfectly for this.  I can play my console or my PC games with the click of a switch, while keeping my laptop charged and immediately see if anything happens when I'm on call.  There's no loss of clarity with the monitors - they work just as well as they did when I had them set up separately.  But this way it's one unified system - it makes it fun to look at game forums or Twitch while I'm playing on the other screen.  No windows on the screen or having to switch tabs - it's all done through the set-up.The instructions are very easy to follow, and suggest several different ways you can set it up.  I knew how I wanted it, but it's interesting to know that there are several other options.  If something happens and I have to start working from home I'm totally ready!I do think this is kind of expensive, but it works flawlessly and saved me the trouble of switching cords on my main monitor (it's a 40"" ultrawide) from the computer to the console.  It runs at 144hz and this switch handles it like it's not even there.  Plus there will never be any wear or issues with plugging and unplugging them all the time.  That doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but computers and monitors are not really designed for that. For that matter, neither are laptops...  I think given all this it's a pretty good value for the price.

    So, this KVM switch, huh? It's decent, with some quirks.The good stuff: It's sturdy, and video quality is solid. The USB 3.0 cables included are a plus. Hotkeys and front buttons work fine, and it fits neatly on my equipment rack.The not-so-good: Switching is a bit slower than my old one, and the audio has its quirks. The audio pops during boot-up, and there's an audio balance issue. The modifier key for switching inputs is too easily changed.Overall, it does the job, but there's room for improvement.

    We have one room that has multiple television, computer and video game setups. We didn't have too many issues until we brought in a pair of augmented reality glasses. We wanted to make a wireless connection from the switch to a receiver close to the seating area. We used our existing HDMI transmitter/receiver. This switch worked with no problems.We'd tried this setup with another switch, and we had volume issues. The KVM switch worked perfectly. We can shoot the signal from our PS5 to the receiver, and it is routed to the gaming monitor as well. This switch has features beyond our needs, but it can still be setup by an amateur with minimal tech knowledge. The construction is very good quality. Nothing on this unit feels cheap. Recommended.

    In regard to a KVM this works perfectly and now I don’t have to switch inputs on my monitor and drag out a second keyboard and mouse to switch between my Mac and my PC.The build quality is excellent and is all metal I also like how the power plug barrel can be screwed in.The included USB 3.0 cables included a substantial and nice and long as is the power cable.A few things to consider when looking at this.1.) There is no USB-C support on this KVM2.) There is no HDMI cable in the box so you will need to have at least one on hand.3.) The USB inputs are on the front of the KVM so if you like a clean look like me you might get annoyed by this.I really wish this had two USB ports on the backside to keep things cleaner but at least with them on the front you get a good mix of ports.

    I got this for my husband to streamline his computer and gaming set up. Not being an AV expert, he found it very easy to set up. He was able to use the include USB type A to Type B cables to connect his computers to the KVM switch, and hook up the two monitors using HDMI cables (not included). The added ports on the front are very convenient for sharing your keyboard, mouse, and any other device you may wish to use such as a headset or camera. The instructions were simple and easy to follow and the images are clear. So far, he is very pleased with this switch because it helped streamline his ""man cave"" and save some room on the entertainment center.

    Good variety of ports, however no USB-C or DP. USB ports are also exclusively on the front of KVM. Easy to hook up to computers and worked flawlessly out of box. Super fast and simple set-up even for those not super familiar with tech. Makes things easier only needing one set of peripherals for your setup that you can readily switch between devices. I am using mine standalone with my computer and connecting my laptop when needed and switching all inputs to control laptop without having to find space to connect and use everything with laptop without having to take out another set of peripherals.

    The switcher works great! All inputs are on the front or the switcher. The power plug has a screw on cable so it can’t be pulled out accidentally. It’s made of a heavy duty metal casing. The box is about 9.25 x 6 inches.  The switcher uses USB 3.0. It’s important to know that with this set you will need 4 more HDMI cables if you already have one cable for each computer. You need 6 cables in all.  No cables come in this version of the switcher. Amazon does sell another more expensive version which includes cables. It’s easy to connect the switcher and the clarity is very good.

    The KVM switch was very easy to setup and use. I can switch between computer using the switch on the KVM or using the keyboard. The keyboard needs to be plugged in to the 1.1 USB port. It also has 3 3.0 USB ports that are shared between the 2 computers. I am using a wireless mouse and keyboard as the KVM is not on my desktop but with keyboard shortcut I have no problem switching between computers. Also I have USB thumb drive in on of the other USB ports. I can copy file to the drive and switch to other computer and access to the files on the thumb drive. This is really going to cut down on the mass of wires. You can also share microphone and speakers. The KVM also switches between the computers in a couple seconds. By using the KVM I reduced the number of monitors from 4 to 2. This will cut down on not only the power needed for the 4 monitors but also the amount heat 4 monitors generate. This is definitely a welcomed accessory to my desktop.

    This KVM switch for AV Access lacks the USB-C and DP video inputs and the LAN connection of my fancier home KVM switch from AV Access which allows a laptop to share displays and peripherals with a desktop, but it allows two desktop computers to share screens and peripherals. Both computers need two HDMI outputs to fully utilize this switch's abilities. Shares peripherals easily: HDD, scanner, audio, keyboards and mice. Allows both hotkey and front button switching while keeping computers awake. A great way to share displays and peripherals between a work and a gaming computer.

    There are an endless variety of KVM switches on the market but the serve the same basic function:  they allow you to operate multiple computers using the same peripherals.  The specifics vary widely, but this is what they're for.  And that's what I use this for--I occasionally have to switch between my desktop or laptop running Ubuntu and a production PC running Windows.  The last thing I want to do is to have to waste time plugging and unplugging everything when I need to switch.  This device makes it extremely simple and fast.  I only need one monitor for this use so the display functionality isn't important to me.  If it is, you might want to find a more powerful switch that can handle it.  For most general uses this one does a great job.  Highly recommended!

    With this switch you can control 2 computers or laptops  while using one mouse or keyboard. Sounds trivial but having 2 sets of mouse and keyboard takes up desk real estate and is clumsy. I frequently use 2 monitors and since my work system is one one browser but I prefer another for personal use, I can have both pc's running with one keyboard to control. Or bring home the work laptop (if you use one) and hook it in while using another desktop.Very helpful for those who bring in laptops for helping others...and more applications.

As someone constantly switching between a gaming PC and laptop for work, having an effortless KVM switch to transition between them is a must. This dual monitor switch has made controlling both systems completely seamless, allowing me to use a 2K display for gaming and work. The included cables made set up easy since all I did was just plug in both PCs into the switch box via USB and HDMI and connected my monitors. Now I can swap between computers instantly with the push of a button or hotkey. For anyone running a multi-PC setup, this switch is indispensable. It allows me to easily share peripherals and displays across separate systems without any sacrifice in speed or performance. Seamless computer-swapping is a productivity game-changer!

    This KVM switch performs very well. It supports two input computers and two output monitors. The monitors can be dedicated to each input computer simultaneously, or you can have two monitors for each computer you switch to. Lots of USB ports for additional peripherals. The power adapter screws into the switch which is great - no more accidentally unplugging the switch by bumping it. And you will need this, because there is no remote physical switch to toggle computers - you either have to program a hot key or press a button on the front of the switch. Comes with power adapter and two short USB cables - I wish they were longer!

    Some quick notes before details:- The HDMI switching is fast and reliable- The power adapter is a bit of a hassle and seems like they could have made that more convenient (internal power?)- Support is lacking- I have 3 PCs connected (MinisForum mini PC, mid-size gaming tower, work laptop)Ok, so my main issue is with the USB setup they have. If I have a wired mouse/keyboard, it'd probably be fine and dandy, but I do not. I have a ""unifying receiver"" from Logitech with both an MX keyboard and Mouse connected to it. The USB ports are giving me problems because I don't think they provide enough power to run this bluetooth connection. At least, I get frequent issues with constant mouse connection though this device. Sometimes it seems worse with specific devices, but is never 100%.Why couldn't it drop the USB 1.1/2.0 dedicated ports in favor of more 3.0 ports? Is it a power issue? That would (hopefully) resolve the problem. As it is right now, there aren't enough ports for me to split these two devices to their own receivers to see if that gives me a better time with reception.ANOTHER USB issue is that my work PC complains about ""too many USB hubs"" when trying to connect an additional hub to this KVM switch to add more ports. Which is weird since the KVM switch I am replacing (IOGEAR) didn't have that issue and I was able to connect devices with my USB 3.0 hub. So I wonder about the way this KVM is set up internally.I would exercise caution with purchasing this device and know what potential issues you may be running into. The USB port setup really is the main problem for me, but it's really noticeable and makes this straddle the line between useful and trash.UPDATE:The USB-C port stopped outputting video randomly. I switched cables to be sure, and still nothing. USB still works OK (I was able to connect an HDMI to a different monitor while staying connected to this KVM switch) but video is just dead. So it's a whole 1/3 usability just basically gone now. I haven't used a LOT of KVM switches, but this has been easily the worst so far.

I've been using this switcher for the past month, switching daily, multiple times, between a Linux box and a Win10 box.  It takes about 3 seconds for the switch to complete, but once it does, there is no lag with keystrokes on the keyboard nor with the mouse.  I have all of my USB peripherals (scanner, printer, web cam, etc.) plugged into a USB 3 powered hub and have that powered hub plugged into the switcher, so all of my peripherals switch over as well.  I am also using HDMI cables for connection to my monitor (which is actually a 32"" TV).  You can see in my lousy video how long it takes to switch over.  The switcher allows you to switch by either pressing a front-facing button on the switcher itself, or by using a key combo on the keyboard.  It is set to TAB+1 and TAB+2 by default, but you can customize that (the included instructions walk you through it).  The instructions are actually pretty good overall and easy to follow.  I can highly recommend this switcher.

    A few things to note:There's only 3 usb ports on this. We'll, 3 USB ports plus one dedicated USB port for your keyboard. If you're like me, and have a lot of usb devices, this may be an issue.If you try to reduce the number of usb ports that you need, by using a wireless keyboard/mouse combo that only needs one port, this KVM will NOT work correctly. You won't be able to move the mouse over to the second monitor; you'll be able to see the monitor, and your computer will recognize the display, but your mouse won't go over there. You must use a keyboard and mouse that use separate USB ports.The hot key switching on this only occasionally works. I usually have to push the button on the actual KVM.When I wake up the computers from being asleep, the 2nd monitor doesn't always come up. I have to switch btwn the 2 computers, via the button on the KVM (because the hot key switching rarely works), to get the 2nd monitor to come up.I'm not the least bit impressed with the image quality on my monitors. I have one monitor that is using HDMI input, and one that is using an HDMI to VGA cable, as it's an older monitor (this KIM'S video outputs are HDMI). The monitor using the HDMI to VGA looks ok, but my new monitor using HDMI looks ""washed out."" I've been playing with the display settings for days now and can't get it to look any better. My monitor looks fine if I bypass the KVM.I'm using this KVM with 2 Dell Thunderbolt docks. I have not tried using it without the docks, as I frequently need to unhook my laptops and use them elsewhere, so there's no way I'm not going to use the docks. I have not tested whether any of my issues could be resolved by not using the Thunderbolts.All in all, the KVM does technically do what it's supposed to do, I just can't say that it does it well. I'm honestly  inbetween giving it 3 or 4 stars.

    I like the colors SO MUCH, they're super retro, and the cream color is *chef's kiss* perfect, and it fits my retro aesthetic perfectly :) Keeps my water icy cold all day, I like that you can collapse the ""straw"" thing, which makes it feel more sanitary than the cups that have the straw sticking straight up at all times. Super easy to clean, it's heavy, but it helps me stay hydrated so yay. I also like the Stanley brand, they can take a beating and still hold up pretty well.

in my opinion the best yet stanley tumbler. ✨ it’s made of recycled fishing nets (my biggest conservation interest), i adore the leak proof flip straw, it keeps my ice for 2 entire days, the 30oz is perfect if you’re petite/have small hands/aren’t very strong, the handle makes it easy to carry around everywhere, it holds ice to the top and a normal sized water bottle perfectly, the color selection is immaculate especially on amazon (i bought a second one in the plum stripe color tonight), and it’s sweat proof. next i think i’ll be purchasing a 64oz in the charcoal or lavender just to have on hand for long trips, beach days, camping, etc.i really can’t imagine a more perfect every day water bottle. the only con for me is they did that collab with starbucks in the beginning of this year and with the goings on in 🇵🇸 🍉 i really did not like that - if you know you know - but making this from the recycled fishing nets is really something im glad to support because saving our oceans and our planet is so important and i wish more big corporations would be willing to participate and do the same. the fishing industry and the nets they litter everywhere are the biggest cause of oceanic pollution, there’s millions of giant fishing vessels 🚢 net sweeping the entire ocean floor at every second of every day killing every animal caught inside including endangered & non target species such as dolphins, sea turtles, & thousands of others. this continuous hacking at our oceans has reduced our coral reef and fish populations along with algae production by 70% in the last 50 years (most of the worlds oxygen comes from algae). their nets are the number ONE source of plastic in our oceans making up 80% of the plastic found at sea (straws only make up 1% for reference). so thank you stanley for doing something helpful to our planet! 🌎 🌊

    Looks exactly like the picture, LEGIT BRAND!Keeps my water cold for hours, sometimes more than a day depending on how cold the water I put in or how much ice I put in. The first bottle I got it had a small scratch, so I sent it back and they sent a free replacement, and it was perfect.I believe the bottle was handled fine, the only reason it had a scratch is because it doesn't come in a box or some type of bag or packaging. It's just the bottle by itself in the Amazon bag, which isn't very protective- especially when hitting all those bumps on the road or shipping to the destination.

    I have owned many water cups but I’ve shunned the Stanley’s because of the hype surrounding them. I ordered this one after a close friend recommended this one because of the hardy top/handle.I LOVE IT. The color is beautiful and bright. The top looks so cute with it.The handle and top are well-made quite sturdy. They are heavier than some of my other types of cups. It is easy to wash and comes apart to wash easily. The straw is a good quality and seems like it will stay nice if I take good care of it.The cup itself keeps my icy drink nice and cold all day. Because I ordered the 30 oz I have to refill it at lunch time.Overall I’m very happy with this cup. It’s easy to carry throughout the day and it keeps my drinks cold.

    Gave it four stars because it DOES leak. But I got it for my baby to carry for her warm water for her formula since she dislikes cold or room temperature. It keeps her water warm for about 9 hours. I like it minus the leaking but it’s not that big of a deal. If you don’t mind the leaking I’d say it’s a pretty great size. Lasts me all day if we are out or visiting family.

    I was a little worried when I bought it since a bunch of comments said that it arrived damaged. But omg, IT ARRIVED PERFECTLY! (almost). It only has microscopic scratches that are so hard to see. The handle arrived a little dirty but I washed it and it came off. I LOVE the rose gold. It’s more like a pale rose! I thought that a little bit of the logo would come off since it happened to certain persons. Over all I give it five stars!  love this ❤️

    One of my all time favorite water bottles! I love the size- the wide mouth makes it easy to put ice in and I love that I'm not refilling it every hour thanks to the 30 oz size. The handle on the top and the straw are both great features. It fits in my cupholder perfectly, is easy to clean, and overall a great product!

    Never tried Stanley until now.  Seriously takes keeping HOT... hot, and keeping COLD... cold.  I bought the large tumbler with straw due to my liking the straw feature however, you can take the straw off and just do the sipping, as with coffee.  Slender bottom allows you to place your mug inside your vehicle cup holder.  Flat base of mug is slippage proof, yet if you knock it hard enough it shall tumble.  I LOVE the fact that it can be cleaned in the Dish Washer.  Many of these Thermos Tumblers tell you NO dishwasher, yet this one comes out sanitized and does not lose it's color. I am a person who will drink half of whatever I have in the Thermos, put it down and come back to it later... sometimes hours later, and I honestly I like having what I left in the Thermos... either warm, or very cold.  When I mean warm, I mean as if I just microwaved it for 30 seconds.  I also love the top handle.  I can put it on my belt, or bike, or cart if needed.  Now I am going to look for the ones less than 30 ounces.  Happy Amazon Day.

    I was curious and bought into the hype.  Firstly, it was time for me to get a brand new container anyway, and wasn't compelled to buy anything for a few years and relied on water bottles instead.  There was all this buzz about the Stanley Cup.  I disregarded it because the style I saw on TikTok or YouTube or news article was the large cup with the large handle and long straw.  I couldn't bring myself to buy that! It looked so embarrassing and pretentious the way people--mostly those that looked like females--were carrying this style.  Looked like a bunch of Karens from all ethnicities, in my opinion.  Then I found one with a top handle, in all black including the Stanley logo.  So, I bought it.  It's simple, clean lines, doesn't stand out as pretentious and goes with my every day minimalist aesthetic.  I am happy with the quality, size and design!  I am glad Stanley offered this size, design and color.

    I am a flight attendant and if you fly with your refillable containers you know that when you reach altitude and open up your bottle to drink in flight the pressure builds up and squirts you. Stanley is made where that NEVER happens. I love that I no longer spray water all over myself when I need a drink! It fits perfectly in my bag and keeps my liquids cold overnight. I love that it doubles as a weapon when exploring on my overnights! lol! It is strong and sturdy and I can carry It anywhere. The only ""bad"" thing about it is the lid sometimes gets really tight. Id rather struggle to get the lid off, than have it fall off. Love this water bottle!

    This is my first Stanley product that I’ve had for roughly 10 minutes & I’m already in love.Before washing I inspected the cup & there are no dents, scratches, chipped paint, etc. Upon the first sip I noticed a huge difference between my Simple Modern & Hydroflask bottles (especially the SM). The Stanley requires minimal effort when drinking & I was shocked at how fast the water flowed through the straw.I was torn between citron, lavender, & grapefruit. I never understood the hype & why people have collections w/ dozens of Stanleys. But after seeing the quality firsthand, plus all the pretty colors they have, I now understand & I’m sure I’ll grab one or two more in the future.

    I was unaware that these Stanley water bottles were such a hot item until my 8 year old twin granddaughters pleaded with me to get them ones. I was going to get them a generic version at half the price when they let me know in no uncertain terms that it had to be a ""Stanley"" with the logo on the side. ""All the kids have one except us"" they said.  While I did not believe that, and I'm a sucker for my granddaughters, I went ahead and purchased two, one for each.These are impressive tumblers, nice looking and good quality.  But are they that much better than the much cheaper generic versions? For me, if they make my granddaughters smile, they're worth it.

    I really like this tumbler!  It keeps everything super cold; it's easy to carry and I love the design and color.Here is where I'm struggling.  I can barely get the lid opened and I also have trouble opening the straw (flip-up straw). The lid, no matter how loose I tighten it gets too tight to open - and the straw is just a beast to open.  Is it me, is there something I can do to make them both easier to open?  I'm so afraid I'm going to break the handle trying to get it opened.  Honestly, I usually have to get my husband to open it.  Anyone else have this problem?  Did I get one that is just difficult?  Should I request a replacement?

    So I decided to get the water bottle after having one of the cups and not being really supersatisfied with how it held Cold and That it could leak but this water bottle is ten out of ten. I absolutely love this color combo of tiger lily and plum. It is a little difficult to open and close the spout But so far this is exactly what I was looking for I should have gone with it initially instead of the cup!! It fits and couple holders too.Which is a huge thing for me. The handle is shockingly comfortable to carry which is convenient because I have arthritis and I can still open and close it well.

    I’m a picky person who refuses to drink water unless it’s in a metal water bottle. I had a 40 oz Stanley with the regular handle and lid, and while it was great, I always spilled it. When I received this one, I filled it and tipped it over on my carpet to see if it’d leak at all. Not a drip came out. It’s amazing because it can easily lay in your bed with your or if it falls, half your water isn’t coming out!It’s also adorable as hell!

    I bought this in the 20oz size for a trip.  I love the handle and love that the bottle itself isn’t too heavy.  I’ve seen reviews complaining about the packaging and I think they took notice because mine came very well packaged.  It was wrapped in bubble wrap and placed in a box with additional air packs, so it was very well protected.  I appreciated the reviews warning about taking the label off carefully so as not to remove part of the “Stanley” painted on.

    Whatever motivates you to drink more water (brand of tumbler/jug, color, size, logo and/or the comfort of the hardware on it that makes it easier to carry) do it! Best money spent yet! 💜 my 40💧! Oh and if you're indecisive as to sizing, there was a $10 difference in between the 30oz and the 40. I easily spend $10 bucks on unnecessary things. Its worth it!! Get it and you won't regret it! 💪🏼

It also hasn’t spit water out of the straw when opening it like others have.

    This is a great travel cup. It's not even like drinking from a straw because of the shape of the mouthpiece. The built in mouth piece is part of the cap so there are no leaks. The bottle is sturdy, but not too heavy. The water inside has no metallic taste like other metal containers. This is my favorite part, I can bring my reverse osmosis water on the go and it tastes perfect.  Plus, a bonus, the color is cute.

    Purchased a rose quartz Stanley tumbler as a gift. Arrived quickly & packed securely. When I opened the box I thought they’d sent the wrong color. It is so pale pink I thought it was off white at first. So I checked the color online & it’s the right one. My grand daughter went absolutely bananas when she opened it. Loves it!! Has charms on it now & takes it with her everywhere she goes. Great purchase!

My only complaint is the screw that holds the handle started to unscrew and at that point the threads became striped meaning I needed to order a new lid. I used the warranty to get a new lid but they only had three color options (grey, Forrest green, and navy). My water bottle doesn’t look as cute as it did but I still get a lot of compliments on it.

    Stanley lives up to their name, not counting all the hype.....I purchased this for my grandson for his water at school.  The ice stays frozen, and the water cold.  This is a perfect size for Elementary school students.  All those plastic ""cute"" water bottles ... the money I wasted on those.... smh....  This one is just right!

    You know this product is as good as it sounds. Really the only reason I bought it is because this version doesn’t have a handle in the side and it’s  cheaper, it was 35$ for 30 oz which is way better than paying 80 plus dollars in stores.It definitely stays for as long as possible and it’s just amazing!

    My husband is always the type to carry a drink with him and he is a receiving manager at a high-end steakhouse and he always likes to have a big cup of something to drink with him in the warehouse and this was perfect. He carries it everywhere. He loves it.

    I was very hesitant to jump on the Stanley trend but this one has the right color way and I like the design of a 30oz tumbler with a straw and sturdy metal handle. This solves a lot of the issues I had with my old school hydroflask bottle. I was a hater before but I will admit when I’m wrong, good job Stanley!

    The unique design of this Stanley gets a lot of compliments. I bought this for work, I’m a Day Care Teacher so I use this daily. Both my coworkers and the kids like the design and color. It’s solid, it gets knocked over a lot yet not a scratch and keeps my water cold for hours.

    I got the 64oz size. I like this because I only have to fill it up once a day and I like that it is dishwasher safe. So far, no leaks and it keeps my water cold. My water tastes fresh all day and therefore helps me drink how much I should in one day. I have heard that Stanley has lead in there products, that makes me uneasy. The water bottle is also pricey-over 50 bucks. I plan to keep using it daily because it is helping me meet my goals.

    My daughter and I enjoy having ice cups and rather than have a pretentious 40 ounce Tumblr. This is the perfect size to fit inside your cupholder and carry with you discreetly rather than looking like you are carrying a giant trashcan around in your hand.😂 also, you cannot go wrong with the colors offered by Stanley for this line! Everything is beautiful!

    I am not the person to jump on a trend. I run a short term rental at my home and a guest left a hydroflask some months ago. Unable to reach them to return it to them I decided I might as well put it to use since I actually needed a good water bottle. I loved how it kept the water but I did not love the weight or the fact that it didn’t fit in the cup holder of my car. One of my students suggested this one with the handle on top to me one day in class when it came up that I was in the market for a new water bottle and I have to say, she did me a solid. This meets all of my needs perfectly (and prettily).

    I do have to say I like the Stanley insulated cup, I tend to call them sippy cups because this is what I gave my son when he was little, not the Stanley but similar cups. It does keep my drink cold and ice cubes in it overnight and into the next day. My husband did buy me the large 40 oz one but I thought it was quite bulky to carry around, I'm not quite sure why people do. So I bought the smaller one. The larger one was very difficult to use while I was driving. It does say it is leak proof but it is only leak proof if the drinking spell is down if the drinking spell is up liquid does pour out the center of it so this one is not totally leak proof. I do like the carrying handle, I like the fact that there is not a straw sticking out of it, I like that I can pull the drinking mechanism flip up and down. I do like the cup but I have to say I'm not quite sure what all of the hype is it is simply an insulated cup I do have other insulated cups that keep my ice and my cup overnight and most of the day. So I'm not sure why people are fighting over them. So I did give it a three star because it doesn't leak if you have the drinking mechanism up so if it tips over while you're driving you will spill your drink all over your car. Also I'm not quite sure what makes this so special than every other cup.

Now I can pinch and zoom with no issues and it doesn't fumble around or come off, until I want it to.It really works and I can't wait for the eclipse. Also, you should try and take pictures of the sun before the eclipse. Now is the time to figure it out, not then.

    Using this, I found it hard to steady / aim this and the camera in opposite hands.  That's not the mfgr / vendor's fault, to be sure.Best images were with this sitting about 6"" or so from the camera lens.  But my own ratio of bad <> good pics was about 6:1.  Again, not their fault, I suppose.Although the instructions state not to use it with your eyes to view the sun directly, I did use it that way, and found image quality a bit better than some disposable eclipse glasses I had for the 2017 event.For the price, I'd buy this again.  Didn't damage mine, so I can use it again in April, as a backup ('eclipse-safe' film lasts about 3yrs, before replacement is recommended).

    The device works as advertised and produced nice images.  However, it does not attach to your cell phone.  You either have to hold it against your phone with one hand, or find a rubber band.  Of course, you then have to find a way to point it to the Sun and avoid eye injury.It works with my 35 mm camera, too, but has to be held in front of the lens with one hand.

    While it filtered the sun for some O.K. pictures, it really couldn't help with most pictures of the sun.  Most of the photos made the sun seem oval-shaped.  I could see sun spots with my eyes through filtered glasses, but I was unable to capture that with my Samsung S23 Ultra.  It is also very difficult to hold this filter in place while taking a picture.  I recommend spending a bit more money for a higher quality filter.

    It does exactly what I expected.  I haven't played with exposure, iso or any other pro mode camera settings yet. You can probably get a better shot if you make adjustments. I just put it over my lens and zoomed in with a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.  Pretty cool.  Your phone definitely matters.  Zoom capabilities are a problem for iPhone users.

    Bottom line is you need an old phone or a very new phone.  My Pixel 4 cannot focus since it uses the cameras to focus.  You need a single-camera phone or an advanced top-of-the-line phone that is smart enough.

    Great for eclipse photo. Taped it to my binoculars on one side and then used a camera attachment to attach my cell phone to the eyepiece and got a great shot in my rehearsal... the eclipse is in 3 days.

    I'm absolutely delighted with this paper! Whether I'm printing reports or flyers, the quality and brightness make everything look top-notch. Plus, the bulk pack means I don't have to worry about running out anytime soon. I wrote the date on the box when we opened our last case and the last one lasted exactly 3 years for our family.  A solid choice for anyone who needs reliable, everyday paper!PROS- Versatile: Works great with all my devices - printer, copier, and fax.- Quality: The smooth 20 lb weight paper ensures even ink distribution and vivid color prints.- Bright and Crisp: The 92 bright white paper makes all my documents look sharp and professional.- Economical: Getting 4000 sheets in one go offers fantastic value for money.CONS- Bulkiness: The whole case is a bit heavy, but that's expected with 4000 sheets!

    I recently purchased the Amazon Basics Multipurpose Copy Printer Paper and I am extremely impressed with the quality. This paper is perfect for all my printing needs, whether it be documents for work, school assignments, or even creative projects at home. The 20 lb weight is just right – sturdy enough to hold up well during printing and handling, but not too thick that it jams my printer. The 92 bright white color is vibrant and really makes my text and images stand out on the page.With 1500 sheets in 3 reams, this pack is an excellent value. I never have to worry about running out of paper in the middle of a project. The paper feeds smoothly through my printer every time, without any issues. I appreciate the consistency and reliability of this product.Not to mention, the price is fantastic for the quality you receive. I have purchased more expensive printer paper in the past that did not perform as well as this Amazon Basics paper. I love that I can trust the Amazon Basics brand to provide high-quality products at affordable prices.Overall, I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase of the Amazon Basics Multipurpose Copy Printer Paper. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable, affordable, and high-quality option for their printing needs. Thank you, Amazon Basics!

    Folks, gather 'round! If you are in the market for some great quality printer / copy paper, you have come to the right place. I've embarked on a Copy Paper Odyssey, and I've just returned from a thrilling adventure with this AmazonBasics Bright Multipurpose Copy Paper! You know you're in for a wild ride when 10 reams of paper show up on your doorstep. lolFirst of all, let me say, this paper is so bright it practically has its own tan lines. Seriously though, this copy paper is as described for brightness and I am very satisfied with it.Let’s talk texture here. Who knew paper could be so velvety smooth? It’s as smooth as a new puppy’s soft tummy. Now that’s smooth.I decided to put this paper through some tests, and wow, did it perform! I printed out my meticulously crafted masterpiece—a recipe for homemade peanut butter dog biscuits. Julia Child would have been so proud.But it's not just about the looks; it's also about the durability. I accidentally spilled my iced tea (the hazards of working from home with two Border Collies and two cats), and I was ready to mourn the loss of my precious dog biscuit recipe. But guess what? The paper didn't flinch! It absorbed that iced tea like a champ, and my doggie biscuit recipe remained unscathed. Crisis averted.Now, let's talk quantity. Ten reams of paper may sound excessive, but trust me, it's a game-changer and you save money by buying a case like this rather than one ream at a time. It comes with a heavy duty box with lid that you can keep your reams of paper in so it basically comes with it’s own storage solution. I enjoy putting my favorite recipes on Google Docs and when I want to cook or bake something, I print out the recipe which is easier than trying to see it on my phone with my poor old eyes. I also use this copy paper in my business and print out orders so I use my printer every day and even though ten reams will last me quite a long time, I like not having to worry about running out.In conclusion, AmazonBasics Bright Multipurpose Copy Paper deserves a standing ovation. It's like having a party in your printer every time you hit that ""Print"" button. It's smooth, bright, and as dependable as a dog’s ball throwing routine. So, if you want to elevate your paper game, grab these 10 reams of printer paper awesomeness and let the good times roll!I have been using copy / printer paper for decades and I have been disappointed with the quality in the past. I took a chance on the Amazon Basics brand thinking because it was called “Basic” it might be lower quality but I was pleasantly surprised, it’s really great paper for the price and the “name”.Five stars, without a doubt!

    This is a decent quality paper to use for printing of documents at a relatively inexpensive cost compared to some papers out there.  I like the paper weight and brightness.  The paper itself has a sort of glossier look to it.  It reminds me of more of paper made for a laser printer than paper made for ink jet printers, but being multi purpose paper, it does work fine with ink jet ink.  Smearing of. ink has never been in issue.  The paper feeds pretty well when printing - on occasion, an extra blank sheet may feed through during printing, though it usually does not mean a page prints half on one sheet and half on another - rather, it just means an extra fully  blank page might show up in the middle of a document if you do not check beforehand.  I have an HP inkjet printer/scanner combination printer.  Where this paper is more problematic than others is if/when I try and feed it through the auto feeder of the scanner.  It will jam alot of the time.  I know that part of that is due to my specific scanner/printer I have now, because my old scanner/printer never had the problems with paper jams this one has always had.  That being said though, if I run say Hammerhill Copy Plus paper through the scanner auto document feeder, the paper jams will definitely be less often than if it was this Amazon multipurpose paper running through the document feeder, which can be downright frustrating to do - to the point I oftentimes will end up scanning the entire document by hand page by page on the scanner glass instead.  If you do a lot of scanning of your printed documents, I would highly recommend you try a single ream of this paper first, to see how it works with your particular scanner before purchasing this paper in bulk, but for just printing, it is a good choice.  And for many people, it probably is fine too, as I do think my printer/scanner is largely responsible for the paper jams I experience with this paper.

    What a good deal! I was tired of storing a ton of paper from another store so I though I’d try this because it ships directly to me and three reams is relatively easy to find a place for.

    We are a sign company that runs a small print division - so we order small batches of paper (unlike full time small format printers.) After the consolidation of the paper mills, it's takes an act of congress and a large order to get paper delivered to your door unless you go through Amazon or similar retailers.They sell this stuff by the pallet too. And guess what? It's so close to the same price they would have to price it by tenths of a cent. So you're basically getting small quantities for a bulk price.In case you were still wondering, this paper prints well. Definitely great for what we need when we're making copies or supplying low cost printing. And that's why they call this line Amazon ""Basics."" If you're looking for premium paper you can get that on Amazon too.

    There's nothing special about this paper. It's just basic everyday multi-use white paper. I use it in my laserjet color printer for printing all kinds of documents. If you're worried about it not being a bigger named brand, don't be. It arrived perfectly intact, all pages were nice and crisp with no blemishes. I took off one star because it didn't have the lowest price of all the options, but the paper itself is just as good as others of the same type weight/brightness.

    TLDR: It's tape with a personality – mostly sticks, sometimes picky. 📦🔍🤔Ah, packing tape – the unsung hero of boxes and parcels. Here's a little saga of my experience with this particular tape, for anyone who's still reading and not already off taping something.Pros:This tape is tape through and through. If you're looking for tape, congratulations, you've found tape.It's got a knack for bonding with sticky and plasticky comrades – a real team player.The dispensers are like ninjas, perfect for those ""I just set it down"" moments and then it's off to the Bermuda Triangle.Small rolls and dispensers are great for modest taping needs – think arts and crafts, not moving day.Once it commits to sticking, it's in for the long haul. Unsticking? That's another adventure. Grab a blade (cool factor optional but recommended).Cons:Cardboard, the tape's arch-nemesis. To win this battle, rub vigorously to create some heat. If you lose, prepare for a tape tantrum in your trash can.""Easy Start""? More like ""Mission Impossible."" Scissors are not your friend here. Trust me, I've got the emotional (and maybe physical) scars to prove it.Small rolls, small victories. If you're packing up a lifetime, these rolls will feel like a sprinter asked to run a marathon.The dispenser's sound could be used in psychological warfare. Large box taping? Consider earplugs.Packing a house with these? Don't. Just don't. It's like bringing a toy shovel to dig a swimming pool.Conclusion:This tape and I, we've had our ups and downs. It's mostly stuck by me, holding things together like a silent, adhesive warrior. It's met most of my tape expectations without too much fuss. But for big jobs? Look elsewhere. This tape's more of a cameo artist than a main character.

    I can't say enough good things about this Scotch packing tape! As someone who ships and receives packages regularly, I need a tape that's reliable and strong. This tape delivers! The 1.88"" width is perfect for sealing boxes of all sizes, and the 22.2 yd length means I don't have to worry about running out mid-package.

    Original review: I was expecting brown packing tape which generally gets used to tape around boxes.  Instead this is just a bunch of transparent tapes, a bit thinner and not nearly as long as the rolls of transparent tape sold by the Post Office.  I guess it is strong enough to encircle a box to close it.  You get a whole bunch of them so I guess it's a good deal, but wastes plastic with the multiple dispensers .  As usual with transparent packing tape, you have to be real careful not to let it snap back onto the reel, it is hard as sin to get it started again with your finger nails.Addendum after 3 months of using - this is Great transparent tape - I'm upping my review to 5 star.  It is definitely strong enough to tape boxes closed.  Being not as wide across as some makes it easier to tape precisely.  But most of all, it RARELY folds back onto the main roll, becoming unusable.  Well not very often, you still have to be careful.  And of course you do have to thread the tape UNDER the little blue tab things which ""catch"" it if the tape is popping backwards.  But this is the first transparent tape I have ever used that works like it's supposed to - you pull it out an inch, start the tape where you want, pull the roll back slowly and carefully, it pulls out nicely if you hold the roll at the right angle, and then when done you just twist your wrist and the blade cuts it off very nicely and precisely.  And lo and behold, the dispenser is ready to use again, with the tape against front side of the dispenser (under the blade part.)  Occasionally it does snap back onto the roll, esp. if I am getting careless and doing it too quickly, but even then I found it somewhat easier to use my fingernail to peel it off that other dispensers (esp the ones sold by the Post Office, those get impossibly stuck almost every time you use them.)  So I am a happy camper with these.

    I love the convenience of being able to purchase products like this in bulk and have them delivered straight to my door.  It's always the things that continuously slip my mind to grab while at the store or that I never seem to have backup of at home when my roll runs out.  Sometimes it's just the simple things in life!At the time of my purchase it was a good value and saved me a little money from what I would have paid in the store.  The product is as expected and arrived packaged well and in new condition.I use this tape for shipping boxes and have had no issues with adhesion as it has always worked great for my needs.  I also like that it is super clear for taping over things that you would still like to be clearly visible.I will purchase again but, luckily for now, I am well stocked!

    We had to pack up our house of 37 years to move closer to family.  We ended up with 225 boxes!!!!  Without this tape I don't know how we would have managed.  It dispenses easily, grips well, and is very strong.  We really went through the tape so you need more tape than you think you do.  This packet does the job!  No regrets...glad we had so many because in all the mess the tape dispensers get misplaced easily so great to have multiple tape dispensers handy.

    A little tough getting the ""bitter end"" (the starting edge of the tape) off the roll at first, but once threaded through the handle guides, does just fine.  SU-PER-IOR to the dollar store tape in that it doesn't tear on its own (often in the middle of the strip) and restick itself back to the spool.  You definitely need scissors or to use the sawtooth blade at the edge of the handle.  Stickiness is good, and transparency perfect.

    From years of experience with packing and shipping, I’ve come to realize that not all tapes are created equal. I’ve had my fair share of frustrations with tapes that wouldn’t stick, tore easily, or simply couldn’t handle the weight of the items I was shipping. When I came across Scotch Heavy Duty Packaging Tape, I was pleasantly surprised at how it made a world of difference in my packing endeavors. This product not only meets but exceeds every expectation for a reliable packaging solution, and here’s why.📦 Exceptional Adhesive Strength: A Bond You Can TrustWhen it comes to packaging, the strength of the adhesive is a key factor. No one wants to receive or send out packages that have come undone in transit. With Scotch Heavy Duty Packaging Tape, that’s a worry of the past. The adhesive on this tape is incredibly strong, bonding instantly to a variety of box types, whether new or recycled. It has a long-lasting stickiness that ensures your packages stay securely closed, even when subjected to the rigors of shipping. Its high-tensile strength prevents stretching and tearing, even when wrapping larger, heavier items.🌟 Optimal Width and Length: Perfectly Sized for Flexibility and EfficiencyThe tape measures 1.88 inches in width and comes in rolls of 22.2 yards. This size is perfect for most packing tasks, from small parcels to large moving boxes. You have enough tape to go around without needing to worry about running out in the middle of your task. Plus, each pack comes with six rolls and a dispenser, making it a long-lasting investment for both personal and business needs.🛠️ Handy Dispenser Included: Effortless Application Every TimeThe Scotch Heavy Duty Packaging Tape comes with a convenient dispenser that makes application a breeze. The dispenser is easy to hold, and the blade is sharp enough for a clean cut but safe enough to avoid any accidental injuries. The dispenser also has a small tab to hold the tape end, preventing it from rolling back onto the roll, thus saving you the hassle of having to find the tape end each time.🍃 Clear and Durable: Visibility and Longevity CombinedOne might not think the transparency of packaging tape is crucial, but I find it quite beneficial. The clear tape allows you to easily read any labels, barcodes, or other information on your packages. In addition, the tape is highly resistant to splitting and abrasion, ensuring your packages look as neat and professional as possible.💲 Cost-Effective: High Quality at a Reasonable PricePrice is often a consideration when purchasing any product, and packaging materials are no exception. I found the Scotch Heavy Duty Packaging Tape to be very reasonably priced, especially considering its high quality and durability. When it comes to ensuring the safe and secure shipment of your packages, this tape offers excellent value for money.👍 Final Thoughts: A Reliable Choice for All Your Packaging NeedsAfter weeks of use, I can wholeheartedly say that the Scotch Heavy Duty Packaging Tape is an excellent product. It has made the usually tedious task of packing and shipping significantly easier and more efficient. The high-strength adhesive, perfect size, durable material, handy dispenser, and reasonable pricing combine to make this tape an all-round winner. It’s a product I trust for all my shipping and packing requirements.In summary, if you’re in the market for reliable, robust, and efficient packaging tape, Scotch Heavy Duty Packaging Tape should be at the top of your list. Its superior quality and functionality make it a must-have for anyone who often finds themselves in the world of packing and shipping. Thank you for reading my review. I hope it aids you in making a well-informed purchase.

    I have tried many other brands of tape and they're always so flimsy and horrible, but for the price this is the highest quality tape I have found and Amazon has a great price on it. It's perfect if you were frequent eBay shipper and seller, making packing your boxes so simple and you don't have to use as much of the tape either because it's very heavy duty. I highly recommend this tape and I suggest that anyone go with this brand over a no name brand because you get what you pay for.

    This tape is the best out there!  So much better than other types meant for shipping or packaging.  I have tried other brands and this one sticks better for longer periods of time.

    I originally ordered this as I needed to ship something back and had no tape on hand to close up the box prior to shipping.  I've since used this on a variety of things and definitely put it to the test.  Where you'd expect it to keep adhesion, it has definitely done the job.  I even used it to reseal a box that had a heavy walking pad in it that needed to be returned.  Not once did I feel the box was going to come apart after I was done.  And none of the tape started coming apart from the box in transit.  After using this tape, you can pat whatever it was and give it the ole ""That's not going anywhere"".  And having a multipack of them is nice, so when I can't find the one I used last time, I just go grab another one lol.

    It's like the superhero of tapes – ridiculously strong, yet surprisingly stealthy. Peeling it off the roll is smoother than a spy movie, and it sticks with the determination of a toddler refusing to let go of a toy. The way it clings to boxes is reminiscent of an overly attached ex, ensuring that nothing, not even a whisper of air, can escape. And if you make the mistake of letting it stick to itself? Ah, the delightful challenge of unpeeling it is a puzzle more complex than a Rubik's Cube. This tape doesn’t just seal packages; it seals my faith in the wonders of adhesive technology.

    I use this tape to secure postage labels onto a heavy paper envelope. The tape is strong and holds down the labels. The metal cutting mechanism makes it easy to cut off the tape. The one downside is finding the beginning of the tape roll when using it for the first time. You have to find the cutoff and peal it off. On more than one occasion I've had a hard time finding it and then peeling it off, wasting some tape in the process.

    (The 22 lb magnetic hooks I bought are no longer listed in the ad.  They are now selling 25 lb hooks instead.  Just something to keep in mind when reading calculations based on the 22 lb hooks I bought &  reviewed below.)  ***************************************************************************Among other things, I'm using these on three steel doors to hold the curtain rods that hold the curtains.  They are quite strong for their size (base is 1/2"" in diameter), and I'm very happy with their (parallel) holding power.  I docked one star for two hooks that don't fit in their base, demoting them to refrigerator magnets.Simply put, a magnet's PULL STRENGTH  measures (in kilograms or pounds) the amount of VERTICAL force  required to PULL the magnet AWAY from the metal surface it is stuck to.  Applying that to these magnetic hooks means that each one, when stuck to a metal CEILING, is rated for a maximum holding power of approximately 22 lbs/10 kg before it will PULL AWAY from the CEILING. (Assuming all CONDITIONS ARE IDEAL.)Take the same magnetic hook and put it on a WALL made of exactly the same material as the ceiling, and it will SLIDE DOWN the wall much easier than it will PULL AWAY from the ceiling (or PULL AWAY from the wall, for that matter).  This is the magnet's PARALLEL HOLD or SHEAR FORCE, and it's not nearly as powerful as its PULL STRENGTH.  This same concept explains why 2 magnets stuck together are easier to separate if you SLIDE them apart than if you try to PULL them apart.Manufacturers are generally referring to  PULL STRENGTH  when stating the holding power of a magnet.  Pull Strength is determined by the MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF WEIGHT A MAGNET HELD WHEN TESTED UNDER IDEAL CONDITIONS.  PARALLEL HOLD/SHEAR FORCE can be reasonably estimated at 10% to 25% of a magnet's PULL STRENGTH.  With that in mind, we'll assume a PARALLEL HOLD of 17% for these magnetic hooks rated at 22 lbs (22lbs X 17% = 3.74 lbs).  Under that assumption, we can expect that each hook (if used on a metal WALL or DOOR) should hold approximately  3 3/4  lbs of weight before it SLIDES DOWN THE WALL.  Obviously, that's much less than its stated pull strength of 22 lbs (the amount of weight it should hold if used on a ceiling).  Because a magnet fails under less weight when used on a wall rather than a ceiling, or holds less weight than stated on packaging or sale ads, does NOT mean that the magnet is flawed or the manufactuer and sellers are deceitful.  The magnet is simply demonstrating, in real life, (and perhaps to the user's dismay), the difference between its PULL STRENGTH (22 lbs in this case) vs its PARALLEL HOLD/Shear Force (approximately 2 1/4 to 5 1/2 lbs = 10% to 25% of 22 lbs).In addition to orientation, there are other factors or conditions that influence a magnet's performance/strength/holding power, SUCH AS:THE MAGNET:  **What is the magnet made of, what type of material?  (ceramic, alloy, rare earth, etc),  **What is the magnet's CONDITION?  (chipped, cracked, scratched, dirty, etc)  **What is its size and shape?  **Is the magnet ""CUPPED"" or not?  Cupped=magnet is placed into a steel 'cup' or 'holder', like the  magnets on these hooks.  Cupping 'focuses' most of the magnet's pull in one direction [the open  end of the cup], giving it more holding strength than it would have without the cup.  **How has the magnet been HANDLED?  Has it been stored correctly (it matters)?  Has it been dropped? (dropping magnet=not good)ENVIRONMENTAL:  **What is the AMBIENT temperature and humidity level?  Is there excess moisture present?  **Will the magnet be completely submerged, used to attract submerged items?  **What is the temperature of the metal the magnet will attach to? - What is the temperature of the magnet?THE METAL:  **What of the metal the magnet attracts or attaches to? - How thick is the metal?  (thicker = better) - What are its components?  **What is the condition of the metal item or surface?  Is it BARE and CLEAN or is it coated, painted, dirty, greasy, rusty? - Is it perfectly FLAT or is it curved or uneven?  Is it perfectly SMOOTH or is it textured, rough, bumpy, dented, chipped?ANYTHING THAT INTERFERES WITH 100% FULL & DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN MAGNET AND METAL DIMINISHES THE MAGNET'S HOLDING POWER.~~~and that's just the short list, there's more, and it ALL matters.I think the physics of magnets and magnetism is fascinating, but technical and complex enough to blow MY  mind right out of the science book!  Fortunately, for most of us 'average consumers', this very BASIC understanding of PULL STRENGTH as it relates to PARALLEL HOLD is likely the most beneficial (and easiest to remember) when choosing a household, craft, hobby or shop magnet for your particular task.  *********************************************************************************NOTE:  IDEAL CONDITIONS for testing a magnet's holding power means the METAL is thick, perfectly smooth and flat, perfectly clean and bare. Same for the MAGNET, it is in PERFECT, new condition.  Ambient conditions [temp, humidity, dust-free, etc] are also PERFECT.  Everything is as perfect as it can be in order to achieve the maximum holding power of the magnet, and that result is what is stated on packaging, in ads, etc.  Our personal-use conditions are not likely to be as perfect as testing conditions.

    These work great on a cruise ship to organize and fan clothing items out for better drying. They are small enough to not take up any space in your luggage. Yet super handy in your stateroom. On Royal Caribbean the walls and the ceiling are metal and these hold on tight.We put a few on the walls to hang sunglasses, hats, etc. Then a few on the ceiling to hold swim suits, t-shirts, or anything else that got wet. This allows the air to circulate around the items and dry them out much faster that hanging them on a wall or door hook.I wasn't sure if these would hold well given their small size. They do! Especially when used on the ceiling. They are tough to pull off. When used on the wall, they hold much less weight as they tend to slide down the wall if much more weight that a hat or light purse. All in all, a great buy.

    These are pretty small. You won’t hook cooking utensils on them unless the handles are very thin at the end with the holes. They have Avery strong magnet for their size. I wanted to attach a fly swatter to the side of my fridge so it is perfect. Also worked well for hanging up dish towels.

    I purchased these to take on a cruise. Looking at the picture they looked so much bigger. The amount of weight they hold was fantastic.So I'm not saying it's a bad product as it is a very strong magnet.  So that is why I gave it a 5 star.What I'm saying is it's way too small to use to hang a shirt so if your looking for this to pack for your cruise these are too small. The picture is misleading.

    I was surprised at how much smaller these hooks are than the actual photo. The size is actually about 1/2 - 1/3 of the photon size. I use them on the metal surface of the hot water heater in the garage to hang items like hats, small extension cords, and other commonly used items that I keep misplacing grrr.....%^&^**.No way this thing will hold 22 lbs.But for $8, I will keep them.

    This is a follow up to my 1st review.  If you put on the fridge or filing cabinet with the hook sticking out, only small items. To get max weight load,  must hang where the hook is hanging down. Went to another site to find this out.

    We recently took these 2lb magnetic hooks on our cruise, and they were an absolute game-changer for keeping our cabin organized and clutter-free.

    Great product works well for a household but if you are going on vacation and you’re thinking about buying this for a cruise, it’s not going to be heavy enough but if you want to use them around the house I absolutely recommended.

    I needed some hooks to hang miscellaneous items here and there. These work! Strong magnet keeps things in place. The hook is small, so it limits what can be hung on it. Overall good, but I'll get larger hooks next time.

    2nd purchase.  This one being a larger size. Very well made magnet  But I ordered larger because I needed a larger hook. The magnet part is larger.  Not the hook  Will keep on looking.  Too bad though. It really is a nice Looking magnet.  I bought black matte

    We used these to hold up a clothesline onboard our ship. We were able to dry several loads of laundry this way. We’ll use them in the future for camping.

    The magnet is strong and removable. I am using these on a 3-tier metal rolling cart to organize my craft supplies.  I hang some items off the cart sides from these. It actually works better than I expected.

    I bought these for a cruise and to use at home. The metal walls and ceiling of the cruise ship allow use of these magnets. These are good for the ceiling but have a tendency to slide down the wall if your hanging a shirt or trousers. I suggest a stronger magnet for vertical walls.

    These magnets are super strong.  Surprisingly strong for such a small magnet. If you need super strong magnetic hooks definitely get these. I was originally going to use it for dish towels but I probably can hang some pots off of these things

    It was sturdy, but it did not hold much weight.  I used a couple in the cruise ship cabin for lite things like lanyards.  Tried to hang a bathrobe, maybe 2 lbs, and it slid down the wall.

    We are using these on a cruise to hold our swim suits, towels, etc. They are perfect for that. I also used them in my classroom to hang vines around the room. I don't put too much weight on them, but I have never had to reposition them or take anything off because they couldn't handle it.

    These are very small hooks. Small magnet too. They only work if you are going to hang something from a metal shelf or other horizontal surface. If you try to hang them on  a vertical surface such as a wall, it takes about a pound to make them slide down. They slide fairly easily on horizontal surfaces but as long as your weight is going to hang straight down they work.

    I bought this in 2017. It is now 2020. I am still using it. It still works as well as the day I got it.Left button still clicks. Right button still clicks. Scroll wheel still scrolls. Side buttons still work. Except in some situations, namely certain games that I'm pretty sure don't accept extra mouse button inputs anyway. For example, in Deus Ex Human Revolution, Bioshock, and Starcraft 2 they don't work, but in Fallout: New Vegas, Metro 2033, and Dota 2 they work perfectly. Seems more a problem with the games themselves than with the mouse. Regardless, their primary function, to go forward and backward on most web pages, still works fine. I use it regularly- Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, even gaming apps like Steam, Origin, Battlenet, and Gog- it's a great unexpected utility. It's easy not to click them if you don't want to unless you have fat thumbs or a lack of muscle control; luckily I have neither but YMMV. It's a hardy piece of hardware. In the games I mentioned above, you need to do a lot of clicking. A lot. Honestly I've clicked it so many times that sometimes my fingers get tired (especially in RTS/Moba which take a LOT of clicking) but the mouse still clicks. It's been three years, I must have clicked hundreds of thousands of times if not millions, and it Still. Keeps. Clicking. Granted I keep it clean and pristine and don't let it get gummed up with cheeto dust or bbq seasoning but it should go without saying that you take care of your electronics or they don't work as well later.The weight and the DPI adjustments are functional, I just don't use them. I removed the weights because they bothered me bu hey they're removable so no harm no foul. Some certain games with messed up mouse acceleration or weird sensitivity input (looking at you, Dead Space) do require a DPI adjustment. There's only 3 tiers which is meh but it's better than none or having 3 million tiers. The lasers are incredibly functional on a variety of surfaces and the material is smooth enough that many surfaces can be used well. Mattress, mousepad, desk, a pair of jeans, I'm honestly shocked how well it works on different materials. The cord has frayed slightly over the years but that's mostly because in my setup, the cord wraps around my external speakers to plug into my computer, and it seems to have only frayed where it rubs up against the speaker. Even then, only a few strands pop out, and the cord itself is still in great condition. The black and red color palette is inoffensive and helps to see where it is in the dark. And the design overall is pretty sleek and cool. My hand is perfectly sized for the hardware so if your hand is the size of my hand (I have hands of fairly average size) you won't have an issue. I can't speak on battery life because it has a cable.Essentially this is baby's first gaming mouse. It's pretty much right in the middle between a practical one typically used for web browsing etc, and a pure gaming one which, well, is used primarily for playing video games. It's enough that I can use it for both activities without encountering any problems. I have to use it in the correct USB slot or I'll encounter problems, but that shouldn't come as a shock to anybody who knows basic electronics. I trust Redragon brand enough that when I buy a keyboard and replacement mouse (if this one ever breaks) it'll be them. Thanks for three years of a good mouse Redragon; here's to three more.

    Like most products from Redragon, this mouse ticks all the boxes when it comes to features, usability and comfort!The comfort of this mouse is very good! It's large enough to fit in the hand without being too large and has enough weight without being too heavy.The sensor is very precise and the DPI selection is on par with what one would expect from a higher priced model from another manufacturer.The RGB aspect is varied enough to be fun and customizable enough to satisfy anyone's needs. If you don't want any lighting, there is an easy option to turn the lights off, and of course the mouse remembers your setting selection when power cycled or unplugged.The button selection is excellent and the button clicks are solid as usual.As this is a wired mouse, one can expect the usual quality cloth braided cable to be long and flexible.Over all, an excellent offering from Redragon! Whether you are looking for a mouse for gaming or for desktop use, you will not be disappointed with this Ranger model!

    ***UPDATE on 5/24/2015***After having had this mouse for some time, I'd like to elaborate on some of the points I made about the mouse.First, the weight of the mouse.  Now that I have gotten used to this mouse, the weight is perfect.  Remember, I was coming from a very heavy R.A.T. 7 mouse that made me feel a bit shocked by how light this one is.  This mouse feels great and, not that the mouse is the ONLY reason, but I did manage to get from Silver Elite Master to DMG on CS:GO playing with this mouse and will not doubt hit The Global Elite down the road a bit.  The mouse is very ""grippy"" in my hands and this is very important, for instance, when you are zoomed in with a sniper rifle awaiting an enemy coming into your view from around a door or corner.  Using more of a claw grip in these instances allows me a ridiculous amount of control over my crosshair movement (in other words, I can accurately move the mouse just a sliver in any given direction).  A big part of this is probably due to the quality of the laser mouse in combination with my sensitivity settings (which for CS:GO are: 1.5 sensitivity, 0.80 scoped in sensitivity, Raw Input = on, and my Windows sensitivity is on the middle tick mark with acceleration off).The buttons have held up superbly.  They are still very responsive, especially with their ""clicky"" feedback.  Of special note is the mouse wheel.  The rubber ""tire"" like covering on it works great and the down-click motion is direct and not sloppy.  You know how some mouses, when you try to click the middle-mouse button, cause you to slip off the wheel or not be able to click it effortlessly?  I haven't ran into that issue yet with this mouse.Still happy with this purchase and I really cannot find a reason NOT to give it 5 stars.  It looks cool, functions great, and has had very little issues.With that said, I am giving it 4 stars due to a driver issue and computer sleep mode issue.  Whenever I put my computer to sleep and then wake it back up, I have to unplug and then re-plug the mouse to get Windows to recognize it.  I Googled this issue and nothing that would indicate it being anything else but this mouse.  My other mice don't have that issue and neither do my other USB devices.Also, I downloaded a driver/software for this mouse from the manufacturer's web site (if I recall correctly) and this caused my mouse to randomly click every few minutes.  During a match in CS:GO, you could imagine how this could really mess things up (sniping, defusing a bomb, maintaining stealth, having a grenade out).  After uninstalling the software, the mouse went back to normal.GET THIS MOUSE!  It really is an amazing value and I'd pay more than I did for it.  I got this for about $17 with Prime shipping.  I would easily have paid $25-30 knowing what I do now.***END UPDATE***Appearance:This mouse looks great, in my opinion.  It has a very aggressive look, and the pairing of a red and black color scheme is a nice touch.  The color LEDs appear on the back of the mouse and both sides which add a very coll effect.  Additionally, the side thumb buttons and the thumb rest are textured and/or slotted for design and grip.  SCORE: 9/10 for appearance.Build quality:So far, the mouse is holding up well.  There is a non-rubberized coating that is more like a matte finish on the main body of the mouse.  This seems to be slip resistant and helps with grip.  The buttons are very ""clicky"" which is great.  I play CS:GO a lot, and I had an issue with my R.A.T. 7 where it felt as if some of the buttons were a bit mushy.  I immediately noticed the difference with the buttons of this mouse and love the switches that the buttons use.  The mouse, overall, feels like it will hold up structurally for some time, and all of the pieces look well-finished and put together.  The braided cable tells me they went the extra mile to make sure this mouse delivers.  SCORE: 9/10Feel:This is the big category for me.  The mouse feels very light, even with the weights inserted into the chassis.  It feels light enough that I almost wish it were just a tad bit heavier, but this could merely be just personal preference.  One other complain I have is the feel of the thumb rest.  It is a piece of textured plastic (which seems like good quality nonetheless).  My gripe is that it would be nice to have something a little ""grippier"" or ""rubbery"" there to make my thumb feel a little more like part of the mouse.  Although, I must say that I enjoy the slotted thumb rest and it seems to help with keeping my hand/thumb cooler.The buttons feel great and responsive.  Not spongy at all.  I love the crisp ""click"" that this mouse has on all of the buttons.  There is only one button to change the sensitivity, so it would have been nice to have another one to change it the opposite way.  In CS:GO, I like to down my sensitivity depending on what weapon I am using, and it can be tedious to have to click 3 times on one button to cycle the sensitivity back to my original one.  The mouse wheel is extra wide which is amazing.  The rubber grip on it ensures that you don't slip when using the scroll wheel.Lastly, this mouse's light weight feeling also gives it a feeling of being ""cheap.""  I do not look at this mouse as being cheap at all, but more like a very good value for what you get.  With that said, maybe it is just me and a heavier weighted mouse would make that feeling go away.  The low weight, however, makes it every easy to move the mouse a tiny distance on screen.  Which leads me to the mouse feet.  My R.A.T. 7 felt like it would jump around a bit when I would try to move my crosshair a tiny distance.  I think this was a combination of the mouse feet and the wide, wide design of the mouse.  This mouse has NO issue with tiny movements and I feel like I can manipulate the mouse very easily and securely.  SCORE: 9/10Value:Cannot beat the value.  I paid 17.00 with overnight Prime shipping for a 6-button, braided cable, laser mouse with adjustable sensitivity and awesome button switches.  I cannot find a good reason to use my other mice over this one.  SCORE: 10/10Overall Score: 9.25/10I would highly recommend this to anyone.  The price is low enough that you have no reason to have it, even as a backup mouse.  Some mice are good for certain things, so if you find that you don't need your ultra-hyped, overrated $75 mouse, give this one a try.  I would buy it again and will now look at Redragon's other products (such as their keyboards).

    The Redragon M601 is a mouse for the casual, penny-saving gamer. It has a unique design, is made of sturdy material, and has a decent amount of adjustability, all the while brandishing a price of lower than $15. There are very few alternatives out there that you could find that include all of the features of the M601 at such a low cost.Design and ComfortAside from the cost, the design and comfort of the M601 was the main selling point of the product. The design of the M601 is rather unique in that, instead of having rounded edges all around the mouse, it has pointed edges at the front which gives it the look of a dragon's claw. This coupled with the glowing Redragon icon at the base of the mouse gives the whole thing a sense of fantasy created around the Redragon name. But the design is used for more than just creating a fantasy around the product. The pointed edges towards the front of the mouse are slightly raised up on the sides which creates an indent in the middle of the mouse buttons where your fingers can rest comfortably. The edges are used as a way to guide your fingers into the middle of the left and right mouse buttons which makes it easy and comfortable for your fingers to rest and click on the middle of the buttons where it is easiest to get a response. Overall, the design of the mouse creates the experience of guiding a dragon's claw while simultaneously creating a comfortable mouse to rest your hands on.DurabilityAfter just over six months of continual use, there has been no noticeable degradation in my M601. The M601 is made of very sturdy materials and has a tight constitution meaning that there are no loose parts or buttons flopping around when the mouse gets moved from one place to another. Each click of the mouse is distinct and responsive. The cord is about 6 feet long and braided the whole way.PerformanceThe actual performance of the mouse is solid. The changeable DPI button works perfectly with its three adjustable setting. The two side buttons work as intended and the mouse's optical sensor is very responsive. The only stumble in performance that has been shown is this weird bug where if the computer is ever put to sleep then started back up again, the mouse will not work. The simple solution to this problem is just simply to unplug and plug back in mouse. This bug does not happen if you shut down or restart the computer, it only ever happens when the computer is put to sleep. It is a simple problem with an easy solution.Overall, this mouse is great for a casual gamer. It gives the perks of high end costing mice, like the adjustable DPI and durable construction, while also holding the cost of a low end mouse. If you are a casual gamer looking for a new, adjustable mouse while also looking to keep your wallet intact, this is the mouse you are looking for.

    You don't really appreciate something as simple as a product working the way it should and working incredibly well until you get a bad product. I originally bought a black with blue lights gaming mouse from another maker that had over 1500 reviews with a 4-star rating for a few dollars cheaper and I absolutely regretted it. That other brand was the Tecknet M268 black mouse with blue lighting didn't feel at all right in my hand. The plastic had no real texture to it and actually felt cheap and somewhat thin and brittle. Worst part was the cursor tracking. Trying to click on the X of a web page or a window was a nightmare. The cursor was jumpy and unstable and playing games on a 2560x1440 resolution screen where everything you needed to click on was tiny was impossible. I tried using different mouse pads and surfaces and nothing made it better. I had to return that and I'm glad I did.My new Redragon Centrophorus is the complete opposite of the other brand's. Here are the points of the Redragon I find superior to the other mouse:- The feel is just right. The weights inside this mouse gave it a nice heavier quality feel and movement of more expensive mice I own.- All the buttons have a nice if not perfectly satisfying resistance and ""click."" Even the wheel button feels good and solid when I press on it. The other mouse's buttons actually felt clunky and somewhat hollow sounding.- The cord wrapped in red and black braided fiber adds a nice touch which also looks and feels great compared to the other one. I didn't realize there was a difference between braided cords until I felt the 2 side-by-side.- The red light inside slowly pulses illuminating the all the crevises, windows, and logo is just beautiful. The other one was just a dim blue light that was always on.- The center button to change the DPI actually makes a difference when I press it. The first level makes the cursor move slow and the 4th level makes it zip across the screen with barely a flick of the wrist. My favorite and most used it the second level.- It comes in a reusable plastic storage box with a form fitted clear plastic inner packaging shell and a locking lid that snaps closed on all four sides. The box even has the logo imprinted onto the lid. The other one came in a small thin brown cardboard box I've already tossed in the recycle bin (I hope it's recyclable!)- Best of all and most important in my opinion is the incredibly smooth, accurate, and precise tracking ability of the mouse cursor. It seems to just glide across the screen and gives me absolute control of where I want it to go and lands dead-on to what I need to click. It actually has more control than all of my 50 dollar plus Logitech mice. No exaggerating! I think it might be due to the driver and software I downloaded for the Redragon, but it was worth it. This is one point that I'm sure anyone will agree on. If a mouse can't give you precise control and do what it's supposed to besides looking good then it's a waste of money no matter how little you spend on it.Overall, for only literally a few dollars more, this mouse has surprisingly exceeded all of my expectations and is an absolute pleasure to use. I noticed my PC gaming had improved due to not missing any of the buttons anymore or taking extra time and effort to correctly position the cursor where I need it to be. I always thought great gaming mice had to be expensive, but Redragon really changed my views about that. You won't be disappointed with this one.

    AFTER ONE YEAR: This mouse is still great for the price. I've had two within the past year, but I honestly can't blame the manufacturers. This mouse can take some ABUSE! My cats push it off the table onto the wood floor every day, multiple times a day. They've chewed on the cord, they've ripped it out of the USB port... anything you can think of. I eventually ran into disconnecting issues with the first mouse, but like I said it took abuse. My ""new"" 6 month old mouse is still going strong. My boyfriend coincidentally has the same mouse, and he's had it for about a year and a half with no issues.For the price, I really can't complain about this mouse. It has a nice textured feel to it, the USB connector fits well in my USB port, the cord is high quality braided nylon. The color scheme is good, gamers love our edgy red LED lights. It's bright, so you might need to unplug it at night.KEEP IN MIND, for those of you buying your first gaming mouse or looking for a present: 6 buttons means the left click, the right click, the center scroll wheel, 2 side buttons, and the DPI button. Mouses advertised as 6 buttons only have 4 that you can use (5 if you count the scroll wheel).PROS:-Good price-Textured grip, so even sweaty hands won't drop it-High quality braided nylon cord, colored black and red to match the mouse-Edgy color scheme (the red LEDs are nice and bright, you might need to unplug it at night)-Plug and play-no customization of the software required-Customizable weights, which I was unable to try on this mouse but is a good feature nonetheless (more on this in the cons section)-Good size- bigger than a ""regular"" mouse but not too big for my hands, which I have run into before.-Works perfectly on random surfaces-I usually play on my bed or on the couch and I have yet to need a mousepad.CONS:-Long cord- like, way too long. I could sit 6 feet away from my computer and still use this mouse. It's annoying and it gets in the way. Plus I'm sure over time it will start to kink and cause issues.-The cover that holds in the weights just fell off after a day of use before I was able to mess with them, and now I can't find it or the weights. The mouse works well without them though, although it will feel light if you are used to weights.Overall, this seems like a good mouse for the casual gamer. The last mouse I bought of similar price (an AZIO) only lasted a couple months, though, so time will tell if this mouse will be more durable than that one. If I have issues I will be sure to update the review accordingly.

    Alright, I am going to do my best with this review here.For starters I want to start off with what I love about this mouse. Oh my gosh where to start. The mouse I used previous to this Redragon was a Microsoft Mobile 3500 model, which is a small wireless mouse that I used for the past year. The 3500 mobil model is great for travel and bringing to class when I am on my college campus, but not great for everything. So I decided to get another mouse that might be better for my gaming and more at home use. I saw this mouse and thought that for 14 dollars I can try out this highly rated game mouse and loved it. I play games often so this mouse has started improving everything I do in that sense. It has great response time and I love that is has customizable side buttons that I can bind in game. Its also nice to have a button that changes the mouse dpi setting with just one click. Its nice if you prefer your mouse more sensitive in game and less sensitive out of it (like I do. I like having it at 2000 dpi in game and 1600 outside). On top of that I think it looks really cool. Overall I love almost everything about it.Almost everything. There is one issue I run into and I know I am not alone. It has to do with the driver/mouse. When I first was trying this mouse out I was excited to bind the buttons on the side to commands for the game I play most (tf2). When I got in the game and tried to bind the buttons they did not respond and instead they both registered as m3 instead of m4 or m5. I was very confused and so I did some looking around online on how to fix that, because I thought that the software that I got from the official website (www.redragonzone.com) would take care of that. Turns out that every time you restart the computer you need to open the set-up and repair the driver. It doesn't take long (less time than checking my e-mail everyday) and you only have to do that repair after your comp shut's down and starts back up again. To me its not a big issue and I am just fine with it, but if that would bug you than this is not the mouse for you.Overall this mouse is fantastic, and for 14 dollars I don't know if you can get a better deal. I definitely recommend this anyone looking for a game mouse but cannot spend a lot of money on it.As a side note, here are some other specs that are on the box that are not listed in the Amazon page (I want to include this so you can get and even better Idea about the mouse):- Gold Plated USB plug- 10 million click life- 8 mm width scroller- 5 Programmable buttons (as the 6th is the one that changes the dpi and the program has no way to change that.)

    ***Product review update after 2 long years of use***So, I've had this product for about 2 years now and have tried trouble shooting a lot of the problems myself, but now it's gotten to the point where I no longer want to waste more time on trying to salvage this thing. About 1 year of owning this mouse with moderate use, the scroll wheel started acting up and wouldn't catch anymore because the rubber part has it has lost its tension around the wheel and would slip when I'd scroll. At that time, I took apart the mouse and superglued the rubber piece to the underlying plastic wheel (which had no scoring or texture for the rubber to give it traction). I also unhooked the LED light power supply at that time because the breathing red light was just horrendous after about 3-4 months of having the mouse (wished there was an option switch this light on/off without having to take apart the mouse). The second fix came about 18 months after having the mouse but the left click button stopped working consistently. It would register only about 70-80% of the clicks and about  30%% of the time it would register as a double-click. I took about the mouse again and swapped the left and right click buttons, but this only helped with problem for 1-2 months. In all, the mouse lasted me just under 2 years with the tinkering that I had to do.Bottom line:Is it good for the average user?-Yes, for about 1 yearIs it good for the avid user/ gamer?-No for the avid user. No for the gamer, although this is a decent starter mouse to give you the feel of what you'd like for the more permanent replacement.Would I buy this again?-Unlikely---------------------------------------------------Great mouse for the price. It's stylish and has a quality feel to it. The braided cord is a nice touch and actually feels very rugged (I think it has a like a 10 lb tension to it or something). The buttons are rubberized for grip, which is nice and so far none of it has rubbed off or gotten sticky.The DPI button works pretty well and I definitely can tell the difference between the different settings.I bought for everyday net browsing, word processing, and occasional online gaming.The one thing that kind of bothers me about the mouse is contour. It feels like it's made for either right or left handed people and the design kind of makes the grip not as comfortable as it could have been. So along the sides of the mouse, there are grooves for your thumb and your 4th/5th finger. The thumb grooves feel pretty natural, which is very nice, and the side buttons are great too because they are textured differently to allow you to differentiate between the two. However, the grooves for the 4th/5th digit do not feel quite right. There is a little over hang from the buttons, that kind of forms the grooves, and it feels a little restricting. I know it seems like minutia, but I've formed a little callus on the medial side of my 4th finger because of this.

    as a budget option this is a fantastic mouse, it feels good to hold, is customizable and comfortable to hold. they perform serviceably and i have not had any real issues functionality wise.the saying goes ""you get what you pay for"" and this holds true to an extend for these, i have gone through two and will be ordering a third one as the pads underneath, and mouse buttons tend to start going after a couple of years or so of use while my other mice have lasted reasonably longer.while i do personally not care for this fact, it is one that i am ok with.if youre on a budget or dont mind replacing it every few years, i would say seriously consider this as a budget or shorter time mouse to use.for 20-30$ this performs well and is a solid option for people on a budget

    I have been an owner of this mouse since November and honestly, I like using it due to the fact that it works out of the box, has software that's easy to install and easy to use, and because it also has a rapid fire/click button which I have customized it to where 1 click would equal 5 clicks. My only critiques of this mouse is that some spots of the RGB lighting are dimmer than other spots and that the dpi buttons and lighting button on top of the mouse are kind of loose.

    I got this as a gift for a 10 y/o who is really into gaming. He was initially thrilled by the sheer design and look of the mouse but after using it for an hour of play he made the announcement that he was filled with happiness over the shortcut buttons and programmable ability along with the colored lights. This old head doesn't know exactly what that means but you might!

    This is a great mouse for cheap and has some nice features. I would give 5 stars if not for two things: It feels too light and the left mouse button often squeaks when clicked. I was able to fix the latter issue myself and I have directions below on how to do so.The mouse seem fairly well built and has been quite responsive on my computer. Personally, I think the appearance could be less garish (no need for an LED backlit logo or red plastic accents). However this is subjective so it doesn't factor into my review. The DPI button is the black chevron just behind the scroll wheel. When clicked, it switches between the various DPI settings which noticeably changes the tracking feel of the mouse on the screen. The scroll wheel has nice bumps between each notch. I feel like these could be a bit more snappy, but it's a very nice-feeling wheel nonetheless. The mouse buttons are responsive but quite audible, so don't buy it if you want a quiet mouse. The forward and back buttons on the left side are placed well for easy access by the right thumb, and the forward button is covered in raised bumps for texture and grip. The mouse feels good in the hand (my hands are medium-sized) and is comfortable for a palm grip. The USB cable seems like it will last a long time. When connected to Windows (7, 64-bit) for the first time, the drivers are found quickly without issue.My two issues with the mouse are rather minor. The first is that it is surprisingly light, and I would like a slightly more weighty feel to provide more resistance across the mousepad. The mouse does come with a set of weights inside, but these should have been made much heavier (or the materials of the mouse itself made heavier) because weights can always be removed but more cannot be added. Redragon should have erred on the side of a heavier mouse that users could make lighter if they wanted instead of a light mouse that can only be made lighter. At any rate, I haven't found the weight to measurably impact my experience with the mouse, it's relatively minor preference.However, the left mouse button began to squeak fairly regularly almost as soon as I started to use the mouse. This should not be the case and should have been caught in quality control before the mouse went to marked. The squeak is rather subtle but just noticeable enough to be aggravating. While the squeak doesn't always occur (and seems to be based on where your finger is on the button when you click) under my normal use I found that it squeaked the majority of the time when I had my finger placed where it was most comfortable for me. However, I was able to fix the click and now I have no remaining significant issues with the mouse, but I took a star off the review because this issue should not need to be fixed by the user.-------INSTRUCTIONS FOR FIXING THE SQUEAK [Materials needed: Small phillips screwdriver, exacto knife]1. Unplug the mouse and remove the two teflon pads near the rear of the mouse. I used the exacto knife to pry these up and off.2. Remove the 2 screws that hold the top and bottom sections together.3. Pinch the sides of the top section together near the front (but below the buttons). Gently pull the sections apart.4. Turn over the top half and remove the 3 screws holding the circuit board onto the top half. Gently pull the circuit board back and away from the two tabs holding it in place.5. Now with the top half disconnected from the bottom, identify the left mouse button (reversed when upside down). Click the button and notice where the moving plastic part slides past the stationary plastic. Along the inner edge side  of the stationary plastic should be a very slight protrusion that rubs against the moving part. Carefully slice between these two with the exacto knife, putting pressure toward the stationary segment so that you shave away a very slight amount of plastic and the protrusion is removed.6. Test out the button with a number of clicks in different areas to make sure the squeak is gone. If you're certain it is, slide the circuit board back into place, reattach it with the screws, and carefully pinch the sides of the top half together again. Note that there are tabs near the front of the top section that need to slide underneath the matching tabs on the bottom section. This might take a couple of tries, but gently try to match up the tabs and slide the top back into place. Don't use a lot of force! Then replace the bottom screws and the teflon pads and plug the mouse back in.After I reassembled the mouse it still works perfectly fine and the squeak is gone. Hopefully this helps you too.

    update: August2018: still works, middle click stopped working a while back.  Inexpensive, sorta, so maybe I shouldn't expect more, IDK.update 13Jan2017: it still works, a relief after that crummy Logitech trackball. I originally gave this 2 stars, but I've changed my mind. It works fairly well. They advertise this for gaming, something i know nothing about. I assumed it would have more programmable buttons, maybe like some fancy trackballs. Maybe I didn't know what I was buying, I expected a bunch of whizz-bang features. This mouse has served me well, for a while now. While I'm disappointed it didn't have more features, it does the job well. So, for surfing and such, I'm raising my rating from 2 to 3 stars. Maybe I'll revisit this review. If it's still working in a year....I don't know if this is good for gaming, but for most of my stuff, it's been decent. Maybe there are cheaper mouses that are as good. But as far as this mouse, so far, so good. I can tell you it has a thing in it with weights.update 25Oct2015: Here it is a week later, still working. I bought the #1 best seller trackball the Logitech m570 previously, the scrollwheel went out within months. So much for Logitech products. This mouse the RedDragon, is still working after a week or so. Not a great emdorsement, but at least its working. I write negative reviews to both help others stay away, and to hurt the company making rotten products. If this mouse goes south, I'll do an immediate update. I've explained my frustrations below.The feel of the mouse is pretty good, its symmetrical, nice for you lefties. I have no need for wireless, this thing is corded, which is one less thing to go wrong.Where I live now, I have a tiny desk, surrounded on both sides by furniture, so there's limited space. I wanted a trackball, because of space limitations. I've read that trackballs are less popular, fewer are available, possibly meaning the competition isn't there, nor is the quality.I prefer trackballs, but setting the sensitivity(mouse/cursor speed) has made this fairly comfortable. If you're not a gamer, & I'm not, I suppose you could do worse. Because I have this mouse, I can risk tearing  apart my Ancient MacAlly trackball, with the hope of getting the scroll wheel to work again. I am not a Mac user, but the trackball's 4 buttons were sufficient, and one can work around the nonfunctional trackball. Ít came only with Mac software, so wasn't customizable, but the default setup is the most logical setup anyway.But who wants to?------------------------------------I'm not a gamer, so Io can't say anything to help you folks. I expected a bit more from this mouse, I guess I love buttons, this hasn't been a great choice, it doesn't seem to be awful, either. Somehow I thought I'd be able to use the 6° button for *enter* or something, i once had a fancy trackball with extra buttons/functions.Really, for the regular non-gamer like me, this mouse has the minumum buttons acceptable, l;-click, R-click, forward & back.When one's looking to. buy this, on thee page, further down, you'll see several more mouses Many seem to share the same body shape, and nearly the same lights on the mouse-body. I can't evaluate  those mouses, just mentioning the similarity in appearance.So far, this mouse hasn't been too bad, the frustration of driver-software is something that angered me, So far, this mouse hasn't been too bad, question is---will it at least hold up for a year or more? I'll update if/when  it fails.I guess for a non-gamer, this isn't anything special, but doesn't seem to be the worst possible choice, either. The mouse is always lit, kind of serving as a nightlight. You should probably cover it, as they say even a little light can hurt your sleep, I don't cover it, tho.ORIGINAL REVIEW  18OCT2015:Went to register product--site given on box was wrong. I went to their home page, found I could register from there. Strike one.No software provided w/mouse. Not good. Went to website, clicked to download for * Centrophorus *  mouse. Box says this is a 6 button mouse, yet the box has the strange name I just gave. But on their website, the download is listed as for Centrophorus, a 5-button mouse.--------------------------------I downloaded that, what else could I do? Must restart PC, OK. PC locked up on restart, had to go for a 2nd restart. Finally, I find 5-button software in the start menu. The picture on the set-up software is clearly not a picture of this mouse. On the set-up software, click on *hardware*, of all things, it says the manufacturer is Microsoft!  Since this software is the new stuff on my PC, it must be the driver for this mouse.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just behind the scrollwheel is a chevron, or arrow shaped key. I can depress it, nothing happens. The set-up software that I installed from the Challenger site show no such arrow.--------------------------------------------------------------------I am not a gamer, I bought this based on the good reviews, & supposedly fair price. The  aggravation I encountered in the first hour  of ownership makes me sorry I bought this. I don't care how well it works from here on out--it deserves no more than 2 stars. I doubt that it is a good long-term mouse, & it provides nothing more than a fairly simple mouse. You might want to look elsewhere. Even if I've made a mistake on one of these issues, which I doubt, this was just unpleasant. Its nothing special, & the stupid lights & cute dragon picture should be annoying in short order.--------------------------------------------------------------As a final insult, I went back to the Challenger website. I downloaded the *manual*  for the M601, which is this mouse. The *manual* is the same thing as the useless paper they give you with this mouse. On one side of this paper(long, when unfolded) is Chinese & English writing, telling you nothing of value. The other side of this large sheet is in several European languages. I don't think that side explains anything, either.--------------------------------------So, I've bought myself trouble, at best a near minimal mouse. Bet you could find a much cheaper mouse than this with the same features. And joy of joys, if you keep your PC in your bedroom, maybe you'll need to cover it so as to not mess up your sleep, with the light & all.This thing is pretty, but its really kinda crummy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Notice that under every bad review is a comment by the company to fix things. Do you really think they care? I Don't!!

    Alright, so to be clear - this mouse has a sensor that will not compete with a name brand companies optical gaming grade sensor in terms of tracking and consistency (ie. Logitech, SteelSeries, Zowie, etc.). Now let's continue to the review.At the price point of $12.99 this mouse definitely exceeded my expectations. Seriously for the price I was not expecting much, mainly the reviews and non-outrageous looking pictures of the product drew me in. I work from home time to time along with playing games quite a bit, I love FPS games particularly. I got this as a ""back-up"" mouse as i'm used to using a rival 300 (and like quality mice) for FPS games and such (competitive). My requirements for a back-up mouse were simple - needs forward and back buttons, doesn't look to crazy, does what it's supposed to do. My rival had recently broke after several years of reliable performance. The build quality on this mouse appears to be on-point. Nothing felt loose or cheap about the process while inspecting it/holding it in my hand right from the unbox. The mouse clicks were firm and comparable to most gaming mice i've used in the past, they have an omron click feel (to me).Now for my take aways:The sensor seems to be a little sluggish at times, nothing super critical but coming from a high quality sensor it was definitely something noticeable, but at $12.99 it was something to be expected. Their is a reason most newer/more known gaming mice go for more of a premium price, being around $60-80. I will note that most premium gaming mice do include custom UI software that allow for more in-depth custom tuning. If you're looking for that you will not find it here but come on.... $12.99...Definitely made for a crowd with smaller hands. The rival 300 was a little bit big for me but still comfortable, this mouse definitely is a lot smaller but still fits alright for me. An extended gaming session could yield some discomfort, but again depends on your grip style and size of your hand.The side grips on this mouse are plastic, probably helps with durability/life of the mouse shell and cosmetic appearance but doesn't sit well with me in lines of comfort. Not a huge deal for the purpose that I bought it for but something definitely worth noting.The red led light is constantly in a ""breathing"" mode but it doesn't really bother me as i'm used to rgb lighting.Most places i've seen this mouse advertised promote custom UI software but this (currently) does not appear to be the case. Mouse settings in windows control panel seems to be your options for remapping which for me is not a big deal but was definitely a misleading thing. If you're trying to bind custom loops then you might be disappointed.The shape of the mouse takes some getting used to, a combination of the smaller size and plastic wrapped completely around (rigidness). I'm used to mice shaped more towards ambi with a slight right-handed dominant contour.Overall, even with my takeaways they were not critical enough of issues to really bring the rating of this product down for me. The build quality is nice. Braided cable. Lengthy cable. Crisp lighting (for those who are into that sort of thing). On the fly dpi switching.If you're considering this product I would recommend it. Good for any one on a budget, looking for a decent back-up until a major name replacement, or someone who just doesn't care about brand names. I've read reviews of others who had faulty mice, no issues on my end so far. If I run into anything I will update this review but i'm currently awaiting my main replacement which is going to be a zowie fk2. As I said from the start I will leave you with, if you're coming from a major name gaming mouse this will not be 100% comparable in terms of accuracy of the sensor. Don't expect a Zowie, Logitech, SteelSeries, etc. comparable sensor. I would recommend this product. Great back-up, or entry level gaming mouse.

    The mouse itself works fine and has lovely RGB colors, but it's a headache to figure out where to find the software to program it since Redragon has like 3 different websites to search for it on and they don't provide any sort of link to it with the mouse documentation.Once I finally found the correct software for the M910 Ranger, it just says ""No Device"" and won't detect the mouse. I tried all sorts of things to fix it and googled around for a several hours and couldn't figure out how to get it to let me program it. Just finally threw my hands up and gave up. I saw many others have the same problem with this mouse when I was googling it.So in the end, I had to download X-Mouse Button Control free software separate from Redragon just to be able to program the buttons. It doesn't seem to find the ""Fire"" button so I can't change that to something else... but at least it let me change the 2 side buttons to control the media volume which is what I always use those for.So, useless headache software that didn't let me program it so I had to find my own work-around, but the mouse itself is working just fine otherwise.

The mouse operates as intended and feels and looks good. My only gripe with it was finding the software for it. On the manufacturer's download page, I downloaded the software for the M910RGB (which I assume is the black counterpart to the white version I chose, which has the model number M910-W). It wasn't able to find the mouse as a device, and it looked like it was made in the early 2000's. Notably, this software was not the one advertised in the images provided for the mouse. I then downloaded a similar yet different software for the M910KS/M910-WS mouse, (it looked like it could be wired or wireless) and it worked correctly. I'm able to change DPI settings intricately, the color settings, et cetera. This software was also the one that seems to be depicted in the images for this mouse model. Overall, a very confusing setup, and it seems like, looking online, I'm not the only one who had trouble with it.

    Replaced my pathetically inadequate Logitech G502 SE Hero which succumbed to unresponsive and double clicking buttons at about 15 months of moderate use. I still have legacy mice from the 90s that work, so...It did it at a fraction of the price, too. $15.99 on Black Friday special, and not much more at other times.This mouse has a more generalized ergonomic as well, so my weaker right two fingers don't false click and otherwise fall of the right side of the rodent.  It's a bit lighter than some gaming mice, which I like.  Cord is slightly less flexible and long than some others as well, but it's plenty adequate for my purposes.For those without undisciplined kids in the house, it comes with a sheet of Redragon stickers. Get this as either a primary or a spare mouse today!

    OK, I am NOT a gamer...I am a fat old woman with big fingers and hands who cannot stand using the touch pad on my laptop.  This mouse is comfortable, responsive, and I really like the lights for aesthetic reasons and because it helps me find the mouse when it drops off the desk.  It was truly plug and play and I have used it for online streaming, some simple computer games, and online jigsaw puzzles which actually requires a good mouse to select and move the pieces quickly and easily.  So, if a person who does Yahtzee and jigsaw puzzles doesn't count as a ""Gamer"" then I doubt my race review will matter to many.  But, I do love this mouse.

    I order this mouse in early 2016. I used it to accompany a really low-grade laptop that I used for just about everything that required internet access when I wasn't in high school. I had used it all throughout high school and am using it through college and for casual gaming on the side as well.Now the durability of this thing is impressive in my case compared to many other reviews I see here. It has fallen off tables onto solid stone floors and average school floors (hard tiles and such) multiple times without so much as a slight dent to the outer shell part. The only parts to sustain long-term damage have been the USB portion of the cable where it has slightly warped over the years due to how I would wrap it, and the connecting portion of the cable to the mouse body which has started to show bare wires with their internal coverings intact.As for the consistency in the useability of the mouse.The multiple sensitivity settings have been of great use in day-to-day life with a very easy switch at any time. The mouse wheel has not degraded or slipped in any way for me. The movement is only VERY SLIGHTLY jittery when trying to do precise movements. The buttons on the side I have yet to actually do much of anything with, leaving them as quick access back and forth buttons for browsing has actually been my preferred setting with them.Even now after I've upgraded my set up to a full-blown tower with a new keyboard, headset, and monitor this mouse still holds up to everything I require from it.The only real downside I can point out is maybe how easily it gets dirty over time with the design of it including so many open holes near where my thumb rests, allowing for nasty dirt and sweat build-up over time. Also, the mouse is slightly too small to fit the right side of my hand. My hands are just about average size and my ring finger and pinky have to hang off awkwardly to the side most of the time which can cause them to cramp up if I'm not careful and make sure to move them once in a while.Other than that I definitely recommend buying this mouse for the sheer durability offered by it at such a price range. 3.5/5

    This mouse is truly amazing I have over 4 mouse's from redragon and all of them are amazing but this one is definitely different, the texture of the mouse is outstanding it has like a rubbery none slip feel to it compared to the m711 FPS version. The mouse also have a rapid fire button which I haven't used yet but I'm fond to it ( I've used it before ) Rapid Fire on a gaming mouse basically does like a million clicks in a second very useful for MMORPG games.There's are 3 buttons top button is for (HIGH DPI) second button (Lower DPI) third button ( Customizing the RGB themes ) There are two other buttons of the side of the mouse I'm assuming maybe forward and backwards for internet pages (example) - if you go to YouTube or whatever website and you click on image you can press the first side button and it'll basically bring you back to the previous page. So instead of clicking on the internet back or forward button on the webpage you can do it on your mouse.In front of the mouse it showcases the RGB looks truly amazing definitely helps at night on my mousepad to see in front of me lol. You can download the program for the mouse on the website ( which i have ) and it'll basically give you all types of customization options from ( DPI - RGB Colors - RBG Color Effects )Scroll wheel on the mouse is extremely smooth and highly responsiveOverall this mouse is a A+ for gamers, office users, regular people that wants a mouse.The price is definitely Fair, Affordable, Durable, I would recommend #RedragonGaming #Redragon Mouse to anyone and everyone that's looking for a amazing top of the line affordable mouse!( Wired Gaming Mouse )

    -Function-Product worked right out of the box.  All buttons even the DPI setting button on top.  It seems the only reason for software is to control light and a GUI for the settings.  Personally, I'm not going to install the software as I don't know this company and frankly, don't trust software out of China.This is a Made in China mouse - I wanted something corded and inexpensive and this fit that bill.  Plus, the pulsing glow is satisfyingly cool.  It rotates all colors all on it's own.The DPI setting works as expected - I had to change the default promptly but the mouse does remember its setting so you should be able to set it and forget it.-Feel-This mouse stuck out because of the weights included, however I find it is hardly noticeable with the weights in or out.  I like a heaver mouse, which I thought this was, but it feels lighter.  Just my opinion.Last, the mouse is rather flat and not very curved on top.  Again, I like more curve and this falls short of my desires.There is nothing wrong with the mouse.  If I shopped this in the store, I might not have bought it though.- Impression -I was very impressed with packaging.  It comes in a translucent plastic box with locks on 4 sides.  Inside, the mouse is snug in a plastic tray along with a brand logo (who doesn't love stickers!) and instructions.  The instruction manual has about 6 pages dedicated to each language known to man - it's a book!- Recommendation -I would recommend this mouse to someone who isn't like me.  I like a heavier mouse and one with more curve on the top.  I'm probably a little picky, but I use my computer for work and play so I want comfortable-to-me tools.  There isn't anything I can say negative objectively about the mouse.I believe it is worth the price and would satisfy most people's needs.

    (Note review for M601 gaming mouse--be sure to select style/color to get reviews of the one you actually care about. Why do they combine the score for these? This seems very wrong.)I've been using it daily for well over a year and it's great. Not just great for the price, it's great.For the most part, it's great, and at the price it's excellent. It tracks well, detects lifts accurately, buttons are nice, and the glides are a great match for various hard mouse pads. The buttons are a rough nonslip texture. The sides are vented to keep the fingers cool. The shape of the buttons makes it easy to keep track of where your hand is on the mouse. The knurled mouse wheel is great--not too hard to turn, but a definite feel that you have reached the next tick. It does not go sideways and I *really like* that. You can tell the two thumb buttons apart by feel.If I could change one thing about the shape, it is that sometimes my thumb slips when I lift the mouse to reposition it, and I am worried I will press the button under the thumb by accident. I haven't yet, but it's the one thing I would change.The weights pretty much exactly offset the drag of the cord. They would not be necessary if the mouse were cordless, but ironically if the mouse were cordless it would have a big battery in it, so it's a moot point really.But when I first put it down onto the SX, the feet weren't flat. On the perfectly flat aluminum pad, it rocked back and forth on two feet. Just a little, though, and I was thinking: maybe the plastic is just thin enough that it can be bent out of shape? Grabbing the body/frame of the mouse and twsting it firmly, I was able to straighten the frame, and now it sits flat. But if you don't feel like firmly-but-gently torquing your mouse into the right shape you might want to go upscale and pick a different mouse.I didn't even notice the warping on a soft pad, so if you use a soft mouse pad this is irrelevant.[UPDATE] It did once gradually twist back into ""not sitting flat"" mode. I twisted it again and it has stayed flat ever since. Maybe just a fluke.[UPDATE several hours later] I'm noticing that this mouse has awesome glides. Easily as good/better than SS teflon replacement pads. I'm sure the SS mouse pad will ruin them within a day or two, of course. Still sitting flat so I'm going back up to 5 stars again.[UPDATED several times] It's a few weeks later and it's still flat, so there you go.

    My old mouse broke so I needed to buy a new one. I looked online for something on the cheaper side that would hold up for a while. Found this mouse online and I was pretty happy with the product.It arrived pretty quickly inside its own case. The case is durable, so the mouse wasn't nicked or in bad condition upon opening the box. Inside there were instructions for warranty and a booklet about the mouse.Now for some key features of the mouse. You can switch between 1000/1600/2000 DPI. There is one button to change between DPI, the scroll wheel, left and right click, a button to go backwards/forwards in tab history. You cannot customise any of the buttons which I saw as a downside. As this is a gaming mouse I would have like the ability to at least have customised the side buttons. It's also a shame that the light under the DPI button doesn't stay on. It changes brightness depending on your DPI setting, but it would have been nice if it were actually on when you have it at 1000 DPI. What I really liked was the weight tuning kit. I played around with different weights until I found the one right for me. For a cheap mouse I wasn't expecting this, so it was a nice feature. It's also not hard to change the weights or open the bottom of the mouse. The braided cord also doesn't get tangled as easily as the cord to my old mouse which saves me the frustration of untangling. It's also pretty durable so I don't have to worry about any accidental tugging causing rips or tears. Another thing that bothered me was that you cannot invert the left and right click, so if you like using the mouse with your left hand, things may be a bit harder for you.This isn't a high quality gaming mouse, so I personally wouldn't play any CS or many fps with this mouse as I prefer having customisable buttons on the side to limit keyboard use, but it works well for most other games especially if those games have adjustments for mouse sensitivity. It is very easy to click this mouse, so if you play any games requiring constant clicking this would work well for that purpose. That being said, if you don't want to accidentally click anything you may want to be careful with how much pressure you put on the buttons.Overall, this mouse serves its purpose and I can see it lasting for a long time. It's pretty good quality for the price even though there are some shortcomings. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a simpler gaming mouse on a budget.

    I am a big fan of Redragon mice! I usually buy them when they are on sale, but even when they are not on sale, they are still super affordable. Their build quality, feel, and features are on par with the expensive mice for a fraction of the price. I'm a bit of a keyboard and mouse snob and collector. I will often buy them on sale even if I don't really need them, just because I just like to change them out and see what feels and works best. I've had four different model Redragon mice so far (3 wired and 1 wireless) and all of them have worked great. None of them have had any mechanical or LED failures at all.

    Upstairs I have a white and black version of this mouse. On a black mouse, dust collects and makes it look ugly. On a white mouse, dust still collects, but the white color camouflages the dust. It is an easy task to clean a black mouse, but this task needs to be performed quite often. However, on a white mouse, the war with dust is not as detailed. Most of the time, a dust war cannot be seen on white terrain.Downstairs I only have 1 black mouse. But I keep it downstairs because I can never see any dust collect on the black mouse when downstairs. There is a dust war upstairs, but there is no dust war downstairs. Everyone has a different environment. You will need to perform research in your own environment to find out if you need to fight off dust. I have to upstairs, but I don't have to downstairs.

    I won’t lie, I have a lot of game rage so I blow through mouses quickly. I have two PCs, one at home and one for college. My college PC is brand new and premium and I had a good MSI setup going. I tried the RedDragon mouse for my home PC and was so impressed I came back to college with it and threw out the MSI mouse which was actually more expensive surprisingly. One thing I’ll note that is a bit weird is that the DPI button is under the mouse and RGB buttons are on the top. Kinda strange but aye I gotta get my exercise in one way or another so thanks for that as well.

    My husband had gifted me a keyboard from this same company, and I liked it! When I was in need of a new mouse, I decided to look to see if Redragon had some good ones! No problems with it at all! A great mouse overall!

    A mi novia de manos pequeñas le resulto algo incómodo, pero si no es tu caso lo encontraras muy ergonómico. A diferencia de otros modelos, la calidad del cable es igual a la de las fotos, el tejido se ve resistente. Por el precio vale la pena.

    I like RedDragon. I have several other devices from them as well. However, this mouse has some weird quirks. First off, I got it used from Amazon Warehouse. It took basically 3-4 weeks to get it. Next, there is a software package you can install to control the lights, speed, etc. I strongly suggest using it, because the mouse will randomly change color or pattern of the lights. Finally, it doesn't fit completely comfortably in my hand. The material used where your thumb rests just feels... odd.I don't hate the mouse, I'm just really glad I didn't pay full price for a brand new one.

    I tried several and this one is a winner. I don’t play games but it flies through word processing and spreadsheet work like a champ.  Extremely accurate and smooth. For that price.  Come on this would be great at twice the price.  And BTW you can set the fire button to double click. Open files and folders with one well-placed button.

    So far this is a great mouse--especially for the price. The main 'bump' is towards the back of the mouse which I like because I have more of a claw grip. I've been running a DeathAdder (also great mouse) but its main bump is in the middle which doesn't work with my hands as well.

    I use this mouse not for gaming but for the extras this mouse has. First, I hate it when batteries run out on your mouse; that is why I like wired. Next, this mouse has extra buttons you can program to do whatever you need. The colors are cool, and it goes only with my mouse pad, which also has colors.

    This mouse has a lot of nice features. The RGB is really nice with different modes to cycle through. Buttons are very tactile and offer a solid ""click"". The ability to adjust dpi on the fly is really awesome. There are two buttons for adjusting it up/down on the top and the color change that flashes for couple of seconds determines the dpi setting you are currently using. You can also use the third button on the top of the mouse to adjust the RGB. There is also a rapid fire button next to the left mouse click and a mode switch button at the bottom of the mouse. Lots of great features for such an inexpensive mouse. Smooth, beatiful, and comfortable to use.

    [Updated 2/15/24] My computer used to automatically go to sleep after a timer and stopped doing it recently. I left the mouse unplugged overnight to troubleshoot and woke up to a sleeping computer. I believe it's either the stiff cord causing the mouse to move very slightly when there's a vibration, or something in the mouse software. I have noticed the mouse moving on its own a few times since I wrote my last review. For reference I use a Windows 10 desktop PC. This ""feature"" may not be an annoyance to some but I'd rather spend money on a mouse that doesn't do this.-------Old review:Good option if you want a cheap gaming mouse with RGB. The only cons for me are: the wire's braided material does not allow it to lay flat on your desk (pictured). The included Redragon software is lackluster and could use some improvements; it's a bit slow and tends to leave itself open upon startup instead of auto-minimizing itself. Also, to use the programmable buttons, they need to be bound to something in the software, they cannot be ""OFF"" or unbound or no program will detect them. Annoying if you want to bind them to something for a game but have them not work otherwise, though you could always program one of the top buttons to switch between profiles. The included ""Rapid Fire Button"" is kind of an awkward reach even for someone like me 5'10"" with big hands, I'd rather it be somewhere on the side of the mouse instead of way in the corner of the left-click. Either way, decent budget mouse, though I personally would look for something with a less stiff cord and better software.

    You will think this is a high DPI mouse, well it is not, what they advertise is misleading as the 8000 DPI are divided by ""modes"" where the real DPI of the mouse is only 4000.Well, it turns out you need a software to access the whole 8k DPI.It works pretty well. Customer support was fast in providing an answer. Left it at 4 coz the info should be more clear.

    There are a lot of different gaming mice out there but a lot of gaming mice on the market in my opinion kind of just over do it. They are just way to expensive or have to many unneeded features (like 12+ buttons, covered in rainbow RGB lighting, wireless or have a super weird shape/feel)I just need a simple gaming mouse…I was at tech-school for my training in the Air force (I know, weirdest place out of anywhere) and I had my gaming laptop mailed to me so on my days off, I could play games with my sister & friends. For a long time I used a basic Dell computer-lab work mouse, and it gets the job done but I thought maybe it was time for a fun upgrade. There was a GameStop at a mall and there I bought a white colored Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse. I'm going to tell you now… I immediately LOVED it! Perfect balance of a gaming mouse with some cool features but not overdoing it. Exactly as it says in the name… it's the basic essentials for a gaming mouse! And for the price of $30? Not bad at all.The size, shape and feel is really good. not overdoing it in my opinion, giving a great ergonomic feeling when in use. The two extra side buttons are great and not overbearing (like with some mice and their 6+ extra buttons all over the mouse) two, in my opinion, are just enough. Lastly the fact that it's wired is nice, helps with price & simplicity. It has some RGB lighting but not all over the place or crazy so no complaints for that.I rebought one but in the color black so it better matches my laptop and gave my sister the white colored one. Had the white one for almost a year and had ZERO issues or problems with it. If you want a simple, nice and cool gaming mouse that is just the ESSENTIALS this is for you!!!!

    I LOVE this mouse. I got it after getting back into PC gaming after a hiatus.PROS:-Feels great in-hand.-Cable is plenty long.-It's not heavy, but it has a decent weight to it.-Build quality is solid.CONS:-The only bad thing I have to say about this mouse is after a couple months of daily use, the scroll wheel sensors don't function properly. After doing some research, it looks like dust builds up on the sensor, making the wheel ""bounce"" when scrolling.SIMPLE FIX: Blow into the space between the mouse and the scroll wheel. If you have pressurized air that will work much better. It's only a temporary fix, and can get annoying, but it does fix the issue!Other than that one issue, this mouse is incredible for the price. Likely will upgrade to something a little more ""pro"" in the future, but for the last few months this has held up great, and I'll likely use it for another 6+ months before upgrading.

    I disagree that this mouse is considered a gaming mouse.  Other than the fancy logo and color changing LEDs, there is not much about this mouse that caters it for gaming.  I use gaming mice and prefer ones with more than just two side buttons, and a much heavier weight.  This is a lightweight mouse which is fine for office work where you're in front of a computer 8 hours a day, but I would much prefer something different for gaming.But as a general use office mouse, it works great.  It is ergonomic enough to be used right or left handed, the scroll wheel works fine, and the buttons press with a reassuring CLICK.  For the price, use this in your office, but if you want to get into a Call of Duty or Fortnight tournament, definitely get something else.

    Edt October 12th, 2023 -On the 9th, the right click started acting funky. I restarted my PC and unplugged and replugged it in, and it fixed. However, I believe this was coincidental. On the 10th, the right click started acting HORRENDOUS. As in, triple clicking, clicking when not pressing, dropping clicks entirely... Restarting and replugging it did not change a thing. Tested on another PC, same issue. Swapped out cable extenders, same issue. Attempted plugging it directly into the PC, as inconvenient as that would be in my setup... still the issue. Multiple ports, no help.I firmly believe stuff happens. Quality control is not, and never will be perfect. I ended up reordering this mouse off Wal-Mart to see. So far it is working flawless. The mouse is incredible, I think I got unlucky here... again. I also ordered an EVGA X20 off Amazon. Hope it goes better, too. I still think overall I would recommend this product, as it wouldn't have such a high rating so consistently if this happened incredibly often. I will dock a few starts, but I honestly still think the mouse it good.X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-XOriginal post -I first ordered a Redragon M910K, and it was faulty. I decided to put 10 extra dollars in and order this mouse instead.  Take note this is a day one review and if I have problems, I will update. Assume this is all still relevant if you see this review after a couple months and I haven't edited it.  First Impressions  -Glide is good. Feels very smooth.  -Cable pulls the mouse slightly due to the smooth glide. However, not much, and if your cable is tied forward, or simply going straight, you won't notice it. Just don't have your cable go off at an angle immediately and you need not to worry.  -Feels very... non-durable? I wouldn't slam it. If you aren't a heavy rager, it should be fine. Hit your keyboard instead. NOT CHEAP FEELING THOUGH. Feels perfectly fine for this price!  -Simple look. Black with Green LED's. Perfect printing on the logo.  -Side buttons are a bit high for me, if your thumb rests low like mine, you may have a hard time reaching them. That's why the ""Ergonomic"" is a 4 star, but only from a personal stance not an overall stance.  -Very Comfortable. Enough said  Overall, I am very happy with this, and if this review is un-updated, I still am. Just waiting for the software to install to change my DPI currently. If you are looking for a good mouse below $30, this is a good mouse. A very good mouse.  Would I recommend it at this price range? Yes.  Best regards from a fat idiot

    I was just about to buy another mouse when I decided to check the reviews for this and found out about the scrollwheel dust problem.  Sure enough, after blowing air into the scrollwheel to remove the dust from the sensor as another reviewer mentioned, the broken scrolling fixed itself.  Saved me a lot of money and frustration.  Problems began about 6 or 7 months after purchasing.  By the 8th month, scrolling was so bad that entire web articles would jump back to the top if I accidently tried to scroll down a bit.  It was making the mouse unusable.I like the ergonomics well enough, except I can't get used to the rear thumb button for gaming.  If you use your last 2 digits a lot when pointing and tend to rotate the mouse inwards like I do, the rear thumb button can end up a bit out of reach for quick responses.  Overall it is actually more comfortable than the mouse this replaced.  However, I strongly dislike the software package.  The way it runs in the background and seems to pop up randomly just gives strong bloatware vibes.I'm used to being able to change DPI on-the-fly with a button (feature of my old mouse), and I just can't seem to get used to software's DPI settings for it--it never seems right.  If one game ends up needing a different DPI setting than another, there's no other way than to boot the software up to change it.  For someone who doesn't like using in-game settings changes, this is annoying.  I'd much rather be able to stay in game, change with a button click, test, and then repeat until I get what I want.  I dislike going into menus between every DPI test, it just doesn't feel intuitive (it makes me wonder why games don't have a DPI testing mode so that I can changes more real-time).I really wish it had 2 more buttons than it has, but I knew that was going to bother me going into this purchase.The lighting is wildly annoying until you change it in the settings.  I have no idea why anyone would set ""high-speed rainbow"" to be the default lighting.  I had to unplug it to sleep the first night.With my old Corsair mouse, I could use the software to tweak the mouse, and then store profiles inside the mouse.  I could then transfer the mouse to another computer or uninstall the software and nothing would be affected.  I'm sure I'll go back to Corsair whenever this mouse dies.  There's just nothing other than overall shape where this mouse wins out over my old (sadly retired model) mouse.

    We had a Razer mouse for quite a while and all the kids used it for gaming, but over time the left mouse button started having issues.  If I wanted to click and drag a file or something from one part of my screen to another, it would often drop the item I was dragging.Finally bought a new one and that issue is gone.  New mouse is great.  Have noticed a few times that it seems to double click on the left mouse button when I didn't intend for a left click.  Hopefully that doesn't become a bigger issue.  But for the price, it's the most affordable, and still reliable, gaming mouse you can buy.

    I had used an old Death Adder Elite at work that began having issues with the scroll wheel.  I didn't want to spend $80+ on a new one, so when I saw the price tag on this one I was immediately curious.  The shape seems to be identical to the one I had (the reason I wanted another one), but the only complaint I have is that the Elite I had had a rubberized pad on either side that made it a bit ""sticky"" to your fingers so you could pick it up and reposition it easier on the mouse pad.  This mouse does not have have those rubberized pads, so I have had it slip out of my hand when trying to grip it to reposition.  So far, though, that is the only complaint I have with the mouse.  Clearly a cost-saving measure to keep the price down, but something I didn't expect and immediately noticed.

    I was using a Cyberpower gaming mouse for a few years. But recently the scroll wheel started misbehaving so I figured I'd replace it. It's not bad. I don't do much gaming these days so I just wanted a comfortable cheap mouse to replace what I had, and wanted some similar features like the side buttons that make using the internet easier. I wish it was a bit heavier but for price - sure why not? Is it the best? No. Is it better than a wally world generic? Yes. So basically, budget friendly and good for non-gaming duties.

    This mouse is a simple mouse, and it does the job! It DPI is a lot higher than my old mouse which was a the steelseries 850.Simple mouses will last the longest, complex mouses are better but if your a casual gamer, web browser, work then this simple gaming mouse will be more than enough quality for you and barely hit your piggy bank!

    I just got the Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse, and I really like it for my gaming setup.First off, it feels good in my hand. The design is simple but comfy, and the textured grips on the sides keep it from slipping during long gaming sessions. It's not too fancy, but it works well.When it comes to gaming, this mouse is top-notch. It responds super quickly and accurately, making my game moves smooth. I can also change the sensitivity settings to fit how I like to play different games.The mouse is tough and well-made. It feels strong, and the buttons click nicely, adding to the gaming experience. What's cool is that it doesn't cost a lot, making it perfect for gamers who want quality without spending too much.Sure, it doesn't have all the fancy lights like some other mice, but for the price and how well it works, I'm okay with that. It's a solid choice for gamers on a budget who still want a good gaming mouse.In a nutshell, the Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse is awesome and won't hurt your wallet. It's comfy, works great for gaming, and is a smart pick if you're looking for quality without breaking the bank. I totally recommend it!

    Great price. I've had 2 different versions of this mouse and they were both great. The white one would pick up dirt and eventually died on me after like 4 years so I bought the black one and the color is perfect. Doesnt show any dirt and works like a charm.

    This mouse is on the large side, which I personally like.  It's movement is very smooth and responsive, and the top buttons and mouse wheel all feel great and work well.  For me, the issue is the buttons on the left side, which are used for forward/back in a web browser.  The buttons are so large that I frequently bump them when I reach for the mouse, disturbing whatever I'm doing.  I know I can disable them by using the included software, but I am not currently running that software, and I don't want to have yet another service/application running simply to disable two mouse buttons that are in the way.

    This mouse is like playing on the Xbox controller versus the PlayStation 3 controller.Absolutely needed for any adult who's tired of cramping their hand trying to use a toy to control their computer. I've been using a DeathAdder since version 1 and it makes me bitter whenever I'm forced to use another mouse on a different computer simply from the ergonomics alone.

    I like the ergonomics of this mouse, and its sturdiness as well. Still, the USB output seems to fail sometimes (sometimes I have to disconnect it and then plug it in again so it works), and the Razer software is a bit bloated. I do not regret the purchase tho. Ergonomics wise, t's been a nice upgrade from my Logitech G201, still, I believe that the former has a greater value overall, since it is cheaper and since Logitech's software seems to run better.

    At first I had to get used to the size as I had just come from a small silent Logitech mouse. The click is so loud! On everything. Thing is light, hollow feeling (ok the loss of material is good for gamers because a light mouse is easy to control, but c'mon, feels cheap.) The side buttons feel like they'd wear out fast and I don't really use them, but because of that I truly can't speak of their quality. But the primary clickers (left and right mouse) have held up well. The green accents light up and its really attractive. Seems pretty snappy and responsive. Good mouse.

    Best mouse for its price, hands down. No mouse for this cheap compared to this beast of Razer products. No problems included with this mouse... except maybe the biohazard awaiting in its box. With the confident opinion of almost TWO YEARS strong, it gets just a little dirty at times. Maybe its just me and my disgusting self, which I wouldn't be surprised, or the product itself, but it feels just like a failed science project was slapped on it at times. Absolutely no issues except the need to deep clean it every so often, but This is the one product out of a few that I would personally recommend to others.

    My kid has a version of this mouse that has had zero issues in the 2 years they've owned it but this one here has been giving my wife issues with the scroll wheel after only 6 months. I disassembled the mouse and removed some small hairs and strands of plastic that were attached to the wheel itself. I don't believe these were causing the issue so I hit the wheel and encoder with compressed air and reassembled. The mouse no long has the wheel jitter but the  scrolling feels slow to me. I don't use that mouse often so my frame of reference isn't the best. I still prefer my Logitech G602 over this mouse.

    I bought this mouse when it was priced at $29.99, thinking it would be a good addition to my collection of gaming mice. However, for $29.99, you get a mouse that clearly has some design flaws.Within the first few days of usage, I noticed a number of instances in which the left mouse button was triggering more inputs off of a single click than intendedAlso, the material of the mouse versus more high end Razer products felt like this one was made out of plastic and rubber rather than aluminum or other kinds of metal and fabrics that are designed to be more flexible, responsive and comfortable.I wasn't necessarily disappointed with this mouse, but if you're looking for a cheap mouse that's branded for gaming and doesn't cut corners on quality, I recommend avoiding this one.

    I had a Logitech G604 for a few years before switching over to this mouse due to Logitech double-click issues.  I use the mouse for gaming/office, but I'm no pro gamer.The sensors feel about equal.  Logitech is supposed to be much better but I don't notice a difference.  Both mice have an easy to use dpi switch.  Redragon is slightly shorter in length which I prefer, otherwise similar size.  Button click quality is similar.  Logitech has the better body material, but it gets dirty so quick that I actual prefer the more plastic look of Redragon.  Redragon has LED.  Button layout is different but both are easy to get used to.  Logitech with the battery is heavier than the Redragon with all the weights, but it's a similar feeling on the desk.Switched from Logitech G604 (3 years) to Redragon M908 (2 months)DIFFERENCESRedragon is wired.  Changing batteries is annoying, but rarely needed.  For me the wire is fine on the desk, but on-the-go users will like the Logitech better.Logitech also has a sensor/bluetooth switch, allowing for use on two different computers.  Redragon is plug-and-play on one computer at a time, but does a better job at on-boarding macros.Logitech has the fly-wheel scrolling.  As nice as it is, it's not really noticable when you don't have the option.  Unless you access a huge table to scroll through...  Logitech also has left/right switches on the wheel, which I found annoying.Logitech has major double click issues.  Tried on two mice and changed the switch, still problems.  Those started about 9-12 months into using the mouse, so too early to compare to Redragon but it turned me off Logitech.SIMILARITIESThe sensors feel about equal.  Logitech is supposed to be much better but I don't notice a difference.  Both mice have an easy to use dpi switch.Redragon is slightly shorter in length which I prefer, otherwise similar size.  Logitech has the better body material, but it gets dirty so quick that I actual prefer the more plastic look of Redragon.  Redragon has LED.  Logitech with the battery is heavier than the Redragon with all the weights, but it's a similar feeling on the desk.Button click quality feels the same.  Button layout is different but both are easy to get used to.CONCLUSIONLogitech's only true strength was the 2-computer wireless feature.  But that alone doesn't justify the very high price compared to the Redragon.  If the Redragon doesn't suffer the same double-click issues after a year, then I'll easily prefer the wired solution than the double-click frustrations.  Time will tell though.  I'll vote 5*, easily will buy Redragon again after this, no more Logitech.

    The Redragon M913 is as good as any mouse I've ever owned, and better than many. I've owned many Logitech and Razer mouses that have cost 2-4 times what this mouse does, and none of them have been any better. In fact, I've never had any mouse last more than 2 years without developing some sort of problem needing a replacement mouse. This can get expensive. I've only had this one for a couple weeks, but if it lasts a year, it was money well spent.The good.Tracks perfectly. Very comfortable. Many buttons. Wired and wireless. Adjustable DPI. Easy to use macro software. RGB can be turned off or customized. All the buttons are recognized by Windows out of the box. The 1-12 buttons are programmed as keyboard 1-9, 0, and +, -. The extra front button is programmed as a triple left click. This makes it easy to assign keybinds in games without using macros.The bad.The twelve side buttons are small. The sensor prefers a mouse pad, and it stutters on my bare desk surface. Some people complain about the macro software, but it's similar to any other, and easy to use. Some people complain about no Bluetooth, but the 2.4 ghz works perfectly in my setup. When switching from wired to wireless (by unplugging the USBC) it takes several seconds to restablish a connection. Some say it's hard to pick up to recenter the cursor, but that has not been the case for me.Overall.This is an outstanding mouse, especially at the price point. I would certainly buy it again. However, after some use, I would maybe prefer the version that only has 8 side buttons (plus forward and back buttons).  My only gripe is that the 12 side buttons are small and hard to orient my tumb on the desired button without glancing at the mouse first. The model with 8 side buttons looks a little easier to navigate as the buttons are more spaced apart. Ignore the comments about the macro software. It's easy to use if you've ever programmed macros before. Even if you haven't, there are short YouTube videos that walk you through the process if you need them.If you want a multi button, multi function, high DPI, programmable gaming mouse at a great price, this is it. No regrets.

    So let me preface this as to why I purchased this new mouse. I am mostly an MMO player that also casually plays a variety of other games and I was previously using an original Razer Naga. It was the perfect mouse for me, fit well, worked well and the software was great. After having it for over 10 years the left click switch finally started going soft and the newer version of the Razer Synapse software no longer supported it leaving me constantly fighting with the older version not saving my button maps to the cloud properly and also requiring me to redo them.My initial inclination was to replace it with the new Naga but they made a lot of changes to the design of it. First off they changed the body shape so it didn't feel as nice in my hand and secondly they removed one of my favorite features of the two buttons on the top corner of the left click button.After searching MMO mice on Amazon I came across the Redragon Impact which had a lot of good reviews, had a similar body shape to my original Naga and had at least 1 top button on the left click button. It also happened to be on sale and Amazon was offering a coupon on top of it that day so it was at a great price. All those things considered I thought it was worth a shot.When I received it the packing was in good shape and it came in a sturdy plastic case. Installing it was pretty straightforward. Plug it in, go to Redragons website and download the software. I've been using it for about 3 weeks now and as far as the the feel of it I like the shape and size, it fits well in my hand and the pinky rest extends out further than my previous mouse allowing to rest more of my hand on the mouse. The weight of it is a little bit lighter than I would prefer even with all of the included weights inside of it and the overall feel of it seems a little less solid than my Naga was, I'm assuming it's due to a thinner or different type of plastic used for the shell.The Left click, right click and top button all feel and respond well, the side buttons I actually like the shape and layout much more than my Naga, I can reach the back row much more naturally on this mouse, but the response of the buttons are a little on the stiff side. Maybe they'll loosen up a little over time but I'd prefer them to be a little easier to press.The software is fairly straightforward, very utility driven layout if a little on the cluttered side of the UI but it gets the job done. It allows for multiple profiles to be setup, the only thing it lacks is the ability to automatically switch profiles based on the application running. For someone like me who likes to customize my button maps to my mouse over several games it requires me to manually go in and switch to the various profiles before loading up the game and remembering to switch back to another when going to a different game.All in all this is a good buy for the cost of the mouse, I'm not yet certain I will keep this as my primary mouse as I may go to a Logitech or Corsair simply for the better software, but for the time being I'm happy with the purchase.

    I bought this thing for streaming on Twitch as I wanted to be able to have all of my scene changes, backgrounds, sounds, and so on, bound to buttons so that I would not have to use my keyboard.  It is a great purchase.  The customization for this thing is something I never would have thought I would see in a mouse.  You can put macros on your buttons, you can change the lighting to any possibility available, you can change what the mouse buttons actually do, and you can add or remove weights to this mouse to get yourself a better and more personal feel.  I really do love this thing.My rating is 4/5 instead of 5/5 because the right click is already failing me.  I have not had this thing a whole year yet but the right click is to the point to where I either have to tap it several times in advance to make sure it is ready to use or I have to contort my fingers to reach the further back on the mouse so that it activates.  I know this is not correct and not due to usage because the left click has seen way more usage and still works perfectly.  This thing has damn near 20 different buttons and they all function properly except the right click!  It is like there is something stuck in it that has to be pushed out the way.  I cleaned the mouse, sprayed it out with compressed air, opened and inspected it, and I connect find a reason why it is this way.  I have other RedDragon mice and they all work perfectly.  This one started to act crazy after about 3 months.  I contacted RedDragon and am going to see how their warranty works out.  If I can get it repaired or replaced, I'll update this review with the results.Right click aside, this is still a terrific mouse.  Even if I knew I'd get this right click problem I'd still buy it just for the usefulness and customization this mouse offers.  A great product, great idea, and great execution.------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATEAfter submitting a request to Redragon and talking to support, I was able to get the problem fixed.  It was just a small piece under the right click that had slipped out of place.  Once I took it off and placed it back on, it worked just like new!  I am not even sure how I missed that but I am super glad I don't have to send my mouse off or order a new one.  A+ customer service and product.  Just ordered a mechanical keyboard from them and I think I'm a fanboy now.

    update:customer service was super helpful and fast to send a replacement and the new one seems to be working just fine, no issues with switching to wireless, no input lag, looks great and feels greatold review:as im writing this i cant use wireless, i plugged it in to charge and now that it's full battery every time i unplug the charger it refuses to work, ive given it time to switch, waited several minutes before trying everything else, ive tried unplugging and replugging the dongle like 10 times and trying different usb ports and still nothing, ive tried turning it on and off on the bottom several times and still nothing, ive tried replugging the charger back in and unplugging it again and still refuses to work while unplugged, last time i charged it i had the same issues and eventually, after like 45 minutes, it worked while unplugged but it seems it'll be an issue every time i want to switch to wireless after charging, i was so excited to finally have a white mmo mouse since it doesnt seem to be something any of the bigger mouse brands want to make but this is just too frustrating to deal with every single time i need to charge itthe buttons on the side also feel very cheap like one's gonna get stuck or fall off in the near futurebut i mean hey it looks clean and pretty i guess

    I purchased this mouse after going through three Logitech G602s; I loved those mice, except that they used a click mechanism which rapidly failed. Trying to RMA the final one required me to go through a ton of steps, so instead of dealing with that or rewarding Logitech with yet another purchase I sought out an alternative. I was a bit ""Goldilocks"" about it, wanting a wireless mouse with a lot of buttons, and after extensive searching I purchased this after a friend recommended Redragon.And... it's fine. I don't regret the purchase, it fulfills the need, but I have enough issues that I could only give a weak recommendation if you really need a lot of buttons (like I did). Note about context: I use this primarily for ""slower"" games like Stardew Valley and Subnautica, as well as daily use; I have a Logitech G502 I use for games that require lighting response such as online FPSs or Rocket League.Ergonomics is where it easily excels: I love the shape and my hand rests incredibly well on it. I was initially concerned because a lot of wireless mice I had looked at were on the small size and the images didn't give me a good idea if it would work for my big, meaty man hands but this is probably the most comfortable mouse I have ever used. Despite the size, though, it's incredibly light and can be far too easy to move around (DPI settings can only counter this so much).I would like to see them increase the battery capacity, which would help with the weight and also address the battery life. It's not horrible, but for a heavy user like myself who makes sure to turn it off at night I have to recharge it once a week. (For reference, the Logitech mentioned and a wireless Anker I also use only have to have batteries swapped once a month, if that.) Thankfully recharging can be done by just attaching the included USB-C, during which the mouse itself still works fine, so this isn't a big issue.As for using the mouse, the left/right click are quite responsive and satisfying. I actually found the left-click to be overly-responsive, as the mouse seemed to send a mouse-down command at a regular interval when I had polling set to 1000 Hz. Actually pressing the left-mouse would correct it, and dropping the polling to 500 Hz seemed to make the issue go away.A month of use out I'm still not sure how I feel about the plethora of buttons on the left side--the primary reason I bought the mouse. The number is great, but the size makes it easy to accidentally press more than one at once. The shape and placement also makes it hard to differentiate between each by feel, and the travel required for some (like #10) is quite awkward. There is a ""home"" bump on #5 but that doesn't really do much. I expect I'll get used to them over time, but it will be through rote use/memorization rather than a pleasant layout. I would have been happier with fewer buttons that were larger and easy to identify through touch. The extra button beside the left-click works great.The software... exists. It has crashed or emergency-quit on my Win7Pro machine a few times in response to switching the mouse between wireless and wired without me first turning the mouse to ""Off"", but this has never caused a large issue. The UI leaves a lot to be desired, but I can easily access options without having to dive through menus/screens. Changing the DPI on the mouse (via non-customizable buttons) shows an overlay which has caused slowdown in the game being played (no apparent option to turn this off.)  It doesn't offer profile switching (something I dearly miss from the Logitech), but you can import/export profiles so manual swapping is possible. The single largest improvement the software could have is a drop-down of profiles to simplify swapping, even if still manual.Quick thoughts: The RGB is weird (the ""breathing"" setting does not act as I expect, nor keep the exact color I selected) but as I don't care about it and can turn it off completely it's fine. The right side has a coating that feels slick or that very easily holds onto finger oil, so I often think I've gotten it dirty. This has diminished over time, though. The size might make it unwieldy for those with smaller hands and require more desk space for proper travel.In short, do I think someone would be content with this mouse? Sure. Do I think that someone /should/ buy this mouse? Ehhhh.

    I have been using this mouse just shy of a year as I had purchased this to replace my aging Redragon M901 due to a wonky middle mouse button. I hope this review can serve as an indicator for this being a good product.The M913 felt a tad bigger than my previous mouse but was still as comfortable. There is now a lip at the left side of the mouse for your thumb to rest on which I didn't even know I needed. There was no awkwardness with the ergonomics and overall feel when transitioning from the M901 to the M913 as they felt almost the same. Another improvement is that the mouse click while not quiet is much less noisy than the M901.One of the greatest pros of this mouse to me is the fact that it can be used wired or wireless. I can't review on RGB and customization as I use this mouse on ""econo"" mode that disables the RGB. This is done via a switch located underneath the mouse. I use it on Ubuntu so there is no support from the vendor with respect to their software but I do know there are third party options that can be used to control the RGB if so desired. The battery life is amazing, lasting about a month of everyday usage on econo mode.I do have a couple of complaints though. The scroll wheel can occasionally be way too sensitive as just a slight touch would cause it to scroll. The other minor complaint I have is that is seems to be a gunk magnet particularly where the ring finger rests. I find this odd as the surface is almost entirely a smooth piano black surface as opposed to my previous mouse which was a rough texture and never had this issue.Beside the minor cons I had, I think this mouse is worth the money especially at the price point. It works well for everyday tasks and I have put it through the paces for some gaming sessions with Diablo 4, Assassin Creed and Shadow of War to name a few. I have gotten so accustomed to MMO mouse for regular gaming that It would be awkward to go back to a regular mouse but fortunately it is made accessible with products like this due to the pricing when compared to some of the other brands that cost a premium.

    I loved my last Redragon mulit-button mouse, but after a number of years the buttons became unreliable, so I upgraded.Overall, this is a good mouse, especially for the price; having multiple profiles is huge, the lighting is fun (though not as versatile as I expected, but ore than my last one) and programming buttons is important (and you have PLENTY.)  I actually didn't need allll these buttons, but I discovered the mouse I was looking at only had 2 profiles, and I wanted at least 3.The cord is very flexible and stays out of the way (my last one was rigid and was always awkward on the desk.)  I like that the DPI buttons show 1-4 lighting levels.Okay, the cons:1) Someone mentioned in their review the pinky section being slightly too short.  YES.  It has actually been difficult to get used to, and I've found it distracting.  The problem is, it would be better if there was no pinky support, or full pinky support, but because it's neither, your pinky has the illusion of support without fully receiving it.  The tip of my pinky is awkwardly dangling.  Maybe I'll eventually get used to it, but it was more distracting than I expected.  My last mouse had no pinky support, and I never thought about it.2) It's slightly bigger than my last mouse, enough that it feels big in my hand.  I'm sure I'll get used to that too, but it feels less ergonomic.3) The software means well but is VERY glitchy.  It took a while to figure out because the functionality is needlessly complicated or disjointed in places (ie. past software it was easy to add custom keystrokes to buttons; this one adds an entirely different macro section that has been finicky, like doubling keystrokes when recording).  Worse, I can't even open the app most of the time, and have to force-close it in task manager for it to respond.  I am also denied access to naming the profiles, as at says I can't ""alter the default profile"" on every profile.Update:After more use, I'm finding more issues.  The mode button is not working correctly.  Normally, when you push it, you can tell the mode based on your lighting settings. This one just has random lighting pop up that has not been set, which means I have to change the mode from the software.Update 2:I added a star because the Company took initiative to address the issues, which is rare at a time when most companies are scaling back customer service.

    I used the Logitech MX Master 2 for a few years until I damaged the mouse. I first tried the Logitech MX Master 3 as a replacement but after a few days I decided to return it.  I wanted more buttons and shortcuts and I found this mouse after doing research.  At first I was skeptical due to the price (seemed too cheap) but the reviews were good.  Then I realized it's just some plastic and the margins on these mice must be huge.With the Red Dragon it took a short time to remember all the shortcuts but it was easy enough to program and I tried a few combinations until I settled on the following based on frequency of use:1. screencapture (trigger button)2. browser forward / browser back3. page up / page down4. voice transcription (win+shift+H)5. image to text (win+shift+t) via powertools6. next browser tab / previous browser tab7. zoom in / zoom out8. vol up / vol downAt first the mouse felt a little bit too light and a little bit too wide, but I got over that quickly and it feels quite natural. The rechargeable battery lasts a long time, much longer than my MX 2.  Programmable buttons are easy to put to memory.The only downside which is minor is the lack of premium feel. This is a really minor downside;  Form and Function with a little less Feel, the mouse is great.

    My second time getting an mmo mouse from Red Dragon (previously the black mmo mouse). I wanted a white one this time and it's really nice.My only complaint is the mouse wheel feels rather loose when scrolling. Feels like it needs more pushing, which is usually fine but during lots of internet browsing/etc that adds up and makes my index finger kinda sore.The 1-12 button are really great and responsive. I have small hands for an adult so using my thumb on the mouse instead of 1-0 for gaming is great.  And the ring/pinky grip on the side is THE BEST. Keeps your hand from rubbing all over your mousepad. Just really ergonomic and I love that.You CAN turn OFF the rgb if you download the software which was easy enough to find. My old mouse by another company didnt have that feature and Id had to electrical tape over the obnoxious glow.For improvement Id like to see a version that has some texture to it? This mouse is super smooth and not in a good way (to me). Also seems to make my hand sweat more.

    Even as a computer nerd, I was hesitant to get a mouse with so many buttons just from an ease of use perspective, but I've been using this mouse for a month now and it's been an amazing experience and huge productivity boost, especially if your work/personal life requires being on the computer for hours. Even better, it only took a few days to get used to the extra buttons (only accidentally clicked one a couple times in the last 30 days).One big perks is there are 5 modes you can switch between, and for each mode you can give unique assignments to every button, so you can switch between modes for different workflows and assign well over 75 shortcuts/macros (15+ per mode). Even better, once you program the buttons for the 5 different modes on the mouse, it stores everything on the mouse itself, so you can hook up the mouse to any PC and use all of the buttons/macros you saved without downloading the Red Dragon software or saving the macro files anywhere, which is great if your company's IT department is stricter and doesn't allow installation of 3rd party software or plugging in USB drives.For each button you program with a macro (again, up to 15+ buttons per mode), you can tell it to either 1) loop a specific number of times (min 1, max 255), 2) repeat for as long as the button is held down, or 3) repeat until you click the button a second time. My job involves a lot of repetitive motions/tasks so this has made my job so much easier, I can automate quite a few tasks and sit back while the mouse clicks through things for me, switches across tabs/windows, etc.Definitely a game changer in my book for people seeking next gen productivity.

    TLDR; get this mouse before you spend twice as much on the other 2 big brands.I’ve had many gaming mice over the years and decided to try this one after my 3rd Corsair scimitar elite gave out after just a couple of years which I had switched to after multiple failed Razer naga.  I obviously can’t attest to the longevity of this mouse yet but right out of the box it feels way better than those other ones that cost twice as much.  The side buttons are angled and give you a better sense of which button you’re on.  The adjustable weight is really nice since I’m a female with small hands and as such I was worried about the size but it’s way better fitting than the Corsair without being small like the naga.  The fact that it comes in white is a major plus too. Now I need the keyboard haha. The only reason I didn’t give this 5 stars is the inability to program just Alt with a number as a side button.  Shift and curl and shift with alt work fine though so I had to just redo a few of my gaming keybinds to get the mouse to do what I’m used to.  The rapid fire button that you can change is also really cool as that’s a new thing for me.

    Been using it for a few months now and I love it. Beats every other big name brand out there selling mice like this for upwards of 60 dollars. It fits my hand so perfectly and I can grip it perfectly with my whole hand as opposed to other brand mice where my pinky normally hangs off the side and gets very uncomfortable over time. The smooth plastic on the key pad and rest for ring/pinky finger make cleaning it off super easy unlike some others I bought and needed a pick of some sort to get between the rubber. 10/10 will only buy mice from these guys from now on.

    I think its a good product. I dislike the thumb rest thingy and it was hard to get used to that. I've had 3 or 4 g600s before this thing and loved those but they are made badly and break, and now are discontinued. I'd think this would be pretty amazing without that thumb rest that annoys me. It's light, responsive enough, software is ok, colorful, well the dpi switch sometimes does get hit too easily on top of the mouse. Maybe they could design that a bit better so it's not accidentally set off.

    Its taking me a while to get uses to the feel of this mouse.  Its a lot wider than my old mouse.  I bought it for the number pad on the side.  I guess I have a big thumb as it is hard to select the right number button.  They are angled to try and select the right button and I will keep trying.  The battery life is shorter than my previous mouse that has RGB lights.  I do like the feel of the thumb wheel and buttons.  I like that you can adjust the DPI with a simple button push.  Not to crazy of the triple shot button, would like to be able to adjust the sensitivity of it.  The last issue is the software that you install on your PC to program the mouse.  It took a lot of work to get around McAfee web to download and install.  No clear instructions on how to get around it.  I purchased this mouse not for gaming but music writing with MuseScore.  It makes it quicker to press the number buttons on the mouse than taking your hand off the mouse and press a keyboard pad.  Worth the price and well built.  Takes getting use to but feel good in hand, that is if you have a large hand.  Great control.  Does take time to charge but you can either plug it in a usb charger or into your computer and not bother with the dongle.  Have fun.  Maybe I'll play MIST with it.

    I originally picked up the Redragon M811 to see if I could get used to using an MMO mouse and I was really impressed with it, but wished it had a few more buttons. I purchased this one hoping it would do the trick. This one is much lower profile than the original which I think is part of the problem.I have no trouble locating buttons side to side as they are angled enough to feel where you are, but the buttons are too small and too close together to quickly feel where you are on them when going up and down. It's usable, but much slower than the other one.  I tried gaming with it for a couple of weeks and have given up. It works great for video and photo editing however or I imagine any game that doesn't require fast and precise input.Also, there is no Mac application for this mouse, but as it has onboard memory you can bind the buttons on a windows machine and then use it on a Mac.

    I have been using Redragon since I got my very first laptop. Honestly, never fails on me, everything works no matter how much you use it. I had an earlier version that has been dropped over a dozen times over the course of 5 years, the only thing wrong with it, is number 5 side button is waring out slightly. I highly recon these over the expensive razor brand of mice.

    If you've already gotten your muscle memory and software configured for for 4 rows of 3 buttons from previous Redragon mice, your going to have to redo all that to get used to 4 rows of 4 buttons.  The M990 gives you more total side buttons but I didn't want to take the time and effort to rewire my brain and redo the button layout in my game to match the extra buttons.  Also the last row of buttons (13, 14, 15, 16) is physically a tiny bit further back than the last row of buttons (10, 11, 12) on the earlier M901, M908 mice and it felt like I was straining my thumb to reach it.I already knew the Redragon mouse config software was non-intuitive and frustrating to use, but I don't understand why the software is so different between the different models.  After lots of trial and error I can program the M901 mouse how I want.  The M990 software is just as non-intuitive and frustating but in a new way.If this is your first side-button mouse, none of this should be a problem.  If you've already been using Redragon side-button mice, just know you are going to have to adjust to the M990.

    I been wanting to buy a ""gaming"" mouse for ages but always thought it was ridiculous. But... every now and then I'd play a game that I just really needed some sorta hotkey or macro thing but it was too annoying to have to bind and rebind the mouse buttons or rebind all my keys just to have to rebind them again after reinstalling or I couldn't hecking remember what I even mapped everything to the very next day.I was a fool. I'm never getting a normal mouse ever again.Pros- I'm a big boy so the total 0.04lbs(19.5g) the weights add don't really help all that much but it has given me an idea to jerryrig it with some heavier metals. Very good idea overall. Makes you shooty real good.- I love multiple dpi levels so having FIVE different ones is amazing. Sometimes a game thinks 800 DPI means you should whip across the screen just by breathing but with this instead of fumbling in the settings for twenty minutes I can just lower my DPI.- As edgy and somewhat confusing as the program is for this mouse, it's very very helpful and can even bind macros and use the F13-F24 keys.- The gratuitous amount of buttons are wonderful, if there's any extra amount of nonsense an MMO tries demanding I press, I just bind those to the side of the mouse. I missed my back and forward buttons but I just bound those to 1 and 4 and problem solved.- There are multiple profiles that you can even swap to with one of the macros for those of course that play many many games and wish to have a profile for each game or each class yadda yadda.- It is 100% fully customizable, even the mouse buttons can be changed. You can rebind left click, you can rebind right click, middle click, scroll wheel, and if you don't swap between DPI at all you can even rebind the dpi buttons to do something else.- It's got gamer stickers for your PC tower or whatever if you're a weirdo who needs those.- This thing comes in an adorable little carepackage case lookin' thing. Even the weights have a tiny case.- RGB go brr. (Very customizable for any setup.)Cons- Nothing tells you where to download the fricken fracken software. I just googled red dragon software (which is not what this is) then proceeded to google ""redragon"" software and found it that way.- The program for this mouse as mentioned before is somewhat confusing.- This could entirely be because I am stupid but I thought auto-fire meant rapid fire. At first it didn't seem to fire or automatically do so either. Upon further testing it does more of a burst fire sorta thing. I thought I was supposed to just hold it down and it'd rapid fire but I guess not. This can be adjusted to fire more than a few times and adjust the ""delay"" but setting the delay to 0 doesn't do squat.- Maybe my hands are just a bit big but this ergonomic mouse doesn't feel very ergonomic. I've since just put my hand on it at an angle and it feels better but I can tell that's not the way it was designed.

    I just go this mouse and the thing hate about it the dpi button 😒 You can't change them to help you in game beside change the dpi with is the speed of the mouse. The light are change able and side button are okay it not there going to on any other mouse.  Wireless connection is perfect so no delays but no Bluetooth with okay with me.

    Completely equivalent to a Razer naga in quality and functionality, I'd even say I prefer the ergonomics of the red dragon over the razer naga. Only negative you lose with the price tag is the cord is made of a less strong material then the naga but after a month in a half I can't complain about any issues with cord as of yet. Also I would like to note the only other complaint is because I got the white and they shiny plastic its made out of dirt tends to show easier then the black on the naga. Other then that I actually prefer it over the naga and I've used the naga for close to 5 years. I prefer it even with the trade offs.

    I bought the reddragon tkl keyboard and the m913 wireless mmo mouse after my 3rd razer mouse died. I have used razer for the longest time paying the high prices but after my 3 mouse died I thought there's no way I game that much so I thought I would give the reddragon a try and I'm glad I did i like the mouse and keyboard. I was apprehensive coming from wired mouse and keyboard that the wireless ones would lag when playing fps games but I was pleasantly surprised to see how little lag if any there was.cons: If your coming from Razer software to the reddraggon software I would have to say its a down grade. While the macros worked the software was buggy and i haven't been able to tune macros as much as I would like but with any software once you find the bug you can work around it. If they made their software better I would pay double the price of the mouse. If this mouse dies the same speed as razer then atleast im saving money. Anyways

    I got this to play World of Warcraft. I was able to easily download the configuration app from the website. Configuration is a bit tricky to figure out. I suggest watching a short YouTube on it. The side buttons are comfortable. The only issue I have with them is if I have to pick up my mouse to reposition, I sometimes press a button which can cause problems if I’m mounted and I hit a button that dismounts me while I’m in the air. Splat Lol. The feel of the mouse is slick. The wheel turns nice but I kind of wish it was a bit more “clicky”. It’s a heavy mouse but I haven’t taken any of the weights out yet because I can’t get the little cover off the bottom. This is probably not an issue for everyone. I’m disabled so it could be I’m just not strong enough to do it. But even with it being a bit heavy it’s not a big deal. I feel the mouse is made more for larger hands as I have to slide my hand back just a bit when I’m using the lower 8 buttons. Again not a big deal.  I have long fingers though so more compact mice tend to feel cramped. The cable is nice, braided and soft with a Velcro strap to keep extra under control. And the bottom is metal and slides along very well. All in all I’m very happy with my purchase. Oh and it’s very pretty when it’s all lit up 😁

    I have had plenty of expensive gaming mice in my life, including razor naga trinity, high-end logitech mice, etc.  I got this mouse for my wife since it was cheaper and she is less picky.  After trying it out, I noticed it performed really well and felt really comfortable in my hand.  I ended up buying one for myself as well and was absolutely astonished by how long the battery lasts.  It advertises 45 hours but I will literally use it all day for weeks on end before it needs a charge.  Granted, this is on eco mode which turns off the RGB, but even with RGB on it was lasting well over 50 hours.  HIGHLY recommend, do not waste 100 dollars on a mouse that's going to give you the same performance with less battery life.  This mouse is an absolute gold mine.

    (READ THIS FOR GENUINE HONEST REVIEW) Id rate probaby a 3.7-4 out of 5 I purchased this mouse to replace my redragon sniper pro, specifically wanted a wired mouse with the buttons on the side and this fit the bill, downloading the software for it is straightforward and allows complete customization with the rgb colors and button programing which is extremely nice, love the adjustable weights. The build quality seems pretty decent and I love the feel of the ""click"" of the mouse, it's just very pleasing, not sure if it's just cause it's new or what. The cord does infact have a braided wrap, it feels kind of like a shoe string if that makes sense, but it's extremely bendable and moves easy which is great because it keeps the cord out of the way. Honestly the only thing keeping this from a 5 star review is the way it feels in the hand. The left side of the mouse is basically flat except for on the bottom which has the ""ergonomic"" part at the bottom. Now I understand it's pretty much flat because of the buttons so I'd be willing to forgive that, but when combined with the right side, makes it kind of hard to pick up and move when gaming, the right side has a kind of divot for your pinky than another rest ledge type thing for your ring finger, but they are both EXTREMELY smooth, almost slippery infact, which with the flat face of the left side, like I said, makes it a little different to pick up and move the mouse when gaming, like if your trying to target something and run out of room so you need to lift it up and move it further over to keep tracking a certain direction. It's not bad, it just takes some getting used to. However I like to play with basically the lowest dpi preset because I'm extremely precise with my movements, if your more of a twitchy style gamer and use a higher dpi you won't have this issue at all. Now I've only had this mouse for less than a week but so far I'm really enjoying it. I will update the review if I have any issues with the mouse that warrent changing the review.

    After a month of use I have had no major problems. In fact, aside from the software being annoying I haven’t had any issues.Mapping side buttons can only be done by the vendor software. The side buttons are actually a partial keyboard separate in the device manager from the mouse. As Windows has issues with not recognizing which keyboard a key press comes from, the remapping software changes a memory switch inside the mouse itself.However, once I got it mapped properly I quickly was able to increase my productivity.

    I'm a CPA and I purchased this mouse for data entry. I use the number keys 1-10 to input those numbers in the various software I use. I use the other buttons for delete, backspace, and, enter. This is an awesome setup for me as I save time from moving back and forth from the keyboard to mouse and vice versa.

    I've been learning (slowly) the ancient Bethesda Creation Kit for Skyrim.  It has quite a few keyboard shortcuts for moving/placing/replacing objects and I've started hating the whole Press-shift, Press Ctrl-F, Press W/E/T and whatever!  So I figured I'd give a programmable mouse a try.  I didn't want to spend too much since I'll probably lose interest in the Creation Kit in about a week anyway. :P  For only $22 on sale it was a pretty easy decision.Mouse came in a nice little solid plastic container which seems like overkill for such a cheap mouse, but whatever.  Mouse itself is pretty solid.  Side buttons are a little small, but I think I can get used to them.  Cord is very soft an pliable which is nice.  Unit came with little weights that can be swapped in and out to adjust the weight.  Though I'm a gamer, I've always thought these weights were a little gimmicky since they don't appreciably change the feel (at least not to me.)  All in all, the mouse seems pretty nice.  The only slight issue I've had is the lack of documentation.  The little tiny booklet that comes with it is kinda useless so I went to the website.  Turns out the same thing is available on the website but in a PDF format so no joy there either.  Luckily I'm a pretty nerdy dude so I soldiered on. :)  After finding and installing the software I fired everything up.  The software was a little less than intuitive, but again, with a little effort you can get it figured out.  The great news is, for a mere $22 you can make software that has lots of frequently used keyboard shortcuts MUCH easier to use.  After getting everything set up I was much more productive after a short time getting used to the button mapping(s).  You can also change the lighting and effects easily through the software and export your profiles so you can use them on other machines (my laptop for instance) without having to remap all the keys.  I haven't tried that just yet, but I'm imaging it'll work fine.  All in all, if your noodling it, just buy one.  :)

    I went from using a wired Logitech MMO mouse to using this one, and I love it so far. It doesn't feel too different from my Logitech but having more LED colors is visually stunning. The scroll wheel is great, and having the addition of a left button for instant trigger (equivalent to 3 left-clicks) is great.The battery life is great so far. I'm only down to 80% after a single charge (which wasn't even a full 0-100% charge) though I've had it on eco mode more often than not so as to not drain the battery.This is my first wireless mouse and I'm already loving not having a lot of wires cluttering my gaming laptop. Also, I use a lap desk on occasion with a built-in (albeit thin) mousepad and I've had no issues with  maneuvering the cursor.The only issue I'm having is with the right click. I have fairly small hands and shorter fingers, so I've been struggling to hit the ""sweet spot"" to do right clicking -- I have to shift my hand up from where my comfort zone is for handling a mouse and it feels a little unnatural. This is also my first ergonomic mouse so it's likely a matter of adjustment or maybe it's just not ergonomic for me in particular, ha. If you have hands/fingers on the smaller or shorter side and require instant right-clicking for your games you may want to find a slightly smaller size (if possible) or get ready to adjust how you handle the mouse/the strength at which you click.TL;DR above: Small hands & fingers, likely a user skill issue, just need to adjust hand positioning and click harder.

    I ordered this mouse back in early 2018, so I got a good year of use out of it. However due to it's low quality, even with careful use it had some notable issues. Only one big one, but that's usually all it takes and in this case it was enough to make the mouse unusable.The first and only non breaking issue I ever had was the side buttons becoming more and more difficult to press. Nothing too bad, but caused a missed input here and there due to the increase in pressure I had to put on the buttons.But that was really the only issue I was having with the mouse, and it was easily manageable.For the software, once I figured it out, it was easy to set up. The lack of Mouse 4 and 5 buttons was replaceable by binding some the side keys to it, and I adapted to using them automatically after a short time. The amount of customization allowed me to set up the mouse the way I liked and how I wanted to use it. It was very nice.The scroll wheel never gave me issues, it clicked when I need it to and scrolled when I wanted it to.Left and right mouse buttons worked fine, never had issues of cracking or breaking, missed inputs or anything.The dpi adjustment buttons could be rebound, so I took them off of any bindings to be safe from accidentally changing my dpi settings, so I can't say much about their quality or functionality.There are two additional buttons I did not use: one at the top left above the left mouse button, which usually just changed the color scheme of the mouse and worked when used but I never really used it. You can change the bindings to the button if I remember correctly which makes it a nice secondary button on the top left of the mouse, but I never bothered as it's a little too out of the way (my small hands would have to shift off the right mouse button to go far enough to press it comfortably)The other button is on the bottom of the mouse, and changes the mode of the mouse. Essentially, this just changes the dpi settings, and the color the mouse to match. I always kept this on the lowest setting as it was plenty high for me on that setting, and you can still adjust it more with your computers mouse settings. Despite it being on the bottom of the mouse, I had no issues with it being pressed accidentally.There is a panel on the bottom of the mouse, which you can open to reveal 7 weights which you can easily remove to change the feel of the mouse. They all pretty small and the mouse it very light without them, I ended up keeping them all in, and I would still consider it on the light side.Finally, the tracker is sealed, which is nice at not letting much hair or dust into the mouse, however this also means you cannot open the mouse in any way to clean any dust or hair out of it.As for what went wrong with the tracker... I don't know. Today the light just went out and moving the mouse no longer moved my cursor. All buttons worked, but not being able to move the cursor made that sort of pointless.It's very odd, it was working completely fine up until it didn't. I had no warning that it was going to stop working. It just suddenly doesn't. I rebooted my computer, unplugged and re-plugged in the mouse, and tried my best to clean out the mouse, but since it's sealed I don't think I did a very good job.For the price, I'd say it's a good mouse. For the sudden way it stopped working, I'd say keep a backup available.(fortunately I keep one for this very reason though the scroll wheel is finicky, but it's of a completely different brand.)I honestly liked this mouse and will probably order a new one, but if the same thing happens again I don't believe I will be purchasing another.If I can get the mouse working again, while I'll still order a new one, I'll come back and edit this review to say so.Edit: the new one arrived, when I plugged it in I noticed the profiles didn't save on the computer but seems to be linked to the mouse itself, I decided to plug in the old mouse to use the track pad on my laptop to save the profile on my computer, and suddenly it's working again. If it dies again, I'll edit this comment yet again but for the time being I'll be using the old mouse it looks like with a new one as a backup.Edit 2: Old mouse did it again only a few hours later. New one is out and will be used from here on out.

    The mouse feels good and robust. The software allows you to set up macros which is great, and you can control the mouse well enough even without the thumb, which makes using the buttons on the side easier.I have two relatively minor issues with it, which is that 1, the software distributed for the company appears to be different for each mice they sell instead of a single one that can recognize and manage all of them, which is weird but not that much of a big deal up to the moment you'll have to replace it with a better version, meaning you'll also need to uninstall the current software to install the new one. Really not that big a deal, just a bit annoying.The slightly bigger problem I found is that it doesn't work with my ergonomic mouse pad, which had me thinking the mouse was defective for a few minutes. I love that mouse pad, it's very comfortable and it worked with every mouse I've owned, even those that didn't work on my table, so this is extremely confusing... Probably means I won't be able to take my mouse with me, which is fine, the previous one still works and is lighter, but I'd rather not run my mouse on my table. Gonna need to go find one... So, if you have a soft ergonomic pad like those found in Best Buy or even here on Amazon, beware; chances are the mouse might not work on it.

    TL:DR, AMAZING warranty service. No B.S. 2 years is the minimum that you'll have a mouse for, unless you void the warranty.So, got this in April, had to return it shortly after because the wire was faulty and would disconnect with little movement. No fuss, only required an image of the bottom plate (which has not worn down in 9 months of daily use since)9 months later, and the wire has failed again. After a wonderful discussion with Kiara, where she explained why they did not stock the stiffer wire anymore, she has upgraded me to the wireless version. 11/10 customer service, above and beyond.You MAY also encounter a separate issue where the mouse may disconnect randomly, even without movement; there are two issues that could cause this.One: the software (not required, onboard memory, only required for initial setup.) doesn't always install right, perhaps? opening/reinstalling the software can fix this.Two: for whatever reason, it may not work well off of USB hubs: with the Redragon keyboard connected as well, they started failing twice as often. I took them off the hub, no further issues.

    This mouse is awesome. It is so comfortable and works great. I use it in Linux and configure it via a VM. The ergonomics are fantastic... The feel of the buttons, the scroll wheel is SOOO nice, the extra button next to left click, the thumb buttons... Gamer's paradise. Highly recommended.

    Coming from the Razer Naga line (multi-click issues with every single one), I think I have found a mouse that I can consider my new standard for gaming.If you’re also coming from Razer, this mouse feels a little bigger in your hand and it will take a little while to learn the num pad again. But it is totally worth it.I had an issue where the first one I bought was occasionally losing power and not working. Customer service could not be more stellar. I didn’t have to jump through any hoops before they decided to send me a replacement FAST.You don’t need to break the bank for a great mouse. Take the leap and buy this one! You won’t regret it.

    This mouse is so amazing I can not express my feelings enough how good it is. At first I thought it is on the large size (which is a bit) but I am also sort of big guy, so fits my hand perfectly. It is ultra light weight. with the mouse pad from SteelSeries also it is perfect match. The app is very straight forward to configure the mouse and speed scenarios, during the gaming and other usage you can easily change with one click, super easy.Now the downsides:Battery life is quiet short comparet to office type wireless mouses, heavy gaming like 10 hours a day lasted me 3 days, approx 30 hours :). Using it cable plugged actually didnt affect the steering too much, so most of the time using cable attached and for my friends I purchased 2 more non wireless version of this.Not sure if it is downside but since it is so lightweight, when you try to click side button which is up/down direction you can not hold the mouse stable, it moves, so lets say you are playing a shooter game, scope is open and want to use down button on the side, there is no way you will stay on target and press the down button at the same time.Over all, I am very happy with it, fits my hand perfectly, speed variations and smoothness is amazing, high quality with matching RGB with my SteelSeries keyboard, go for it...

    I am an avid player of First Person Shooter games (FPS) and as such I demand a low weight, high precision input device.  The Aerox 5 fits the bill for me.  I am coming from a pedigree of Basic Packard Bell (1990s) -> Microsoft Explorer -> Razer Deathadder -> G502 -> Glorious Model D Wireless -> Aerox 5.While I really enjoyed the Glorious Model D, I immediately missed the extra buttons from my G502.  I adjusted to the reduction in mouse buttons by grabbing a foot pedal for PTT voice comms (similar pedal: https://amzn.to/3VwdEuD) which turned out to be an amazing upgrade.The Model D only lasted a few months before the scroll wheel malfunctioned.  The wheel would randomly scroll causing me to weapon switch during intense left-click firefights. The right click mouse button also started sticking.So, looking for an upgrade, I stumbled upon the Aerox 5.The things that immediately drew me to the Aerox 5 were the 9 programmable buttons. I love that the mouse is an ultra light, weighing only slightly more than the Model D I was upgrading from. The mouse is pretty much perfect in every way, however there are a couple of annoying things I will point out here:1. The dongle is USB-C.  I do not have a USB-C port in my PC, so I was running the dongle with a long USB-A -> USB-C connection... until I stumbled upon the direct plug adapter (2nd pic).  You can get one of those here https://amzn.to/3GmkoH6.  I wish they had included one with the mouse.2. The mouse profiles in the SteelSeries GG software don't reliably automatically switch.  I have different profiles set up for each of my games with different button bindings and while the profile normally switches just fine, it's not 100% reliable.  Easy to fix.  I would recommend just having the 1 default profile and setting the extra mouse buttons to the NUMPAD keys and then change your key bindings in game accordingly. That way you don't have to mess with profile switching.  That's how I'll be setting it up once I reformat and lose these profiles.3. There is no DPI indicator light on the mouse that I can tell.4. The battery life is not the greatest but more than adequate.  It'll last 2 or 3 days before needing a charge.  I normally just connect it back up when I'm done playing and never really notice it.All in all, a great mouse and I highly recommend it.

    Love this mouse - it's about half the weight of my previous logitech mouse; and super comfy for long hours of gaming. Had it for a few months now and haven't had any issues at all. Clicks super nicely; is super reactive; and looks nice on the desk. Only tidbit is that you cant click the scroll wheel sideways to side scroll; so it's not much use for spreadsheets and the like! But my favorite mouse I have owned so far.

    I recently purchased a mouse from SteelSeries, and overall, it has been a solid performer. This review will provide an in-depth analysis of the product, highlighting its pros and cons.Pros:  Lightweight Design: The mouse is skeletonized, making it incredibly light. This feature contributes to enhanced maneuverability and reduces fatigue during extended gaming or work sessions. The lightweight nature of the mouse allows for swift and precise movements.  Eye-catching RGB Lights: The RGB lighting on the mouse is visually appealing and adds a touch of flair to your gaming setup. The vibrant colors and effects create an immersive experience, especially in a gaming environment. However, it's worth noting that the aesthetics might not be suitable for a professional work setting.  Thumb Buttons: The mouse boasts five conveniently placed buttons for the thumb. These extra buttons can be customized to suit your needs, providing quick access to macros or other functions. The intuitive placement of these buttons enhances gaming and productivity, allowing for seamless control and efficiency.  Excellent Supporting Software: SteelSeries provides downloadable software that complements the mouse perfectly. This software allows you to customize various aspects of the mouse, including DPI settings, button mapping, and RGB lighting effects. The extensive customization options ensure that the mouse can be tailored to your specific preferences and gaming style.Cons:  Awkwardly Placed Buttons: One notable drawback is that two of the mouse buttons are situated in unconventional locations, making them awkward to use. These buttons require pressing them either upwards or downwards, which can be uncomfortable and disruptive to your grip. As a result, some users, including myself, tend to avoid using these particular buttons altogether.  Gamer Aesthetic: The mouse design clearly leans towards a gamer-centric style. While this may be a positive aspect for gaming enthusiasts, it may not appeal to individuals seeking a more subtle or professional-looking mouse. The aggressive styling and RGB lighting might not blend well with a professional work environment.  Battery Life: The battery life isn't terrible but it's also not great. It does come with a fabric usb cable to charge it and it charges very fast, but the shorter battery life can be annoying if it dies while in use.In conclusion, the SteelSeries mouse offers several impressive features that make it a desirable choice for gamers and enthusiasts. Its lightweight design, customizable thumb buttons, and captivating RGB lighting add value to the overall user experience. Additionally, the supporting software provides extensive customization options.However, it's important to note that the placement of two buttons can be awkward, leading to discomfort and the potential for limited usage. Furthermore, the gamer aesthetic may not be suitable for everyone, especially those seeking a more professional-looking mouse.If you prioritize a lightweight and customizable gaming mouse and appreciate the visual appeal of RGB lighting, this mouse is worth considering. Just be aware of the potential button placement issues and ensure that the gamer-centric design aligns with your preferences and environment.

    Lightweight, works well wired and wireless.I mostly use it wired, so I don't notice the battery drain. It doesn't last too long wireless though. Maybe a day or two of being used. The wireless connection is very nice, and I don't notice any delay. It also doesn't disconnect on me while in use. The mouse comes with a usb-c to usb-a cable, usb-c wireless receiver, and a passthrough adapter for the receiver and cable. This is real nice for keeping the receiver close to the mouse in case you need to switch to wired for charging or switch back to wireless.The topmost side button works as two. Pushing up or pressing downward count as different buttons, and they can be configured in Steelseries GG. They are slightly awkward to use since it's a different motion than I'm used to, but the other side buttons work perfectly.The dpi button let's you switch between 5 pre-set options, but I changed these immediately in GG since they were too low or too high for my preferences.Overall it's a great mouse. Price is steep, but if you get it on sale, it is absolutely worth it. The biggest downside is using the GG software; however, I was already using it for Sonar and my keyboard, so I've learned to live with it.

    On day one of using this mouse I started experiencing issues with the 2.4GHz wireless connection randomly dropping for 5 to 10 seconds at a time. I switched over to using Bluetooth and it was also having issues with it losing the connection. I thought maybe it was an issue with my PC, but after troubleshooting with firmware updates, resetting to factory defaults, driver reinstalls, and BIOS updates I was still having the issue. On top of that I have other peripherals connected via 2.4GHz and Bluetooth that don't have any problems with their connections.After trying all the troubleshooting I figured it was faulty hardware so I opened a support ticket with SteelSeries. I gave them the purchase information and serial number they flat out said they would not help me because the mouse was ""still within it's return period with Amazon"". I told them I was aware that I could just return it, but that I had bought it on Black Friday which meant the return window was a few months away due to the holiday return policy. The only option I had was to return it (not exchange) and since the price had increased since I bought it I'd have to pay another $50 if I returned to rebuy it. They reiterated that they would not help and I could either return and rebuy it from Amazon or wait two months for SteelSeries to offer warranty support.At the end of the day I'm glad they didn't offer me support because while I was waiting for my return window to end I discovered the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro and it is SO MUCH BETTER. It may not be as lightweight, but it feels so much better in the hand and the responsiveness and button placement is top notch.Aerox 5 Wireless - 1/5 stars. Would not recommend.

    Tried several options for my weird grip (Claw/Palm) hybrid with small/medium hand, I wanted something to update my old g604, the closest I got was the Raid mouse from HyperX but that one isn't wireless and it didn't feel as accurate as the 604. I loved this one from SteelSeries though, it feels more accurate than the g604, the weight is amazing. Don't care much about the RGB but at least it turns off when you are using it. Don't like the tilt up down system of the top side button would rather have 2 regular buttons instead but at least it has 2 additional buttons, its not easy to find a light mouse with more than 2 side buttons these days. Regarding the grey aim button, I can't even reach it but it doesn't get in my way so I don't mind.Pros:Many buttons with great weightBluetooth optionPlastic feels niceSoftware is okScroll wheel reachableCons:Aiming grey button too far for small/med handTilting side button system instead of regular buttonBattery doesn't feel lasting 180Hrs

    Anecdote -- I got into SteelSeries because Logitech wasn't keeping up with the times, their software sucked, their products were boring. SteelSeries revitalized the industry when Razer got complacent and wasn't producing great products. You knew back then that if you got a steelseries it would last you forever with no problems with it. I don't know who I'm going to switch to next...What's good --Feel in the hand,Weight,Mouse Buttons,Responsive-ness whatever wireless tech they use is great.What's bad --Mousewheel failure -- they use a weird ratchet spring retention mechanism to track mousewheel scrolling and it does not stand the test of time. I've had this mouse for a year, and already it's failing. Down scrolls get measure as double up scrolls, mouse up scrolls get ignored. It's just not a good design.Maintenance -- it's impossible to take this mouse apart without breaking a few tabs. why... why is it needlessly difficult to take it apart.the Up/Down paddle on the left side -- most games don't recognize it's function so i have it bound to ""1"" and ""2"" for most applications. It's just weird... Hard to push up, easy to push down.Battery life sucks, i don't see why they could offer a larger battery / heavier weight variant ...

    I used this mouse for work and at home for 4 months. The mouse was great to use for the time that everything worked, but after the 4-month mark I started noticing that the scroll wheel wasn't scrolling in the direction I moved it consistently, and the left mouse button would occasionally register double-clicks when I was only single-clicking.I'm an avid PC user, so I bought this mouse as a replacement for an old SS mouse that was about 1-2 years old that had also started having these problems, as well as a replacement for the ~$10 mice that my workplace provides me whenever the last $10 mouse fails.I've had a lot of SteelSeries gear in the last 10 years, and while the headset and keyboard are still very solid, their mice have gotten significantly worse in terms of quality and reliability within the last 3-5 years.The fact that this mouse didn't last 4 months before it started showing problems already had me a bit shaken, but going to the SS website to ask for a replacement was the rest of the iceberg that I ran aground on that led me to give this 1 star. Upon opening the ticket, the person assisting me apologized that I was experiencing this issue and asked me to make a video recording of the problems with the scroll wheel and left mouse button using a website, and also wanted me to provide a picture of the serial number (even though I'd already provided the serial number with the ticket).I tried using the website provided to test the issue and make the recording, but the indicator that I was supposed to take a recording of on the site wasn't locked in place, so it was impossible to record while testing the scroll wheel.So they gave me a middling website to use to make a ""proof"" video of the specific issue I was having, and so I asked - rather nicely- that they address the issue on their own time and just send me a replacement. I'd already been stuck with a malfunctioning mouse for a month (at this point only ~5 months into owning it), so I didn't feel like leaping over hurdles or jumping through hoops to replace something that had a number of defects.But after doing this everything went south. The next response was a wall-of-text containing their RMA procedure, some legaleese about SS having the right to protect itself from fraudulent claims, further explanation as to why they needed pictures of the unit, the serial number (again), etc.I'd already provided the serial number when I submitted the ticket, as well as a picture of it and proof of purchase with the ""Please diagnose the issue on your own time."" response. So the legaleese that asked for both of these _again_ was clearly just copy-pasted by the rep and a further waste of my time.So I take a video of the malfunctioning mouse using a different website that could actually be recorded easily, took pictures of all sides of the unit, and gave them everything they asked for - including the items I had already provided. And the next response I got was another massive wall-of-text describing the steps I needed to go to in order for me to DESTROY the mouse before they even committed to an RMA replacement.So this person hadn't provided me with a replacement, or a coupon to be able to purchase a replacement unit through their website yet... but I was supposed to DESTROY the mouse that I still owned and used at home and at work before they sent me a replacement.Excuse me? You need me to destroy the $130 item I bought from you before you even commit to providing me a replacement? What in the absolute f*** kind of an RMA process is that?After further wasting my time scanning through the legaleese the rep responded with, the ""alternative"" is for me to BUY a new mouse from their website using a code they provide. And if I jump over all their hurdles and through the remainder of their hoops, then they just might refund me for the new mouse.The whole process feels like absolute codswallop. Maybe if they don't renege on their RMA once I have the new mouse I ordered with my own money in hand, I'll come back here and bump this up to 2 stars.Boy, do I sure love a company that makes me waste my time, makes no promises of following through on the RMA, and asks me to either destroy the thing I have or buy a brand new one just to finally have a chance at something that doesn't have defects. Gee, thanks SteelSeries!Update: I updated my review to 2 stars. After the original mouse was RMA'd, the second mouse also started having a slightly different problem about 3-4 months later. The middle mouse button click sometimes wouldn't register. I was able to RMA it again, and it went much faster this time since I knew they'd want video proof, pictures of the S/N, etc. But I'm now on my third one of these and hoping that this one doesn't also start experiencing similar problems by the time the warranty period has expired. Overall, the mouse itself is great. Having both a wireless dongle and bluetooth pairing option is extremely beneficial, but these issues with the mouse buttons starting to malfunction a few months in feels very anti-consumer.

    Pros:1. Wireless battery feels like it lasts forever.2. Lighting and RGB looks great.3. GG Engine is easy to use and program for the mouse and it's settings.4. Shape and design is visually appealing (preference).5. Moving from wired to Wireless mode is seamless and including cord is long as HECK.Cons:1. Scroll wheel tends to reverse imput often (try to scroll down and it will scroll up a bit at the same time as down). But I think this is an issue with just my mouse and 2 others I know with this mouse does not have this issue.2. I love the overall shape but the large silver thumb button feels just to far away to be useful or easy to press when needed in the heat of a game.3. The thumb button up/down motion is great in theory however the down press at times can be hard to trigger causing clicks to do nothing if you are not in the right spot, and the up button is also difficult as its so easy to click mouse 4 while trying to push up on the flip button.Overall I really like this mouse, it satisfied my need for a few extra buttons to use during gamming without getting a full 12 button MMO mouse which is just too many buttons for me. With a few adjustments I feel like this could be a near perfect mouse for me in the future.

    This mouse is fast and floats on the pad, and is lightest mouse with 3 side buttons i could find, and i love it, its a heavy pricetag for a mouse, but if your a hardcore gamer like I am in FPS and looters shooters especially, this mouse performs excellent. It's about the same size as logitech g502 heroI bought it because it was on sale for 100$ I was going to get the Glorious O 2 wireless super light (but they only have 2 side buttons) or the Glorious model I 2 MMO wireless but was a little heavier and reviews about the side buttons made me weary (They are both around 100$ but usually has a discount of 10/20%)I'm glad I got this one and have no buyers remorse. I mainly play Escape from Tarkov, and many other games that require to many keybinds that if you don't have more then 2 side mouse buttons you're breaking your left hand with all the combination key binding (pressing multiple keys to perform action) as use my side mouse button for leaning I need thar extra trigger for toggling and combo hot keying it with a keyboard bind.The battery seems decent enough to last a few days of constant playing and use, I use my PC for work as well as gaming so I definitely probably drain a battery faster then most, and the fact you can charge and use wired is great as well.The only con I see is the price which if if you catch a sale isn't bad, the Steel Series proprietary software that pushes a Ad page every time you open is to adjust settings (i really hate when companies do this like i bought your stuff let me use it without tryin to push more stuff) the fact you can't seen the RGB lighting when your using it (which isn't really a problem for me since u dont care but figured someone might think it is)All and all I love this mouse very much and can't recommend it enough.

    For the most part, it's been a fantastic addition to my gaming setup. It performs admirably, providing precision and speed that enhance my gaming experience.The ergonomic design of the mouse fits comfortably in my hand, and the customizable buttons have been a boon for my gaming sessions. It's been a joy to use for gaming-related functions.However, there is one notable drawback that I've encountered, especially for Mac users. The hotkey binding for Mac does not work as expected. I tried to bind the side key with the Mac mission control shortcut, but despite my efforts, I was unable to get it to function correctly. Even after downloading the SteelSeries app to customize the mouse's settings, the issue persisted.Despite this setback, the mouse's primary gaming performance remains top-notch, and it has certainly improved my gaming experience.

    I come from using a much heavier mouse so switching to this ultra light-weight mouse is taking some getting used to. Tinkering with the engine settings in the GG app is a must to get your CPI settings right.I really like the button placement, though the 7-8 can be a bit awkward since they are up and down rather than push in. The 9 button is placed a little further out so it prevents accidental presses which was a major problem with my previous mouse. I *highly* recommend using a mouse bungee to keep your cord off the desk because of the weight of the mouse. Otherwise the tiniest bit of drag from the cord can affect your aim or move the mouse.As far as keeping it clean, I use a can of compressed air to blow it out every couple of days because my place is a dust factory. I wear compression gloves so getting oils on the open parts of the mouse aren't an issue, and a simple wipe of the buttons with an alcohol prep pad takes care of the buttons.In terms of playing games until you dial in those CPI settings you may have some issues with your aim, especially if you are doing fast-twitch things like FPS. However being able to create profiles for programs is very useful, even if you have to actually know where your program is located to select the executable file to make one. It does switch seamlessly when you click in and out of programs so there's a definite plus. Unfortunately there aren't any built-in integrations with programs like Discord so you'll have to rely on setting up keys with program hotkeys.The RGB settings aren't the most advanced and a bit difficult to set up in comparison to other devices I've used. If that's super important to you you may not be happy with this, but for me personally I'm not bothered.In summary, it's a good mouse, and if you can pick it up on sale like I did it's well worth it. Keep in mind this is a really light mouse and there will be an adjustment period if you're coming from something heavy. Setting it up with the software takes a bit more know-how than other programs for other brands.

    The mouse is pretty lightweight, which I'm not used to, so it took a while to get accustomed to it. The left and right mouse buttons were extremely sensitive the first two or three weeks, so I was accidentally clicking frequently when I didn't mean to. It seemed to just be a break-in period because almost 2 months in and it's much better now.My only issue is that the battery life doesn't seem to match the 180+ hour that was marketed, though even the marketing is inconsistent. The listing title states 180+ hours, but the product details states up to 180 hours. If I unplug the mouse to use it wirelessly, it maybe lasts 48-60 hours before it flashes red to indicate it needs to be plugged in. I initially thought it might have just been flashing red as a normal part of it switching colors, until it disconnected several minutes later until I charged it for a while. There's software that lets you turn off the RGB to extend the battery life, but I'd rather play with the RGB, it's just the product details could be a bit more transparent on what we can expect battery life-wise.

    This gaming mouse had me swooning at first glance. The ergonomic design cradled my hand like a glove, the buttons danced under my fingertips with satisfying clicks, and the wireless freedom felt like shackles cast off. I was a gaming ninja, a pixelated warrior unleashed.But then, the battery life reared its ugly head. Like a party guest who overstays their welcome, it lingered, draining the energy and excitement from every session. A casual hour of slaying dragons? Nope, gotta plug it in halfway through. An intense competitive match? Pray to the tech gods that it lasts.Don't get me wrong, the features are fantastic. The sensor is a precision beast, tracking my every twitch with laser-like focus. The side buttons are a macro maestro's dream, letting me unleash complex combos with a single squeeze. And the RGB lighting? A symphony of customizable colors that would make any unicorn envious.But all the bells and whistles can't mask the constant drumbeat of impending battery death. It's like having a Ferrari with a fuel gauge that's permanently stuck on ""E."" The thrill of the ride is constantly tempered by the fear of running out of gas.So, to the aspiring gamer considering this mouse, I say tread carefully. If you're a casual warrior, content with short bursts of pixelated glory, it might be a decent fit. But for the die-hards who crave hours of uninterrupted domination, look elsewhere. This sleek beauty ultimately falls short in the marathon, leaving you stranded and frustrated (and possibly reaching for the dreaded wired backup).Pros:Ergonomic designHyper-responsive sensorCustomizable buttons and RGB lightingWireless freedom (for a while)Cons:Abysmal battery lifeConstant charging anxietyNot for marathon gaming sessionsOverall: A potentially amazing mouse crippled by a power problem. Consider your gaming habits carefully before taking the plunge.

    Only real problem I had was trying to change the lighting settings, and it would save them, when the mouse would go into rest mode it would lose the lighting settings, but after a few searches I figured it all out and got it working right. Haven’t used the double up/down button on the side yet, never been a big mouse button user, but clicking it down isn’t the easiest, up is fine and I’d rather have it as an option then not, and may use it as a macro button.I know some have complained about battery life, this is my first wireless gaming mouse, and it’s not too bad, get 3+ days with the lighting turned off, and worst comes to worst you can plug it in and use it like a normal mouse, and it charges to 50%+ in under 30 mins.

    Overall, a great mouse. Light, though not quite as light as some of the competition. Trading off more weight for more buttons and better ergonomics is worth it to me as it is a very comfortable mouse to use (coming from a Rival 600 it's nearly identical in shape), and the number of extra side buttons (5 + 1 top) is very convenient. Have also not noticed any additional input lag in wireless dongle mode vs wired (haven't tried bluetooth).Battery life has been fine. Not great, not terrible. When used as a daily driver, I can get about 3 days out of it (mixed use work + gaming). When used only after-work basically just for a couple hours of gaming a day, I get about 5 days.I will say it was annoying to get the thing paired to my PC with the little receiver dongle. You really do have to use the same cable for charging and the receiver dongle to get the best results.

    The mouse itself gets a 4.5/5 star for me. Great feel to it (claw grip). Great pads, very smooth, switches/scroll wheel feel amazing and it’s light. (Have yet to test battery life). The software gets a 1/10 lol. It’s the worst mouse software I’ve used, between Corsair, Logitech, and even red dragon. Bringing the average overall to a 3. ITS CRAZY, imagine having an amazing product, and the im giving it a 3 over your software? The software is steel series GG. It operates as a game capture software, aim trainer, add platform for their products, etc.. It does everything but be a good mouse software. It constantly runs in the background, even if you turn off game capture/auto clips it still pops up with the overlay in every game. My BIGGEST complaint about it is I have played on 850 dpi my whole life. This is the first mouse EVER that I can’t. Their software dpi editing only operates in 100 increments, so you either could do 800 or 900 but not 850. That may sound crazy to you but when you’ve played on a sensitivity for 17 years, it matter. That reason alone I will be returning it. Last issue that really bothers me, is the rgb settings, for the mouse? You can set them, but it DOESNT EVEN WORK LOL. Very common complaint I have seen here but I thought it may just be intermittently working. Nope it just doesn’t work at all and the rgb does it’s own thing. STEEL SERIES YOU HAVE AN AMAZING MOUSE, FIX YOUR SOFTWARE.

    I moved up from Aerox 3 and it was the best decision. I've got slightly larger than average hands with longer fingers and this mouse fits perfectly. Software is intuitive and doesn't require you to create an account in order to have access to it (looking at you, razer).I have all of the illumination turned off to save battery life and it lasts plenty of time.I wish this had a wireless charging capability, as plugging it in once in a while does get a bit old.Overall: 5 out 5!

    Maybe it's just me, I have a different mouse that currently allows me to add weights if needed. Perhaps that has skewed my judgement on this however, the weight of this mouse is super light, the cursor (even with adjusting sensitivity to the lowest setting my my computer) is really speedy. Makes playing shooter games a little harder to play when the mouse is that sensitive. There aren't any other settings that I can see to change. I liked the idea of the holes for your palm to breath though. That is a great concept

    I've used this mouse little over one month now. Overall, this mouse is pretty light and decent itself for gaming. But then I am not sure if only mine does this, the left click doesn't work sometimes. I need to click it with little more power than any other mouse I've used.I was too lazy to return and get new one, then after a month, I am just used to it so doesn't bother me much . Since right click doesn't have problem, I guess only mine is defect one.Thou, I would recommend this mouse if you prefer light weight mouse.

    The mouse worked great for the first few months. However, the battery started to not last as long after a full charge. I began to have connection issues where it would just turn off, and then back on. I'm not sure If I maybe got a bad mouse, but its usability went down fast. It wasn't a computer software issue as I tried it out on multiple computers.It slipped off my desk onto the tile and landed on the skeleton backing, it cracked, and decided to buy a new mouse.Overall it's not bad, I would just recommend buying a different brand mouse.

    Update: After using the mouse continually for a few days, I've been able to adjust some to the honey comb on the clicking surfaces (without using tape). Adding one star as I've enjoyed the mouse more since the initial review, but still not a sound design decision for future models.---- original review ---I just received both the Aerox 5 and 9 for prime day with the intent of playing high APM games like StarCraft II. Unfortunately right off the bat I can tell they may have to be returned, as the honey comb extends too far into the mouse buttons to the point that it digs into your fingers when clicking frequently. I don't know if my hands are just too small (I think they are average medium size) or that I use more than just the tip of my fingers to click, but as an ergonomic mouse the entire button click surfaces should *always* be completely solid and comfortable. (I understand the goal to save weight, but the extra 1g is definitely not worth it.)For now I have taped over the portion of the honey comb on the left/right click buttons, which is pretty janky to have to do at this price point. Nonetheless the rest of the mouse is nice as you'd expect; I'll be seeing if I can live with the tape, else they'll be returned.

    There are many imitators of this mouse from the Glorious Gaming one to many others, but none will match the original. By far the best looking mouse on the market, and decent customizability on the RGB effects, but no segmentation. Truly amazing waterproofing! Will withstand any amount of direct spills of water despite all the holes it seems to have. The battery lasts a few days, which is better than some but not close to others that last months (though without RGB effects.) I'd say it's worth about half the listed price, if you can get it from Amazon Warehouse in good condition or catch a deal.

    They make a terrible keyboard but this mouse is amazing. At least they managed to get something right! The only thing I don't like is how cheap the scroll wheel feels. Which was an odd choice because the rest of the mouse feels premium.

    Let me start by saying how much I love Steelseries products. I have, and use daily, an Apex Pro and Arctis Nova Pro. My mouse before this one was an Aerox 5 wired and I really liked that mouse but wanted to ditch the wire. So I figured the wireless version would be perfect and I would love it as much as all the other Steelseries peripherals I have purchased. Unfortunately I was very, very wrong.First off, the positives, of which there are a few. It fits my hand perfectly which I often have a hard time with as my hand tends to be too big for smaller mice but too small for bigger mice. The weight was really good for me too. There are plenty lighter mice but this was right about where I like it to be and the materials feel good as well and not super cheap or flimsy. All the buttons feel good too without feeling squishy.Unfortunately that about does it for the positives, so here come the issues I had with it in the almost 6 months of daily use I've put it through. The battery life is abysmal and borders on false advertising with what they state it is. I had to charge it every day and ended up having to use it plugged in quite often, which obviously completely defeats the purpose of a wireless mouse. It's supposed to be better on Bluetooth but that's because it locks a very low polling rate and disables many features available on 2.4g.It would also constantly disconnect or fail to reconnect after going to sleep, which I have found many complaints about from others who have had the misfortune of purchasing this mouse as well. The final straw was the mouse cursor lagging almost like the sensor was cutting out on long sweeps. As of now it's barely usable less than 6 months after purchase so I'm replacing it with a Logitech.I still have a strong affinity for Steelseries but I think I am going to skip their mice until they start making better ones. The wireless Aerox mice seem to be a problem for many who buy them and I haven't seen any comment or even acknowledgment from Steelseries at all, which isn't a good look. Maybe I just got a bad one, which is entirely possible, but I still absolutely cannot recommend this mouse to anyone.

    Connects fast and love being able to have it connected USB wireless to my PS5, Wired to Mac, and Bluetooth to iPad with a flick of a switch. When on my computer, the GG app lets me switch profiles based on app open and using to make accessing macros and game specific custom controls adds another layer to the joy.CPI button quickly adjust speed which is handy when going between a 50” screen for PS5 and Mac and shifting to a much smaller iPad Pro where a lower CPI helps a lot.

    I've been looking for a general mouse to replace my old HyperX Pulsefire. This mouse is great (can be wired, wireless or bluetooth) so I can connect it to a few computers. It has 3 stars because:1. It is really fragile, especially the side button that clicks up and down. That button popped out of place on an unfortunate tumble off the ergo mouse tray and stayed on a click down position. Luckily you can ignore that button in the Steelseries GG software2. It is very hard to take the mouse apart. It doesn't pop out like other mice when you remove the bottom screws. It looks like just the entire bottom plate comes off but it is the bottom plate + the right side of the mouse together. If you try to pop the bottom plate off by itself, you'll break 2 really thin pieces of plastic held by small screws that you can't really see. Since the mouse is lightweight, Steelseries opted for very thin plastic that will snap if you bend it a tad too far. 18 screws later and 4 broken retention clips, I was able to redo the side button and put the mouse back mostly together. It still works. Some of the screws are hidden behind other plastics and the bottom mouse PCB so you'll need a very thin Philips screwdriver for that.

    Es un mouse excelente para los juego que prefiero (fps de supervivencia, tácticos y mmo rpg).Es muy ligero, la batería día unos 3 días aproximadamente ( 8 horas por día), a mí parecer la carga de la batería es rápida. Lo malo es que las luces consumen mucha batería.El software es un poco complicado pero tiene bastantes opciones y funciona bien.La construcción del mouse de siente un poco frágil, pero no me ha dado problemas. El botón que está frente al pulgar es un poco incómodo de usar, pero eso evita que lo presiones sino querer. Es un mouse para una mano de 17cm o mayor.

    I love this company- the other products of theirs I have are just top tier. This mouse also seems well made and is exceptionally light, and the design seems great for keeping your hands from getting sweaty. BUT the forward thumb button is not a DPI clutch. It looks like one. It’s where one should be. But it is not a DPI clutch, and there is no setting to make it one. This isn’t a huge deal if you aren’t used to playing with a DPI clutch, but if you are used to it and expecting it, this product is a disappointment. For a company that otherwise makes top tier gaming mice, it seems like a weird detail to overlook, and honestly, it might be an easy fix on the software side to just add DPI clutch as an optional functionality. It’s on me for not reading up more on the mouse before I bought it, but again, I have come to expect cutting edge from this company, so that lack of functionality was just something I expected… especially because the button is right there! I really hope this is a feature they add later, because I want to give this thing an honest try. Please add DPI clutch functionality to what could definitely be a top-tier peripheral!

    To save you time from reading my rant the 4 main take aways are: The scroll wheel is a common issue with all of their mice (Experienced it with 2 aerox, 1 prime, and 3 rivals). The quality for the price isn't up to par, the battery life is overstated, and the RMA process needs improvement.I felt this mouse was a little over priced compared to the quality I've received from other brands at this price point. I'd compare it to the quality of the Glorious brand mice, which is exactly where this one landed for me.I've been a loyal customer to steel series for some time, partly because I didn't know as much about computer accessories as I do now. From dealing with them over the years, I've noticed a downward trend in quality and customer service all while keeping premium pricing.From the 2 aerox that I've owned, the scroll wheel encoder has been the main issue from what I can tell. When scrolling down or up, the wheel tends to bounce back and forth between directions. This can be frustrating in game when changing camera zoom or weapons, as well as simply surfing the internet. The problem existed from the start with both of them, but I waited until it was completely unbearable to see if RMA'ing would be worth it. This is where the experience really changed my opinion about steel series.In order to process the RMA, they make you jump through various loops with there super generic scripts that are meant to make you feel like they care, all though it's more like they're not even listening. Following all the trouble shooting and submitting the personal info to process an RMA, they then tell you that your RMA is pending but they want you to either destroy the product and send evidence of it destroyed, or pay to send it back to their facility so they can then send you a new unit. This means you'd have to go without a mouse for some time, and potentially dish out money to get a replacement that is likely to show up with the same issue.

    Tried razer, logi, glorious, Asus,cooler master,and some others I gave this mouse a try and the shape fits my hand and does not cause it to cramp up after a few hours of use. It is light but doesn't feel cheap. The main buttons feel decent and the scroll wheel clicks and feel good. The side buttons are ok, a bit close together for thumb use , but functional with a bit of wobble as well as pre and post travel. The glides are average like what you would expect to get with any mouse in the price range. I traded them out for some glass glides from Pulsar and use it on a fnatic XL desk mat.The sensor is good although sometimes the the input lag doesn't always catch some of the rapid clicking when you already have one of the main buttons pressed, I brought this up in an email to there support a month ago but have no heard anything back. I wish the tracking was a little faster and smoother but understand that the firmware for the price point can only do so much.

    I’ll start with the knot picky cons first then work my way to the few pros of this disappointing purchase .  Firstly the mouse feet are hands down the worst I’ve encountered in years and would need replaced with third party feet right away as they literally grind on my pad, again steel series falls short on a major feature as they did on their Arctis Nova Pro ear pads . Next the weight , it’s very bottom heavy which I will assume is due to the RGB having defusers placed over them which is nice but not needed . And adds extra drag , now here comes another big no no they for some unknown reason on a “Wired” mouse added a detachable usb c cable it stay tightly attached but the paracord is stiff and heavy even on a bungee I felt very tethered and restrained no matter what I did . Also denounce timing cannot be adjusted via the software and it preset in the firmware is terrible Steel Series needs to unlock this in an update for the users and update the software allowing them to adjust it as they see fit.  Now to the few pros , if you like RGB it looks nice and GG has lots of nice apps for RGB blah blah blah… oh wait that’s it? Yep!  In short buy a better priced mouse like one of the line up from Glorious , if you want to spend this much buy one from Pulsar .

    The hardware and form factor are fine enough.But oof, the software!The “SteelSeries GG” setup software is master software that apparently services and hawks all the different types of SS peripherals - mice, keyboards, headsets, speakers - and also peripheral apps that also get installed with the GG software.If you look hard enough you can find in that mish-mash the tabs to click to access your mouse setup facility.The GG software install wants you to set up an account with SteelSeries in order to complete the install.  If you are careful, you can install without making an account, but it is suggested that you will have diminished functionality.The GG software install defaults to always starting on system bootup.  This switch, if you can find it, can be turned off, but there will be a scary message that you will be missing out on functionality.An account with SS and always on software, especially for just a mouse, well. that smells like data mining.  And the terms and conditions bear that out.I am used to sometimes opaque mouse setup software with other brands, but the GG software takes the cake.  I fell into a deep time sink when I discovered that the custom profile color setups that I had created for my mouse (Basic Desktop and Gaming) worked no more and only the default color scheme was operational.After much sturm and drang, I finally figured out that in the “Prism” color facility within GG if you simply click the box acknowledging the existence of your particular mouse, as one will do, that it then overrides whatever configuration color setups you created in the “Gear” setup facility and only the default setup can be used.  Evidently, there are two color setup facilities within GG, and they do not cooperate.

    This mouse has a defective scroll wheel controller , apparently a common problem according to the forums.  It randomly doesn't register the wheel while scrolling or randomly registers  in the opposite direction.  I had to disable smooth scrolling altogether  in order to have any kind of response from the wheel.  As long as you do not rely on the scroll wheel the rest of the mouse is quite alright, light and responsive.  And the flick switch is really useful in MMO and RPG style games.  I do like the feel of the mouse, and have been using it for over a year now.  It would be damn near perfect if they can fix the scroll wheel.Another problem with this mouse is the non existent  Linux support.  Which requires me to use third party hacks to be able to access the button and RGB  lighting profiles.  However the mouse does have onboard memory and so I am able to reuse my button profile across multiple operating systems.  A custom RGB lighting scheme  still requires background software to run, which I really do not like.

    So the only things that I cant complain about is that this mouse looks beautiful and is super lightweight. But, that is where the good stuff stops. My mouse's scroll wheel is completely broken. It will scroll up randomly while I scroll down and vise versa so, in videogames, I can never select the right item with the scroll wheel. The wireless capabilities stopped working almost completely about a year into use also (which is why I am writing this review) . I am a bit disappointed this happened because this mouse really looks good and is super lightweight. Another minor thing is that it isn't the most comfortable mouse to hold. I have had a bit better but man, kinda sad it sucks. Not recommended.

    Sturdy, like the texture feel, large gliders, excellent weight and button response.  I moved from the Glorious model O and D, these are good mice but the left click was not always positive.  The left click on this Aerox 5 is superior, precise, and 100% responsive.  I like the extra programable buttons, their placement taking some getting used to, but work very well.  The less gaudy RGB is appreciated, as is the curser accelleration/decelleration in software, but the best thing is the PRECISE button feel/response of all the switches!!!  They should make a slightly smaller version.

    It’s a great mouse in every way. Love the dual connectivity, only issue is the clutch, DPI shift thumb button on the side is slightly too far forward and requires a small hand position adjustment to reach. I have large hands too so I was surprised. All else aside it’s a great mouse.

    Don't let my headline confuse you, I love this mouse! I just feel like most tech that it's priced WAY higher than what it's probably worth. Buuut! Other than the high price tag I gotta say that there's nothing not to like about it! It's lightweight, very responsive, NO rubber grips and it has a very accessible set of side buttons! On the thought of the side buttons I mentioned in my headline that the mouse is unique. Now what makes it unique? The um... Flipper(???) side button! Just above the two standard side buttons is a single button or switch that you can flick up or down for separate actions! This is freaking awesome for anyone that wants more key-binds on their mouse without speckling said mouse with a ton of tiny buttons.

I like crossing my legs and sitting in weird positions and this chair has enough room to allow for my weird habits. Most chairs I’ve owned typically last about a year before signs of defects start to show.My only concern is in the photos attached. I was suppose to bolt in the back plate for the back rest but there were no bolt holes? Come to find out there were bolt holes to screw the bolts in but I had to puncture the leather with a knife so I could screw them in where they were suppose to go. This by itself was really weird to me as I wasn’t sure if the intentional design from factory or not? If so, this is pretty inconvenient cause I wasn’t sure if that was what I was suppose to do and no where in the instructions did it talk about this.So far this one seems to be built well and made to last. I definitely recommend this chair for daily gaming use.

    So I work from home and needed a chair that was comfy and would hold up.  I'm 6'1"" and 250 lbs so I wanted a chair that was not at ""max weight"" when I used it.  I looked at a lot of chairs at various prices and decided this was my last shot at a chair under $200.Package came 4 days early and was well packaged. Instructions were very clear and package came with extra hardware in case you lost a bolt or washer which is nice. The wheels are smooth and of higher quality than other chairs I've used. The plastic parts are very dense and of high build quality. Everything about this chair screams STURDY.  I've only sat in the chair for a few hours but I can honestly say this thing has no wiggle room and seems like it will last.Now to my only con for this chair and the reason I didn't give 5 stars. The cushioning in the chair is really really stiff. I'm hopeful this will change over time but the first hour of me sitting in this chair wasn't the most comfortable. I going to say you need to ""break in"" this chair.TLDR:  Great packaging, easy to assemble (took 20-25 minutes), super sturdy, build quality is amazing, stitching is on point, and looks great.  Cushions are solid but in a stiff way.  Not like memory foam.Think like an overfilled cushion to the point of bursting.  Hoping it breaks in over time.

    It was decently easy to assemble. Part of the instructions for the arms might be a little confusing but overall the construction is intuitive. I read some reviews that the seat might be a bit hard but so far no complaints. I also got a cushion for back support. The chair comes with it's own pillow for back support but that was actually quite tough material, so I just left it off. Overall good sturdy chair.

    Recently got this chair to replace an old unrelated model gaming chair. This chair gives you every bang for your buck, it’s super comfortable, and offers great support. All aspects of the chair check off for an all around great gaming chair. Super happy with it.

    Back support is great! And so is the ability to adjust the angle of how the chair sits and I love the head pillow. Has really helped with my strained neck because my posture would make a goblin cry. However, two things: 1, the footrest isn't awful but definitely not great. The bars holding it feel extremely flimsy and like they could break rather easily if actual pressure is applied. Doesn't seem well balanced beneath the chair. I try to be careful with mine if I do actually use it (I rarely do). And 2, which is arguably of utmost importance when looking for a gaming chair, the butt seat can become insufferably uncomfortable after a while; it could definitely use more padding for those who sit for long hours. ): My butt be aching! I've had mine for a couple months now and quality seems great overall. Just the cheek comfort needs more to it. Highly recommend a squishy pillow or two!

    This chair did not hold up. Purchased this in July and gave to my son in August for his birthday. The arm rests quickly came apart and the foam fell out and just this week the arm completely broke off so I will be disposing of the chair. For the price I would expect it to last more than 4 months. Seat cushion also hard and not comfortable to sit on. Do not recommend!

    I am sitting 7-9 hours a day at a computer so I was looking to upgrade my seat.  Mainly I was focused on something economical with a head rest.  This, for $120 seemed a decent option.  Prior reviews looked okay.  I am a big guy, 6'1"" 270 and it is rated for 350 lbs.  The assembly took 30 minutes.  The product is mostly plastic and I am guessing it will last maybe 6 months with my heavy use so disappointed there.  The headrest does work which is the primary reason for this purchase.  But after half a day I find the seat uncomfortably stiff but maybe over time, I will get used to the difference from my last chair.  It is wider than the chair I replaced.  You get what you pay for I guess.  Maybe spending twice as much would have been advisable for more ergonomic comfort and longevity.  I do not plan to use the leg rest as my desk is not deep enough.  You do not need to install it if you do not want it.

    This is a good chair for the cost.Pros:Well built and easy to assemble.ReclinesLumbar support pillow is greatComfyConsLeg rest is short and I’m only 5’ 8” so if you’re any taller it would be unusableDoesn’t recline quite as far as I would likeHead support pillow is good but the strap is a terrible design. The strap hooks are one up and one down which always causes the strap to come undone because it really doesn’t fit the chair all that well.All in all it’s a good chair but if you came hardcore I would spend a bit more.

    Upon first opening the box and pulling out the parts, I was rather impressed by the weight of the pieces and the quality. My excitement quickly turned around when I started assembling it and realized the holes were not located correctly for the screws to fit in. I ended up also discovering that the screws given to me had already been used or manufactured wrong as the threads were stripped and not usable. Fortunately they provide extra parts to use such as screws but was not enough for all the ones that I had with issues. When building it, it took me about an hour trying to get everything screwed in dealing with the screw holes not located correctly. I ended up having to not put in all the screws that the directions called for because of this. After finishing the installation I was throughly impressed with the build and stability of it however some parts such as the arm rests and the adjustment  levels looked either used or very defective with scratches and dents in them. Overall I feel as though I received a high quality USED chair with the amount of wear on certain pieces and assembly issues. I think this product is good and possibly received a bad apple product but I am not satisfied to my expectations given the amount of money it costed.

    I have had this chair around a week now and one of the wheels fallen off 5 times. Each wheel assembly pressed fine into its socket, but caster actually has 2 wheels - an inner and outer. At least once a day one of the wheels just falls right off. It presses back in fine, but I know it will continue. This part of the caster is pre-assembled from the factory. Also, the chair is rather stiff. While some may like this type of cushion, I prefer something a bit softer. I know this is preference, but I figure it's worth mentioning. I made sure that all bolts/screws were properly tightened, but this thing pops and creaks worse than any office/gaming chair I have ever owned. I am going to re-tighten all the hardware and hope that helps. My advice? Steer clear and go with something of higher quality. I would return it but trying to haul around and return something of this size and weight will be a nightmare. I have had chairs half this price last nearly 10 years...I'm one week in. I am going to attempt to contact customer support to see if they will send me a new caster and will update how the customer experience goes accordingly.

    I did not personally use this product as it was a birthday gift. Evidently the instructions were clear as my inexperienced 16-year-old grandson was able to put it together all by himself (without any leftover parts, I might add). Lol. It seems to be holding up well under the use of a rambunctious teenage boy.

    I have had this chair for a while now.  It works.  It's not the most comfortable chair I have ever used.  I'm thinking it needs an extra seat cushion.  For the price it's pretty good compared to how much you can spend on high end game chairs.

    Really wanted to like this chair and tried several different sessions to see if I could make this work.But even with the little lumbar cushion it includes, my lower back just wouldnt have it. Not sure if it's the stiffness or the design of the chair itself. But If you're wanting to use this for extended sessions (work or gaming), just be warned, your back will start complaining. That said, I won't in good conscience recommend this chair for anyone over the age of 18yrs.

    I didn't expect a lot from this chair but it really impressed me for the price. I find that most chairs sell you on their comfort but this one is very easy on your bottom. The support on my back is very good as well (I am 5'9""). Like use armrests a lot and most have left my elbows sore after hour. I don't have that problem with this chair. I've been burned by the claims of other chairs as being ergonomic and comfy  and so far I have found that this chair, out of the other chairs I have purchased (around the same price point) have let me down.  I would recommend this chair  to anyone looking for a very good chair for a really good price.

    I like this chair and was comfortable up until a couple weeks ago. The seat padding has gone away and I'm now sitting on the hard base.

    The screws holding the base of the chair to the vertical support of the chair creak and loosen every time I move in the chair. If I just slightly lean back on the chair, I hear the screws loosening with a loud clicking sound. Every week or so I have to tighten the screws again. I'm not doing any crazy movements in the chair either, I'm just using it like a chair should be used, yet after just 3 weeks, if I move my body to the side to reposition myself or get more comfortable in the chair, I can hear the springs in the base of the chair clinking. I fear in the next month or so something is gonna fall apart or break in this chair, and if that happens I will request for a refund. I recommend anyone to save up the money to buy a more quality chair.

    Been sitting on a Respawn gaming chair now for a few years, it was like sitting on plywood at that point. I'd been shopping around for a bit, off and on, for another chair. Kinda didn't want to give up a limb for a decent chair, but it seems those days are gone (the respawn chair cost 125-ish).So after a bit of looking around, I decided to choose this chair. Now, I didn't choose this chair for the bluetooth speakers (I literally didn't realize it had any until after the fact), I chose it for the lumbar support and the color.Fast forward to this past Saturday, and I had it assembled. Took about an hour, and the pictograms didn't help all that much. Pretty intuitive though, just had to make sure you had the right bolts. Do yourself a favor and have a cordless drill with a hex head onhand for running them in, and hand tighten for the finishing touch. Once that was all done, I sat down and was pleasantly surprised to find it was firm, but flexible. I'm sure though in a couple years it'll wear out but for now, win!So, next step since at that point I realized it had bt speakers, was to TRY to get windows to sync with it AND my desktop setup. Yeah that didn't work out so well. Windows sees the speakers, but it won't allow the mixer to sync with the desk ones. I have zero clue as to why. Went on YT and all kinds of forums for an answer, and walkthroughs... Nadda. Just doesn't work on my rig. But since i'm running 5.1 surround, its not a HUUUGE deal. This chair would be perfect for someone with a laptop, or console, or just needing speakers. My phone found the speakers as well, so it's phone supported.Now the speakers aren't super good. And if you want that kind of sound quality, pop them out and replace them with alpine, klipsch, etc etc and go with that. But they aren't terrible either. They're in my opinion a mid range quality speaker. Helpful tip: they run off their own power supply, and have 2.5mm jacks to plug into. Recharging is done via usb-c, and takes about 1.5hrs to fully charge it. I have no idea how long the battery lasts, but given the size of the battery box, and weight, i'd say not too long.So, the best redeeming quality I found was in fact, the comfort. I've sat in this now for 2+hrs and have fallen asleep. This isn't me being tired or whatnot, it's just that its surprisingly comfortable. First time, I reclined in it while listening to some Low Roar, and was gone within the hour. Had the back portion reclined, no footrest extended. Woke up 2hrs later, wasn't kinked up or anything. Second time, I had it slightly reclined, and was just reading emails on my phone and off I went again. About 2hrs later I wake up, back still doing ok. Still didn't use the footrest. At some point in time, I gotta try that part out, If I can stay awake long enough lol.So i'm going to say, its worth the $ if you want something like this but don't want to spend a mortgage on a high quality seat. It's comfy, doesn't take forever to construct, has built in speakers that aren't terrible, and the quality is there. So, what're you waiting for? Buy with confidence!

    Without a doubt it is comfortable and looks great, once it is assembled.  The assembly instructions not so simple though. Although I assembled it by myself after half a day's work, but I am 90 years old and not so easy getting around.  Some of the metal (prethreaded) screw holes were not properly aligned and one even had damaged threads which made it even more difficult. Be prepared to have a few extra tools to help and some thread tape to put on some of the screws to get a better trheaded connection if you want a good fit.  a battery powered drill is also very helpful.  Also watch the assembly videos on Youtube. The directions leave a lot to be desired. For instance, I had the most problems with the foot rest and the arm rest due to screw and screw hole problems, and the directions are incomplete. Directions say (with not so clear drawings)  ""Install the mechanism and foot rest rails"" that's it for those items! which could use better explanation on the 'How and Where' part of it since the diagram is poor.  That's why the lower rating from me.  Would I buy it again?.  Yes, because now I know how to assemble it! But I would willingly have paid extra if it came assembled.  NOTE:  When you ever see a message on any assembly that says ""DO NOT Tighten The screws completly until they are all fixed in the correct position""... That means one thing, Always!........That the screw holes may NOT be properly aligned.  You will see that message in several places, and you will see what I mean.

    First, I love that the color looks exactly like the image. I love that I can listen to music right through the chair itself. It was super easy to assemble. the pillows are comfortable. I will say the strap for the headrest one broke pretty quickly, but that was an easy sew fix. Speaker quality isn't surround sound or anything special, but its still a neat feature to have. I do spend most of my down time in this chair and it is very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.

    This chair is beautifully made! I got it because I work from home and I needed a comfortable chair to sit in for 8+ hours. This chair definitely delivers in the comfort area!It wasn’t super difficult to put together. The most difficult part for me was attaching the seat to the connector. Also I did have a hard time putting one of the arm rests together. But nothing a little elbow grease couldn’t take care of.Other than that, set up was easy. The chair is super comfortable!The one drawback for me is the foot rest. It’s hard to pull out and even harder to put back in. There is no release mechanism so you do have to use some strength to take it out and put it away. I’m assuming it’s just cus it’s new though, so may get better with time.Also I wish that I had the option to lift and lower the foot rest at different angles because sometimes I don’t want my legs stretched out.Also the material needs to be wiped down frequently. It gets dirty quickly.Aside from those gripes, the lumbar support is great. My back no longer hurts me.The chair moves very easily. A little to easily. I had to put a rug underneath it but that’s because I have wooden floors.I have yet to test out the speakers but I’ll get to it one day.For now, the chair is amazing and is serving its purpose wonderfully.

    Very nice office chair  great speakers sound quality is good bluetooth signal cuts in a d out  once in awhile  but  it's an easy troubleshoot  the receiver just needs to get valcroed under  my desk for a better signal which I'll do once I get into my bedroom of the house with my desk. Other than that it's a beautiful comfy chair and the sound quality is awesome.

    I bought this as a gift for my fiancé for Christmas. He loves to play call of duty on his Xbox, just like every other dude. I wanted to get him a gaming chair that was still aesthetically pleasing. Our den/game room is the first thing you see when you enter our home so it was important to have a neutral color chair. The color is perfect however the quality is not. Both the arms have broken off within the first month of him using it. When you try to reattach them or tighten them so they don’t break off, there’s no resistance to hold it in place. Like the threading in the plastic isn’t there for the screw to grab onto, if that makes sense. He still likes it though and says it’s comfy.

    This chair is amazing, assembly is super easy and lots of spare parts just in case.assembly booklet was pretty easy to understand.everything arrived in perfect condition via FedEx.I have tried many chairs and to me this one get all 5 stars.as for the padding on the bottom and sides is excellent, this is not a soft chair like some in the market, so makes it even better however is up to the user, some prefer soft, super soft or firm. to me this one is perfectly firm.Speakers on the back are ok, wish it had something a bit better but i do have a digital sound system for my games so no biggie.

    Simply, it was very easy to put together, Bluetooth works incredibly, so far it’s not as plush as what the product image shows but actually still pretty comfortable. Naturally since it’s brand new, it’s a little solid because it needs to be broken in but after a few days of some excessive gaming time, I’m sure it’ll adjust very well to my body. Everything is in great quality, material smells nice (weird I know but I love the smell of new things), recline with foot rest is probably a little dangerous because I know I’m gonna fall asleep in this thing. Overall I’m incredibly impressed. I’ll come back to this if anything changes after some time has passed. (Oh note I should add I’m 5 ft 1 and it fits me really well, probably not suitable for tall people)

    What I did like was the Style of the chair. It's not your run of the mill color scheme for gamers. It was very comfortable. What I did not like, was one of the screws for the wheel base would not go in all the way. The major drawback for me, was the seat was bobbling up and down because the platform mechanism the seat sits on did not have an extra crossbar added. So I had to add several strips of heavy duty velcro to keep the seat still. And also, the cats that hide the bolts and the tube that hides the gas lift should have been a harder plastic. These were very flimsy. If these were updated with these problematic features, it would be the perfect chair.

    My friend purchased this chair last year and had recommended it to me. I have a full time remote job that I started a few months ago and my previous chair was not helping me. My back pain and hip pain was getting worse. Too many hours in a seated position is not ideal. I decided to bite the bullet and purchase this chair and it has been life changing. The support of this chair was felt immediately. The pain I felt in my back, neck and hips lessened. Proper support made all the difference! . I highly recommend you invest in yourself. This is worth it. The chair also has a foot rest so I can stretch out and leans back as well. These are just bonuses. I have not utilized the speakers yet. We will be ordering this for my husband next.

    This is a good chair , looks exactly as pictured. The only things are it arrives completely disassembled so get your tools out because the tiny ones take a while to use. And the other thing is it is a little squeaky when leaning back not super crazy but sometimes it is loud and catches you off guard haha. Looks lovely. Comfy.

    This chair is great. It’s comfortable & sturdy. The speakers are a nice feature. The seat is a little stiff but might soften with use. The foot rest is convenient but isn't top quality. Still overall i like the chair & for the price it’s worth it.When I received the package one of the arm rests was broken during transport. I contacted the manufacturer with an email. They asked for some photos & receipt. Once confirmed they immediately sent out a replacement & informed me that the parts are warranted for 1 year. The punctual response & warranty made this a 5 star purchase.

    I’ve had this chair for a couple months and I love it.  It remains comfortable through a full work day when I’m working remotely.  I’m 6’2” and 220 lbs and the chair feels very solid and well-built.  The built-in speakers are surprisingly decent and the rechargeable Bluetooth module has a remarkable battery life, still indicating a 75%+ charge after long gaming sessions.For an adult my size, the leg rest is small and feels like I’d end up damaging it, but my kids love using it.  The recline feature is also nice as you can adjust it to the exact position you want then lock it in-place, versus typical desk chairs that either tilt back all the way or don’t tilt at all when locked.Overall, I would definitely recommend this chair and I feel it would still be an excellent value at a higher price.

    My new home came with a built-in desk and a BIG suede office chair, that left a 5""‐6"" gap between the chair and my back, and arm rests outside of my elbows. The previous owner was an over 6' tall older man and I am a 5'1"" female.On a tight budget, I searched to find an affordable cat-proof ( =non fabric) light-colored chair that looked good, fits me, and supported my low back and arms at the right height.This chair, designed for teen gamers <5'9"" who spend hours in a chair, met all that.It was easy to assemble.Only complaint is that the back pillow needed velcro strips at each end to hold it up in the small of my back; I was suprised it didnt come with them.  Once those were added, it was perfect.The built-in speakers are a nice bonus and beats wearing those annoying pods in my ears.

    My biggest issue was the hardware kit was missing 2 screws. The kit had the count on it and said that much. The manual said the correct number. The good thing was they were a  common screw and locally available. Chair is sturdy and comfortable. Comes with built-in speakers that face away from the occupant and toward anyone else in the room. Might have been 4 without the hardware shortage and 5 if the speakers made sense. There is good enough potential I would buy again, so not too bad.

    So far I love this chair it’s very comfortable and was easy to put together the Bluetooth speakers are pretty decent and material of the chair is nice and it looks just like the one in the picture. Only issue I have with it is the foot rest is really weak and feels like if you put to much pressure on it it will bend or snap you don’t get much support at all from it which is like that with most of these chairs at this price range. Also I read people were having problems putting on the arm rest that it would get stripped while screwing them in and I thought this happened to me but then I noticed the washer was in the way you have to make sure when screwing it together that the washer is placed right since fixing that problem the arm rest have been sturdy.  But other than that it’s a solid chair and I am very happy with it.

    I was squeamish to but a gaming chair off of Amazon, but this one caught my eye and also had some great reviews. Turns out I was correct. I received the chair today and all the parts were neatly packaged and labelled. Assembly of products can sometimes be difficult, but it was not with this chair. It took just under 30 minutes to put the entire chair together. I am 6'2 and 150 lbs. and it fits me very comfortably. My only complaint would be the footrest not really being a ""footrest"" its more of a ""back of the knee rest"" for us tall folk, lol. All in all, this is a great gaming/work from home chair. If you sit at a desk to game or work, I highly recommend this chair!!!!!

    Purchased this in December of 2023.  It was easy to assemble and comfortable to start.  But now, barely 3 months later, the studs in the armrest under the padding have broken leaving the padded part of the armrest to flop off.  There seems to be no way to contact the manufacturer to get a replacement part either in warranty or to purchase.  Very disappointing..

    I am a gamer but I bought this chair specifically for work, as I started a WFH job and needed to be able to reach my desk without straining my elbows like I was with my previous chair. This chair is fantastic, and more comfortable than the $500+ office chairs that my previous employers would buy. It is firm, in a good way, kind of like it's been stuffed fully. There is a slight plastic-y leather-y smell that is pretty strong but I'm sure will pass. Update: it did indeed pass within hours, honestly. I'm not a sensitive smell person so it may be more like a day or two if you are one, but now half a year later it doesn't even smell if I press my face against it and breathe as deep as I can. I have not done anything to try to remove the smell, I don't light candles, etc.I decided to ignore the armrest issues other reviews mentioned, and then when I tried to install them I initially thought I had the same issue. However, you just need to press firmly while rotating the wrench, because the bearings will simply turn otherwise, presumably for the function of being able to lean the chair back. So, you are not stripping the screw and it is not an issue of length; just press very firmly, and you will feel the resistance of screwing it in and will be able to feel it reach full tightness.If you have any issues with the rubber ring for the footrest, what worked for me is holding it very firmly with one hand at the top, and using the wrench to pull the bottom over. It takes some tries, but I just wasn't able to get it on with my bare hands.

    So I work from home and in creating me a work from home space my partner also wanted a work from home space even though he does not work from home.I told him that he could get a chair that he wanted, but at least had to match the aesthetic and the rest of the room and we were going with neutrals.He was really obsessed with having a gaming chair and the options that he showed me were atrocious and were not going to fit my vibe at all.Therefore, I did my own research and came across this chair which is essentially just like the other chairs he was showing me, but it’s a very beautiful, soft, neutral cream, which goes perfectly with the rest of my office space.It was a little challenging to put together, but it is very comfortable.

    It looks just like the picture when assembled.  However, there was a problem with the chair...it has three rips/tears in the leather/vinal material but nothing I can't live without.  The packaging was damaged on one corner but was limited to the packaging itself and nothing inside.  I took pictures of the damaged box just in case but didn't need to make an issue out of it.  Assembly would've been a breeze except that there weren't enough of the right screws.  I got the right screws from the local hardware store.  They send ""extra"" fasteners but not the ones I needed.  Comfort and use are spot on and fulfill the reasons I bought this chair.

    Got it for brother for his birthday and he said it’s a 5/5.Cons:-the material is gonna be easy to stain, but most like this are.-putting the legs on was a struggle because you gotta hit them hard against the floor to make sure they are in properlyPros:-instructions were clear-didn't take that long to put together, about average time-looks like a fancy car kind of seat, exactly like the picture-has Bluetooth speakers built in if you like that sort of thing-can lean back and kick your feet upNot sure if user error but the foot rest is a little janky about sliding in and out, but I might’ve not tightened the screws properly so don’t let that deter you! I got weak hands so it’s probably my fault.Overall, fresh out of the box and freshly built: we are happy with it. Let’s see if it holds up to gamer rage later tho.Highly suggest so far!

    I’m 6 foot eight and 330 pounds and it seems to work well for me I’m not sure how long it will last though it’s a good option for the next year maybe two but if I were you I’d just spend the extra hundred bucks and get one that will last upwards of four years maybe five or six

    The chair is comfortable. The only problem was the left arm was very hard to attach due to the screw receiver on the seat being misaligned. Otherwise easy to assemble & granddaughter loves the chair & built-in speakers.

    Great for everything else and all the options and accessories are great for the price. Only tiff is the bottom is very flat. Not good for hours or streaming but I bought a separate seat cushion to help.

    I had difficulty putting together the base. It takes alot of muscle to put them so lined up with the screws. I didn't know if there was an easier way so emailed the company. They went above and beyond sent out a new base and 2 lwgs. Plus pillows. My left thumb was broken putting this chair together but that is my fault. Looks great and my son loves it. Definitely recommend buying this chair.

    The style color and comfort are as good as it gets! This chair fits my man cave/office perfectly! It's very comfortable and has great style. I'm a 6'2"" and 205 and it holds me easily! The footrest is a great addition and is great for relaxing in style! This chair seems to envelop you in comfort!

    Ordered this to replace an old chair, and I'm glad I did.It is easy to assemble--unless, like me, you infer from the illustration of each part by itself that it must be missing the head and lumbar cushions. It's not; they come in the box already in place, and you need only adjust their position to taste. Two other tips:1.  Put the rubber rings on the ends of the assembly and let them stay for a day before you take them off, slide the rest into position under the chair, and put them back on. That made it much easier for me to get them in place with the rest beneath the chair seat. (Alternatively, you might choose to ignore the order of assembly in the manual and put the foot rest on before you place the seat on the base.)2. Double check the tightness of the plastic tubes before you install the foot rest, or you'll have to take the foot rest off, tighten, and put the foot rest back on.That said, it's comfortable, and I appreciate the head and lumbar cushions greatly. I'll update if/when the hydraulic cylinder gives out.... and sure enough,UPDATE: the hydraulic cylinder is indeed dead. It doesn't even rise and then promptly sink when I sit on it. This is quite disappointing. Looking for a replacement--inclined not to ask SITMOD for one, because they gave me the one that failed in relatively short order.

So I shopped around for weeks before finally biting the bullet and getting this one. I did NOT want to spend over $100 on a gaming chair, but this is the world we live in and now I’m actually really glad I did. Pretty darn good chair if you ask me. I got it for work because I am fully remote. And I play a lot of sims4. It’s comfortable and I like it a lot. Bit stiffer than I anticipated, but easy to put together and solid for the price point. The low back pillow comes in clutch, but the massage feature is loud so I never plug it in. You can tell it’s a bit cheaper because the cushions are very light weight and not exactly cushion-y. It’s about as cushioned as a block of styrofoam.  The fabric quality and color is spot on though and the foot rest is a great touch, so far I use it every day. I’m 5’0” and wanted something I could fit in and sit cross legged or on my knees when I get restless at my desk and this does the trick.One thing I do really wish was different is the reclining feature. It’s either locked in one spot or unlocked and reclines alll the way back. My chair at work had three settings on that so I could stop it from reclining all the way but still rock. With this had that feature. Still love it though and would recommend it if you’re trying to save money!

    I bought this chair in 2023 and it actually only lasted about 6 months before breaking.  I'm only writing this review now because I've exhausted myself looking for options to fix it and have come up with nothing.  So here I am, lets start with a general review.First, the chair is quite nice, it looks and feels good, meshes well with my set up, and the massager/pillow combo it came with are a great bonus addition.  The footrest... Exists, and over all the chair felt sturdy, we'll come back to this, when I first built it.One of the first issues I noted was the seat as it very quickly became uncomfortable.  I was able to address that with a cushion I had purchased for my last chair but I understand most people won't have that.  The second issue was quite a surprise as I didn't know it was an issue until I was looking up at my ceiling.  The frame of the chair is extremely cheap, despite being made of metal, and bent until it broke without my realizing it.  I'm specifically talking about the part where the pneumatic tube, if that's the right word for it, connects to the seat of the chair.  Sometime back in October I was watching a show and stood up only for the seat to rise.  At first I thought the release had slipped so I checked the bar but it wasn't working at all.  Deciding that it wasn't that big of a deal I moved on with my life until the next day when it wouldn't raise at all.  I keep the chair low so I didn't really care at that point and sat down, that was a mistake.  As I lay there looking at the ceiling, cursing my old body, I began to wonder what had just happened.  I lifted the chair and noticed that the seat and back combo were wobbling so I took a look under to find that the metal housing around the pneumatic tube was bent and broken.  From the looks of it, the welding went first and then the metal bent and cracked around it.  I don't remember hearing anything that would make me worry about that so I really don't know when or how it happened.  I'm well within the weight recommended for the chair as well so I highly doubt it was a weight related issue either.  Still, I was overall satisfied with the chair and decided to see if I could just buy a replacement part but I had no luck finding it.With that being said, I cannot in good faith recommend this chair.  I mean, it might be okay for like a ten year old but then I'd also worry about safety considering the cheap construction.  On top of that, this is a fairly pricey chair if its only going to last for six months, give or take, of mild use.  I recommend anyone reading this look elsewhere and I hope you find that perfect seat.

    I'm a big sim racer and wanted something more comfy to replace my dying chair. This thing is comfy guys. The chair feels really well made and the foot rest is sturdy. Just don't make a dumb mistake like me and put the o rings on before you slide the footrest in place. Make sure you put them on AFTER. Will be getting more o rings tomorrow. Great product and worth the money.

    Going to keep this simple..Pros:Sturdy seatNice material & colorLumbar & neck pillows are comfy and supportiveCons:Feels a bit small unless you're sitting uprightButt portion of the seat is made of thin material and feels like sitting on a wooden chair after a bitLeg attachment is very weak and will break eventuallyWheels are pretty stiff compared to most other chairsI'm about 50/50 on this chair. It looks nice and feels nice but I wouldnt recommend this for an ""all day"" chair.

    I purchased this chair about 4 months ago, and it is extremely nice and comfortable. I would recommend because not everyone will have my experience, but what I will say is the parts seem old and/or cheap. I cant seem to find a support page to get a hold of these guys otherwise as their website just brings me here. I have to replace the piston as it started sagging.. Then apparently the plastic around the cylinder just broke into 5 pieces at the top of the piston where the chrome metal starts to be exposed because of that now the bolts to the left arm are messed up from the offset seating and long gaming sessions so those have to be replaced and my last complaint is the lumbar pillows like flat as cardboard now. even with constant fluffing. Otherwise this chairs been great. Just glad my and half month pregnant girlfriend didnt sit in it when the piston popped on us..

    It's decent, i wouldn't put anyone or anything that weighs 200lbs in it. I tried sitting in it and using the foot rest to see what it was like, and the foot rest felt kind of flimsy.But it was perfect for my little sister, who only weighs around 100-120lbs.

    I received this chair today. Overall, the chair is comfortable. It took me less than 30 minutes to put together. The directions were easy to follow and I was able to assemble it myself rather quickly. I will update the review after using it for a few months. The fabric has a soft woven feel and the cushioning feels firm. All the holes lined up nicely to screw everything together. I wanted a gaming style chair to have more head support when sitting at my desk all day and this chair does provide the extra support I was looking for.

    Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)I recently took the plunge and invested in the SITMOD Gaming Chair for Adults with Footrest in the sleek all-black version, and I have to say, it has exceeded all my expectations.Let's start with the shipping experience. Despite a minor hiccup with UPS causing a brief delay in my shipment, the chair arrived in pristine condition. I was slightly concerned during those extra two and a half days, but once it arrived, the packaging was intact, and the chair itself was in excellent shape.As for assembly, I encountered a small glitch – there were no instructions included. However, I'm pleased to report that the absence of guidance didn't hinder the assembly process. In approximately 20 minutes, I successfully built the chair from scratch without any major challenges. To those who claim this chair is too complicated to assemble, I'd suggest brushing up on your DIY skills – it's a straightforward process, even without instructions.The chair comes with all the necessary bolts and an Allen wrench, making the assembly hassle-free. The stitching on the chair is impeccable, giving it a premium look and feel. One delightful surprise was the spacious seat – it's wider than expected, promising a comfortable gaming experience even during marathon sessions.The inclusion of a footrest adds an extra layer of luxury, providing optimal support for extended gaming or work periods. The ergonomic design is evident, ensuring that every aspect of the chair contributes to a comfortable and enjoyable seating experience.In conclusion, the SITMOD Gaming Chair has won me over with its comfort, ease of assembly, and stylish design. It's a testament to the quality of the product that even without instructions, assembling the chair was a breeze. If you're in the market for a gaming chair that delivers on both aesthetics and functionality, the SITMOD Gaming Chair is a solid choice. Say goodbye to discomfort and hello to uninterrupted gaming bliss!

    As a slightly short woman I have been looking for an office chair that fits, gives support for my tailbone & hips, as well as giving me lumbar support that I can adjust to my needs, and this chair has delivered on all of those things! Do be aware that the depth of the lumbar pillow cuts into the actual length/depth of the chair's seat. I wasn't sure I would ever use the foot rest but have found that when I do several hours of gaming it has come in very handy to elevate my feet. The only two drawbacks that I have experienced thus far is that the head-rest pillow doesn't come down far enough due to my short stature; my neck hits the chair about where the sides flare out, and the tilt handle is too far down and back to use it without leaning far over and back - if I had extra long arms there would be no problem, and that is why I only gave it a 4-star rating overall.  The seat is quite firm, which I like but others might find it too hard. With the instructions there were several issues: (#1) because I put this together by myself I did not put the wheels on until the whole chair was together, (#2) test the bolt placement for the underside mount of the chair BEFORE anything else [had to send 1st chair back due to them being to far apart], (#3) instructions are not at all clear as to how to bolt the foot rest onto the frame so do not put rubber gaskets on the frame ends UNTIL you have tried sliding frame into holders beneath the chair seat and seeing if the foot rest will stay put and will then flip up. In my review pictures I have 3 showing how the foot rest should be. I like that the lumbar pillow can be moved up-n-down without it falling out, also if you are not going to use the vibrator you can pull it and its USB cord out through the pillow's zipper. I like the material as well, it is not rough on your arms-n-elbows and it is cooler than the fake leather of my old chair. Although this is a tad more expensive than a regular office chair I fell that it is well worth it - just wish it were made here in the USA and not in China where that gov't gets a slice of every business' sales. I looked for one made here but not able to find any even though a few of the really expensive ones are USA companies.

    the seat has hardly any cushion, it is better to sit on a metal folding chair. If you are a bigger person the sides of the back will squeeze and hurt you. The lumbar support does nothing if you plan to recline the chair at all.The seller is very willing to work with you to get a suitable product weather it be an upgrade or a refund for your purchase. They did everything to solve the situation. I did not like the chair but my petite niece enjoys the chair very much. Please know a bigger person will not be comfortable in the chair but if you are on the smaller side the chair can be a nice asset for a very good price.

    The fabric seems nice.  As a bigger guy, it feels stable enough to support me but overall it's a pretty uncomfortable fit since the bucket seat style kind of hugs the hips similar to a race car seat. Also, the stitching is really bad in terms of the logo. So bad that I thought my chair was uneven and spent an additional 30 minutes trying to figure out why. Turns out, the company name goes up and to the right at a slight 10⁰ angle if not a little stronger. Just enough to seem like a factory mess up and also enough to bother anyone with OCD.It came with a pillow for lumber support and a head pillow (likely to hide that offset logo stitching). I plan on using the pillow to hide that embarassing uneven logo from my viewers eye sight while I stream but otherwise, it's not too terrible of a chair. Definitely a ""you get a little less than what you pay for"" situation though. Big quality drop when compared to the GT Racing chair it's replacing.

    Lets start with the basics of this chair i have own this chair for almost 2 weeks now.. its a decent height with fair amount of room on the cushion on the bottom when im gaming or typing up something on the computer i have no discomfort but im not exactly comfy either. its like a fair medium for long periods of gaming i game in sessions of about 2-6 hours at a time depending on the day so i can assure you its not a hunk of junk the back massager is a good bonus but i haven't really used it much i plugged it in and i didn't feel much of a difference (I have a back condition) the top extra is nice i will say, i use it often when i recline in it now when i recline in it i dont exactly feel secured but it hasn't broke down on me yet it feels like you're falling in a sense but i am also a larger and tall man so it could just be me now the footrest personally i think its not that great now. if you dont recline and pull it out it feels very flimsy and could break it like fragile so im a little upset with that feeling but when you recline back and use it it does feel sturdy and if you're like me and want to put your feet up without laying on your back from time to time this chair is not for you i would invest the extra 100$ and get something more well known for quality if thats the case the arms i will say not very good the left arm i have 0 problems with but the right arm constantly gets loose on me and i have to keep tightening it about every 3 days but overall i dont have to many complaints with this chair its great if you're on a budget or just want something straight forward this chair is a good fit for you or even a back up chair but if you got the money i would invest in the more expensive chairs for quality but this chair does have its looks and strengths but the downsides are a concern for people like me

    Super easy to assemble. The bolts that hold in the leg rest part come loose consistently and were unfortunately recently lost in my move and im unsure what size bolts, but I suppose I'll have to replace them. When the leg rest is out and chair is leaned back the leg rest bends down considerably and it feels like If I use the full top part of the chair it will topple over. The arm rests keep bending well out of place and I quite literally have to snatch them back to their normal position. I like the thought. I like the assembly, but def some errors that need to be upgraded for it to be much better for its intended use.

    This chair is great if you're a child or child sized but if not the arm rest is not your friend. It's much too low for an adult. I'm only 5'10 and after a hour or two my shoulders are killing me. My partner is 5'4 and the arm rest is too low for even him.Giving it a 3 star because I'll admit the seat padding is comfortable enough for hours of gaming and because it's a affordable game chair. But the arm rest is really a buzz kill. Perhaps they should try making it higher or at least adjustable.

    This chair is comfortable, but hours of sitting on it can leave you feeling uncomfortable. The leg rest doesn’t nearly go out as far as my legs do, so it’s just an awkward position to be in. The arms get loose extremely quickly too, so they just wobble around.

    Spent 2 months researching for a good gaming chair on a budget, since I started a little gaming set up. Have to say, I had my doubts because you can’t obviously buy a high quality chair on a budget BUT I’ve been using it for a couple of months now and I have to say I’m surprised of how nice it is. It gets a little uncomfortable on your behind after a couple of hours, if I’m being honest, but overall it gets the job done. It’s simple, pretty and the name of the brand looks good comparing it to others. It’s also pretty wide and you can adjust it nicely for your comfort. The material looks and feels durable and chair overall is very sturdy.

    This buy doesn't just speak luxury in my office, it is also super comfortable, except for the neck support, that I still haven't found the perfect position that works for me. Love it very much.

    I really like the way the chair felt, however it’s already very wobbly and can’t seem to just down and have the chair be steady. I would like to contact someone for help if there’s any way I could fix

    When I was looking for a replacement for my racer type gaming chair, I was looking for comfortability and a foot rest, as I tend to game between 2-4 hours (depending on the game I'm on).  The SITMOD chair, while the fabric is really nice, isn't super comfortable due to the lack of cushion. Obviously, when you're sitting in a spot, it's going to form a dent, but because of the lack of cushion, you end up feeling the hard plastic bottom that supports overall.I am in the hunt for a new chair, though I may stick to finding that in-store moreso than shopping for it online.It would be a good chair short term. But if you're planning for long term, you either want to buy a chair cushion pillow or continue looking.

    Bolt holes weren’t threaded properly left a lot of loose gaps and caused a lot of stripped screws because of the poor Allen wrench they supplied. Would’ve went with a different chair personally if I ordered a new one. Especially for a chair that’s almost $200

    This chair took about 45 minutes to assemble. The leg rest seems pretty flimsy. I will probably never use it because I feel like it would start droop down. Material of the chair is nice. Over all I'm happy w/ what I paid and the chairs' quality.

    My husband had an awful time putting the right arm rest together as the screw hole was not threaded all the way through and at an angle. He was able to fix it because he is has extra parts, but it caused alot of unnecessary stress on his part. Other than that it is quite nice very comfortable and glad assembly is behind us. I'm very glad my husband is so awesome or I would have had to return the whole thing because I wouldn't have thought about it. 4 out of 5 would have been 5 out of 5 but assembly wasnt hell. I am 5'10"" and my ankles hang off the foot rest but his fit great.

    I've had this chair for about 6 months now. Using it for a work chair.  The support is gone.  It's like sitting on the floor in terms of hardness, at the end of the day my butt hurts so bad. It also is at a point where it is hard to not slide off the front of the chair because it leans forward.  I'm waiting for my next bonus to be able to buy a different chair.

    I have been sitting in a horrible office chair to game for some time and this is a huge upgrade. Arrived in a big box (my cat is super happy) and was so easy to assemble. Pretty sure it took maybe 15 minutes. I use it all the time and love it. I don't use the leg rests as much as I was expecting but it is still a nice added feature. It also comes with a vibration option that requires you to plug the chair in. I honestly had no idea it came with that option when I purchased it. TBH its not that great. But its a nice feature to have.My only con about this is the chair is fairly stiff when you first use it. It does loosen up over time and becomes somewhat more comfortable and I have no major issues with it. But if you like more cushion in your seat I would still recommend this chair and just suggest purchase some padding to rest on top of it.

    not as good as i thought it was going to be. for a chair this big, it's not that comfortable. it's decent - better than your average cheap $25 office chair from walmart, but its quite stiff and hard. i can also tell it was cheaply assembled, i can see marker traces left behind from where cuts were made for screws, and some sharp staple ends sticking out of the bottom of the chair. not the best quality but decent. its probably only really worth $90, and you could find a better one for the same price or more.

    Bought this chair to replace the home office chair.  For reference, I'm 5'10"" and 195 lbs.  I've owned the chair for approximately 6 months, though by nature of my work, only used it for half of that time.The positives:  It is a good looking chair.  The lumbar support, after a bit of a break in, is quite comfortable - same with the headrest pillow.  The seat cushion is barely padded, but I prefer my chairs to be firm and it's not terrible for sitting (I sit in it for 12 hours a day).  The reclining is a great option and sturdy for my height and weight.Cons:  The gas lift is possibly the cheapest piece of manufacturing I've ever seen.  For the past several months, it has steadily gotten worse and worse, to the point that if you shift even the barest positions in the seat, it loses pressure and sinks you to the floor.  The chrome cylinder is constantly covered in gunk, presumably oil from inside the lift assembly itself.  The manfuacturers ""contact us"" page is useless (Including the typos on the page) - no response to the three or four requests I've sent.  While I find myself rather handy than most, I see no way to remove this cylinder after installation without potentially damaging the rest of the chair, so even if it could be replaced with another, it'd be improbable to return it to it's original state.Final thoughts:  If you're looking for a budget gaming chair for periodic use and don't mind a firm seat, this might satisfy your needs.  Otherwise, spend your money elsewhere.

    I’ve had this chair about a week and it feels/seems pretty sturdy I think it will last a while. The fabric and cushioning are very comfortable, it stays cool sitting in it for a long period. Feels stable too even with it full reclined. Pretty easy to put together, and it’s really nice with or without the pillows.

    I honestly love this chair. I wanted a pink gaming chair for the back support, appearance, and size. I've been working from home since last year and needed a decent computer chair. I really love the design of this one since it isn't the typical ""e-girl"" streamer or the chair with the cat ears in pink. I just wanted something nice that was in pink.I saw a lot of complaints that the chair is firm, but I appreciate that. Every ""executive chair"" I've gotten end up getting too soft and uncomfortable. The support is great if you're going to be sitting in it 8+ hours a day working or gaming.I love that the chair is fabric. I need a lumbar support for computer chairs and the fabric keeps it from sliding. The ability to recline and footrest set this chair miles ahead of any other gaming chairs I looked into.It was very easy to put together and took me less than 30min. The instructions are clear and the package came with all of the parts needed. We will be getting a second chair in a different color for my husbands gaming station. Five stars!

    Long story short this chair is great but simply put, it wasn’t an upgrade from my current chair. My current chair is softer and fits me better especially on the seat.The seat is very long. Imagine sitting all the way back in your sofa. See how your knees touch and kind of lift your feet up? That’s this chair seat.The back support isn’t ergonomical at all. Flat and unwelcoming. The pillows honestly made it worse.It reclines very well and the footrest is DOPE. Unfortunately when I actually got it built and put into my setup, I was like, I’m never going to use that :/It’s a great chair if you don’t already have a great chair. 3.5/5

    I'm going to start off by saying it is a $150ish chair. With that being said I didn't expect the world out of it.Comfort is a 6/10 the cushion is kinda stiff. and the arms are just cloth covered with no padding. Also the levers are a little hard to reach i find myself leaning way over the chair to reach them.Quality is a 5/10 out of the box there where a lot of loose threads, both of the pillows for the back and neck have a sunk in flat spot. And the chair overall just has a kind of cheap feel,and crunching noises.Ease of assemble is a 9/10 it is pretty straight forward and not a lot of parts.I don't really find my self a ""big"" person I am 5'8 and 190lbs. With that being said if I where a couple inches taller, or a bit heavier I would personally go a different route. If you need a budget chair and don't game for hours on end I would say buy! If you have the budget for a $500 secret lab chair or other brand then save the $150 and just put it towards that.

    This chair is amazing! Exactly what I hoped it would be and looks great with my setup. I’m 5’7” and 150lbs and it’s very roomy and comfortable which is exactly what I wanted! I’m using it as a gaming chair and it’s awesome to have somewhere to put my feet. If I put the footrest out but pushed all the way in I can even sit cross legged on this chair. The recline works perfectly and it was super easy to build. The whole chair feels incredibly high quality. Based on other reviews I was a little worried about it fitting under my desk but it does with no problem. On the lowest setting there’s around 1in clearance between the arms and the bottom of my desk which is more than enough given the arms are high and I like to sit higher up at my desk. My feet touch the floor but if you’re shorter they probably wouldn’t. They do offer a free shorter tube thing if you need it so I wouldn’t let that stop you from ordering!

    From the moment I clicked ""Purchase"" on the office chair through the provided link, I knew I was in for a treat, but I didn't realize just how much of a game changer this chair would be for my daily routine.Comfort is paramount in any office chair, and this one does not disappoint. The padding is plush and supportive, cradling the body perfectly throughout the workday. The adjustable lumbar support is a standout feature, providing the much-needed back support that's so important for someone like me who spends hours at a desk.But let's talk about the feature that I absolutely adore – the pull-out footrest. It's an absolute revelation! Whether taking a quick break to recharge or settling in for a more extended period of concentration, being able to kick back and elevate my feet is a luxury I didn't know I needed. It tucks away neatly when not in use, maintaining the chair's sleek appearance. The materials feel durable, and the mechanisms, like the height adjustment and tilt lock, operate smoothly and intuitively.To those considering an office chair, look no further. Whether you're typing away at reports, managing online meetings, or simply enjoying a moment of quiet contemplation, this chair, with its superb lower back support and pull-out footrest, will support you (quite literally) every step of the way.

    I love the ergonomic design of the chair and the aesthetic looks - color and style. The chair fits comfortably in my workspace. It arrived quickly and included cleaning pads for the white leather. A large headrest and extended leg and footrest make the chair extremely comfortable for short and extended sitting. Assembly was easy. Product parts are sturdy and of a good quality. There is also a product registration and one year warranty included with purchase. I’m thinking about upgrading other office furniture to match the chair.

    I am 210 lbs and 6 ft tall. I am sitting at my desk 12 - 13 hours a day and have worn several other (cheaper) chairs within a year or so, which have become very uncomfortable and impossible to sit in for long times. I was looking for a more durable and longer lasting solution so I opted for a higher weight rating chair. I was way out of line with that. This chair is huge. At the highest setting my feet barely reach the ground. The arm rest is adjustable in and out (very nice feature) but even at the tightest setting I barely can place my elbows on the arm rests, they are way too far apart for me. The rocking back and fort is awesome. Sitting is comfortable and it has a huge and tall back side. I would suggest if you are less than 300 lbs and, say, shorter than 6'3"" this chair will be too large for you to call it comfortable. Otherwise I love it. The chair is of good quality

    UPDATE 5:The seller responded and AGAIN refused to honor their advertised free gas cylinder replacement, even though the original they provided failed within 3 months.Their excuse was that we were past the return window. The problem with that excuse is that we contacted them well within that window with a replacement request, and they repeatedly pretended not to understand the request, then to reject it. So they're stalling customers until they can say you aren't eligible for anything anymore.Also, if you read reviews, you'll notice a ""warranty department"" is mentioned, and that's who supposedly sends out the replacement parts they advertised. This apparently doesn't exist. Strongly suspect there might be some fake reviews in here given the way the company uses false advertisements and a complete lack of support. Will be reporting them to Amazon today. You should note, they seem to have removed the image that offered the free wheel replacements (though I believe I still have a screenshot for that report I'll file). But they do still mention free gas cylinder replacements in the original is too high (which is what I originally requested).I've now had to spend more money on replacement wheels because the seller lied about offering free replacements (the rubber ones safe for hardwood floors). And now I'll have to buy another cylinder for it. 100% not letting this go. I'm so tired of companies selling furniture items here with false advertising, knowing it's too difficult for most customers to return those items.UPDATE 4:Exactly 3 months from the day we ordered this chair, and after refusing to honor their advertised offer for a lower replacement cylinder, the original gas cylinder for this chair failed.No one using it uses it roughly. No one using it even comes close to the advertised weight limit. It was just being used in a stable position and suddenly failed. We reset it, and it failed again within minutes, making the chair unusable for us.I'm going to contact the seller one more time and insist on a replacement cylinder given they outright advertise they provide one, but if they refuse again, I'll be taking it up with Amazon, because this combination of quality issues and poor support is not acceptable.UPDATE 3:I definitely cannot recommend this chair. After weeks of use (with the wrong wheels and gas cylinder size because the company refused to honor their offer to send replacements), this chair causes a lot of pain. Lower back pain in particular is really bad. I suspect it's due to the combination of the very hard seat (disappointing given I looked for a spring-based seat intentionally -- if they're there, they're too small to be of any use as you still feel like you're sitting on a hard board) and the lack of lumbar support. Despite their description, there is basically NO lumbar support with this chair. It's incredibly painful even after minor use. I may even have to go back to the old chair this was replacing as the entire point was to reduce pain and increase comfort, of which this chair does neither. It's poorly made. It feels very unbalanced if you lean at all (especially with the lack of proper tension to prevent you falling backwards all the way). Way too many cracking and creaking sounds for a chair this new being used well below its advertised weight limit. Not supported at all by the seller (other than offering minor refunds to keep the junk and figure out how to dispose of it yourself at a loss). Just overall feels unsafe, uncomfortable, and I can't trust either the chair or the seller.UPDATE 2:After several back-and-forth messages with the seller here on Amazon, they've repeatedly ignored requests for the free replacement wheels (needed if you use it on hardwood floors) and the free replacement gas cylinder (if the original is too high) that are advertised on this page in the product images. After ignoring the request repeatedly, along with any tips on getting the tension to actually provide... tension... they flat out refused to honor their advertised offer for those replacement parts.All they did was offer a very small refund if we're willing to keep the chair... without the wheels needed for our floors... without the appropriately-sized canister... and without any reasonable tension function to lean back safely (forget ""rocking"" as noted in the description because this chair can't do that). It would cost us more to buy our own wheels and canister than what they offered, and that still doesn't address the false advertising of this being a rocking office chair or the unsafe lack of tension for the recline function.I would absolutely never do business with this company again, and we'll be contacting Amazon to see what can be done about them refusing to honor what they advertised. Extremely disappointed after a very long search for a replacement chair.UPDATE:This page, in the images, says the company will provide free replacement rubber casters / wheels if needed (which you need for hard floors), and a free lower replacement gas cylinder if the chair is too high (which it is for my wife).After asking them to send these multiple times via Amazon's messaging system, they've so far refused to do so (will update if they sort this out soon). They've also responded to questions about fixing the lack of tension and the misrepresentation about this being a ""rocking"" chair (it's definitely not; just reclining), and all we ever seem to get is a copy/paste response offering a small partial refund if we agree to keep the chair. We keep trying to tell them we're hoping to keep the chair, but we needed info on getting the tension to increase and we need the replacement parts they offered to make it work. But they've mostly ignored specific questions and just keep saying the same things. Until the last message where they said they couldn't send replacements for the ""missing parts,"" even though we never said anything was missing. We're just requesting the parts they offer to send right in their Amazon description. Not happy with support at all so far.--ORIGINAL REVIEWI have mixed feelings on this chair. First, it feels like a sturdy build. And if you're on the larger side, the cushion offers plenty of support -- firm, but mostly comfortable.The exception to the seat's comfort is that the front edge is very firm, and it can cut into the back of your thighs, negatively impacting circulation. This was the problem with my old chair and why I was replacing it. Normally I prefer a higher chair, but this is causing issues even at its lowest setting. The seller does mention in the images they'll send a lower cylinder if necessary, so if I keep the chair and receive that, I'll update on how that affects the pain at the front of the seat.The seller also offers to send replacement wheels if you need the rollerblade-style kind for hard floors. The plastic ones are extremely loud and totally inappropriate for hard floors and their protective mats, so it's nice they provide this option. But if you know you'll need them, I'd request them early. Otherwise you won't be able to fully assemble things until they arrive, or you'll have to risk damage to your floors using the defaults until the replacements can be swapped in.While I like the sturdy sense I get from the chair, there are two big problems for me. I've contacted the seller hoping I'm just not figuring out the settings properly, but I'll update if appropriate later.1. The description advertises this as a ""rocking"" office chair. With office chairs, that means something very specific -- the back and seat move in unison in a true rocking action. This looks like the seat can angle back a bit based on the video, but it doesn't seem to do that when ""rocking."" All it does is lean the top back. That's not a rocking office chair, which was an absolute requirement in me choosing this as a replacement for my old chair. Again, I'm hoping I just missed a control or something and that this will work as-advertised. Oddly though, when the foot rest is out, the seat itself does seem to recline back, so it clearly *can.* It just won't rock otherwise? And if you have heavier legs, or longer ones like I do, the leg rest isn't really usable because your center of gravity will get thrown off (and that's the one thing that doesn't seem sturdy in general). So, for a chair advertised for bigger users, are we simply not ""allowed"" to use the rocking function because it's tied to the leg rest??2. I'm also having issues with the tension knob. All the way in one direction and the back of the chair practically falls backwards the moment you touch it. All the way in the other direction and there's barely any more tension that that. It leads to a very insecure feeling unless you lock the ""rocking"" function, which again was a major deciding factor in choosing this chair. I'm hoping I'm missing something here too because I've never seen an office chair with this lack of tension.Other than that, the back is comfortable, and I like that the arms are adjustable (width during installation, and height while in-use).Aside from the rocking and tension, two things would make this chair near-perfect though:1. Adjustable lumbar support. Fixed lumbar support is all but useless in an executive chair because if you're sitting properly you're not going to be leaning back all the time. Proper lumbar support doesn't require you to recline back. It should help you stay upright and maintain your posture.2. I agree with another reviewer who was disappointed in the lack of head rest. For all the padding on the back of this chair (which is soft, yet dense enough it feels like it will hold up for quite a while), there's no real head rest. The head area is relatively flat and sits too far back, so your head won't even touch it unless you're lying back in more of a reclined position.The only other comment I'll make for now is that any reclining is pretty loud. There's a surprising amount of squeaking and creaking for a new chair. If I keep it, I might see if something needs to be greased. But if not, just know that could be an issue if that sort of noise bothers you.Oh, and like another reviewer, my box also arrived quite damaged. The entire bottom was split open. At first we were afraid we received a used chair after ordering a new one, but the internal pieces seemed OK and everything was there. But if multiple people are receiving damaged, open boxes, I'd make sure you have somewhere sheltered for this to be delivered. Had this been left by our garage in the rain (as many larger packages are here), the chair would have been ruined before we even opened it.

    The chair was easy to assemble but some mechanical skills are helpful- how to use an allen key and how to tighten a couple of bolts. If you have a 12mm wrench at home and perhaps a 5mm hex socket it will be much faster. If not, the included tools work fine.I've used this for a couple of months now; I am working from home 50% with some 8-10 hours in the chair daily.It is very comfortable for me and the material feels nice. Good quality. I am 6ft2 tall and on the highest setting it is just right to keep my knees at 90 degrees. The armrests are adjustable in height, and by adjusting the bolts the width can also be adjusted. The angle of the seat can not be adjusted. Just the height.I bought an additional headrest/pillow on Amazon (see second picture) which fits perfectly and helps to keep my spine straight. Without the pillow my head is either 'free floating' (no rest) or leaned back. This might be ok for most people but I find the addition of the pillow made this chair even better.Support and customer service is very good. After a couple of months (outside the return window) I noticed that the chair seemed to be always tilted to one side but it changed as I turned it. I found that the base of the chair (the star-shaped metal part at the bottom where the rollers attach) was likely to blame because it was slightly uneven.I contacted the seller and they very quickly, within a week, sent me a replacement part free of charge no questions asked. Now it's perfect!I would recommend this chair.

    It’s a great chair honestly, but I bought it because I’m a bigger size girl and work from home so I’m in my chair a lot. Unfortunately it doesn’t have many settings for where you want the back to be set. Actually, there’s only two…one for straight and the other is if you want to rock back and forth. The only thing is, I need my chair to be straight for my posture and anytime I lean back hard it doesn’t stay put and it’ll back up further which can be annoying for me. It’s a super comfy chair and I sit on it for 8 hours a day, sometimes more. I just wish the back stayed in place. Good thing is that it was easy to assemble.

    As a WFH professional spending long hours at my desk, I needed a chair that offered both comfort and durability. This chair delivers on the comfort front, with its plush cushioning and ergonomic design. However, I found it to be a bit oversized for my frame, which unfortunately led to some discomfort and back pain after extended use.Thankfully, the customer service team went above and beyond to assist me. Their prompt and attentive support helped me find solutions to adjust the chair to better suit my needs. While it required some extra effort on my part, the end result was worth it.Overall, while the chair may not have been a perfect fit initially, the exceptional customer service made all the difference. If you're willing to put in a little extra work to customize it to your liking, it's definitely worth considering for your home office setup.

    I recently purchased theExcebet office chair with mesh black material, and I couldn't be happier with my decision! If you are needing a new office chair, I promise this is the one you want! The seat is incredibly comfortable, providing ample support throughout LONG workdays without sacrificing breathability thanks to the mesh material.Moreover, I was pleasantly surprised by the exceptional customer service I received. I'm short (5'4) so even on the shortest setting the chair was a bit too high for me. I reached out to Excebet and they sent me a replacement cylinder right away!The representatives were not only helpful but also genuinely kind, ensuring that I'm 100% happy with my new office chair!Overall, I highly recommend the Excebet office chair for its comfort, durability, and outstanding customer service. It's a win-win for anyone looking to upgrade their workspace with comfort, style and functionality.

    I mean, its a 300 dollar chair. I think we all have the same expectation; better be a damn nice chair for 300 dollars.I work from home and have no kids. I also am a renter, and spend some of my free time in the same chair for TV shows, movies, and general entertainment.Its easy to put together, everything fits in a way that feels sturdy, none of the screws or bolts or anything felt chincy or stripped out the threads during assembly. Everything works well and feels sturdy that's the key.You never know what you're going to get when you order online, but ive been using this chair for maybe 12-16 hours a day for the past 7 or 8 days though and this seems like a great purchase.

    I bought this chair on an Hope and a Prayer.  You never know what to expect these  days.  I wanted something nicer than what I had...  and heck yeah, I got it.  Big heavy box with lots of protective wrapping that ultimately revealed some very thick meatal parts and very fine fabric.  As mentioned before, very easy to assemble.  And then done.  You have simply the best chair you ever owened.  My Adult children sat on it and immediately declared the it was the ""best chair they ever sat on"".  So I bought one for each of them.  My son is 6 feet tall, I am 5'9"", and the dawwter is 5'7"".  The chair is the perfect fit for everyone.  Everyone is happy.

    Not going to lie, was a tad shocked at the height of the chair but after we built it, which was pretty simple, I sat in it and immediately fell in love with this chair. I work from home and was looking for a chair that would provide good back support and a solid butt cushion and this thing delivers! The back is very soft and gave my lower back the support it needs while being stiff enough to create a great sitting experience while I work. I love that the reclining option can be controlled and it even has a foot rest! I literally told my coworker I could take a nap in this thing lol! To top it off the customer service I reasoned is impeccable! Even my husband was impressed as well as my son after sitting in it. I highly recommend this chair and the company!

    I took about an hour to assemble by myself. Compressing the back cushion against the seat cushion to install screws that hold back to seat was hardest part of project. Otherwise reasonably easy assembly. Providing a few extra screws and washers, just in case, was a nice touch.I've only sat in it a few minutes so far. Comfort is okay, not great. Too many smallish cushions in lumbar area are very mildly uncomfortable. Easily cured with thin pillow over lumbar area to even out all the bumps. And, as others have commented, headrest is set too far back to be at all useful. I suppose I could wrap some sort of additional cushion on top of existing headrest to bring it further forward. But these sort of ergonomic adjustments shouldn't be necessary these days. The issues are just too obvious to anyone who has sat in the chair for even a few seconds.Biggest complaint is that I ordered ""Light Brown"". I received ""Beige"". By beige, I mean band-aid flesh tone; far from my favorite color. I think I have seen similar complaint from at least one other reviewer. I don't know who has responsibility for picking products from the warehouse. But someone tends to be a little careless. Given what I've heard about Amazon warehouse working conditions, I'm certainly not going to pursue the point. And I'm not concerned enough personally to go through the hassle of disassembling and returning for an exchange.This chair is too ugly to use for formal office meetings. I guess it will become a knock-around utility chair.  Remains to be seen how well this chair holds up after months or years of use. BTW, fresh out of the box, this upholstery smells like plastic, some version of vinyl I think. It's not overwhelming but definitely there. Hopefully, smell will go away eventually.

I’ve had this chair almost a month now, and it’s sturdier and more comfortable than any other computer chair I’ve tried. I work from home and play games on my personal computer, so I spend a lot of time sitting at my desk. Other chairs would not feel supportive enough, or they would hurt my back or butt. This is the first chair I haven’t had an issue with and it was worth the price!While I don’t use it too often as I like to sit up straight while at work, the leg rest and recline of the chair are also very comfortable to use.Customer support even reached out to me to make sure I didn’t have any issues and offered me a free lumbar pillow. The pillow is seen in my second picture and is a great addition to the already very comfortable chair.Assembly was also pretty pain free, I normally have to have my boyfriend put furniture together for me but this I was able to do mostly myself. There were a few parts two people were required for me to set parts straight and lift the chair as it is a little bit heavy.

    Needed to replace my expensive office chair that lasted 4 years but due to Working From Home basically wore it out (getting fatter didn't help...) I needed something that's comfortable for work duty and also for my hobby, spending many long hours making and painting military models, so, after extensive research I decided on this beauty, it had the looks and the reviews, and after years and years of black leather chairs, I was taken with the Light Brown color, in real life its was better than I thought it would be!Really easy to assemble (less than an hour!)Having gotten used to the benefits of Roller Wheels, I reached out to the seller to take advantage of their free Roller Wheels replacement, and the seller has been brilliant! wheels shipped in a very fast time, very impressed with their customer service!

    This chair was worth every penny!! It is so comfortable and its also extremely easy to assemble, it took like 10 minutes.

I don't really have any complaints but I really wish it came with an additional pillow to support by neck or my lower back :)

    I’ve been researching chairs and prices for the last 30 days then I decided to go on Amazon and see if I can find the same chair for a cheaper price. Amazingly, I found most of the chairs I was looking for for half of the price of the major stores I found this chair online And buying a chair is kind of like buying a pair of shoes you don’t know how comfortable it’s gonna be or the quality until you see it but I give it a 10 out of 10 it’s a little firmer chair super easy to put together and for $299. Glad I made the investment , I would highly highly recommend this chair to someone who likes a comfortable chair

True white; whiter than original description--which is what I was looking for. This is comfortable, goes back and locks into place, goes up and down and swivels. The seller offered a set of rubber wheels which are now on the chair (great customer service)! I was looking for a sturdy chair that would not wobble and this is it. It was easy to put together by myself, although it's advised to have another person help, I was able to complete this alone. There is a built-in lumbar support. I'm tall--5'9"" and also use a footrest under the desk. One of my better investments.

    Just received it from Amazon this morning. Replacing my 18 mo. old AKRacing chair due to lift cylinder failure. The Excebet Desk Office Chair, Big and Tall arrived on time. The box was a bit beat up, but the packing prevented any damage. Fairly easy assembly which took approx. 40 mins. Much easier with a ratchet and allen socket. Included wrench would have taken forever. It should be noted I am older, have some movement issues and really took my time.  Upon trying it was “comfortable” but not great. Definitely not worth the original $499 price. Still debating about the $299 current discounted price. The pseudo leather is nice and cushioning is comfortable. The biggest issue is it has fixed lumbar support and side cushions that support the shoulders but does not have a head cushion. So, in essence, your lower back is pushed forward, your shoulders lean back and your head leans so far back against the head rest it is like sitting in a dentist chair. BUT I would rather have that than the overly large head pillows that push your head forward even when leaning back.The jury is still out. Not a clear winner or loser. I may just have to get used to it after the non supportive AKRacing chair which definitely was an over priced uncomfortable chair!

    Great chair for full support.  I can sit comfortably using the arm rests and lumbar support for when I’m working.  Then when I need a recovery break I just pull out and foot rest and lean back.  The chair holds my neck great and softly if I lean back and it can deal with me being tall.  Love the chair so far and would recommend.

    The shipment arrived heavily damage, had I been home when arrived, I would not have accepted it.  Once I open the box I notice one of the arms on the base was pressed into the chair back. The chair back was protected by a plastic bag and had no damage, just needed to massage a little. Two of the arms on the base had scratches.  The arms are heavily wrapped  in cardboard and bubble wrap and this wrapping was not damaged, so the scratching must have been done before packing..... thus the large discount 499 to 299. This is my opinion. After assembling,  the scratches aren't noticeable.  Now the positive: For me the chair was easy to assemble, all of the hardware was in place and extra hardware is given and all parts where there, the chair fucntions very well as it should and it is very very comfortable. I purchased it for my wife's home office and she loves it, guess thats all the matters. Nice chair. Hope this helps others

    For reference I've had a Ficmax and Dowinx gaming chair previous to this one. I wanted a chair in the same competitive market as both but one that matched the aesthetic of my current gaming set up.The biggest plus to me is that this chair was the easiest to assemble out of all three chairs. No awful pilot holes, everything was clearly labeled, only took 5 steps, and most of the screws already had the washers placed onto them before being neatly packaged.Immediately comfortable out of the box, and in pristine condition considering white is the hardest to maintain.All in all this chair is my recommendation compared to both Ficmax and Dowinx.

    After I research on Amazon , this is the gaming chair I picked!I have to say it’s way better what I thought! First it has easy instructions to install, all parts packed well.Second, it’s comfortable that you can adjusted the back to any angle you like.Finally, the texture of material feel good and you can tell it’s not cheap~Overall I am very satisfied with this product, I think it’s time to get your own gaming chair!!!

    Looking for a comfortable gaming chair?The OneGame Video Gaming chair provides long duration comfort for those extended gaming sessions. The chair is super easy to build and everything needed is provided. (Including the 6MM allen wrench). In terms of comfort, I’ve used this chair for long coding sessions, and a few long video games and found it to be very comfortable. I guess the most important observation is that I didn’t notice the chair even after an hour of sitting in it. If you are going to be seated for a long time, then consider the OneGame chair.RecommendedBuild: My total installation time was approximately 30 minutes from start to finish. The instructions were extremely clear except for one tiny area. The back bar can be installed in two ways, and the installation instructions are not clear on the correct method. The manual has a QR code that is labeled installation video, but it doesn’t go to a video either. No matter, I skipped that step initially and after building the seat area, it became evident that the back bar needed to be installed with the side with three screws facing down. I also found an installation video on Amazon that shows the correct orientation. (at 1:06 into the video). Overall, the chair build was simple, easy, and fast.Ergonomics: The mesh back and soft seat make this chair comfortable for long periods of time. I had a little issue with getting the headrest, lumbar support, and armrests into position. I think the chair is designed for humans under 6 feet tall. I just removed the headrest to be comfortable since it was too low on my back. The lumbar support falls down every time I get up, but it’s trivial to put it back in place. The armrests will go up and down, and slide front to back, but do not rotate in place.Feel: The chair rolls smoothly on nice high quality wheels. Additionally, the materials seem well made and have a “new car” scent. The scent went away within 12 hours, but I enjoyed it while it lasted.

    This is the best gaming chair I have ever owned so far, and I've gone though many over my 16 years of playing World of Warcraft! It was very quick and easy to assemble, it took my husband less than 15 minutes to put it together. The instructions were clear and the hardware was well organized.The chair is surprisingly comfortable to sit in for hours. It reminds me of a higher-end driver's seat. The seat cushion is wide and comfortable, not too stiff or too squishy, I would say pretty much perfect. The cushion is vented,so it doesn't retain heat.The backrest is comfortable as well. I wasn't sure if I would like the mesh backing, but it provides support and does keep me cool with the open ventilation. The headrest pillow has an elastic band to keep it in place and is easily adjustable. This also comes with a small lumbar pillow that helps provide great lumbar support. The only down side to this pillow is that it doesn't have an elastic band to keep it in place, so you will have to consistently adjust it to where you want it.The tilt/recline feature is top notch. Great range of angles and the full recline is stable and comfortable. Can absolutely take a nap in this chair if you want to! The seat height adjustment is easy to use and the hydraulic is strong. The arms rests are 3D, so they adjust forward, backward, and up & down. I like the ability to be able to adjust them to make my arms more comfortable while gaming or being on the computer.Also, the caster wheels on this gaming chair are smooth as silk. They glide so effortlessly on my tile floor and the chair is so easy to move, even while sitting down on it. My last gaming chair was old and the wheels were so bad, I could barely roll it around!The only negative I have to say about this chair isn't even about it's materials or construction. It has a couple of black scuff markings on it (pictured) that came on it as we were unpacking it. Not sure where they came from, but it was unfortunate to have marks on the seat cushion and on top of the chair upon arrival. I tried cleaning them off also, but they seem to be permanent black marks. It doesn't take away from the functionality of this chair at all, but it's something to be aware of if you decide to order a white one, it may or may not come with black scuff marks.Overall, I am thrilled with this gaming chair and I absolutely love it. I wholeheartedly give it 5 stars and very much recommend buying it!

    Of all the computer chairs that I have owned, this is definitely one of the most comfortable. My favorite feature of this chair is how the chair reclines, most reclining gaming chairs will only go back and set at 3 or 4 different points and then be locked in to that specific point, where as this chairs reclining can be stopped and set at any point. The seat cushion is nice and is right at that goldilocks zone where it is just fits in between of being soft and firm, and all in the right spots.The assembly is super easy for this chair, the construction is literally 2 pages with big pictures and labels for all the parts and hardware. My wife and I were watching a Tv Show when I was assembling it, and I had it completed before the episode had finished, so in total it takes maybe somewhere between 25-30 minutes start to finish.There is one issue I have with this chair, and that is the backrest, or the back of the chair. It looks and feels like some cheap plastic, mine is NOT broken or busted, but the molding in a few big different spots is very warped, like most plastic molds are made with big metal molds that are pressed together and then molten plastic is poured into it and when they separate the molds it has a perfect shape, the back rest for this however with this kind of warping seems like it was made from one side of a mold, that they just panned and rolled the molten plastic into place with.The reason i bring this up is because the chair pops loudly every time i set in it and lean back. It is a loud enough pop that sounds like something is broken, but I have checked this chair multiple times over, and made sure all the bolts are securely in place, nor is there any busted plastic. So this brings up the question of Longevity, and I cannot be certain that this chair is durable enough to last even a year without falling apart. Now that being said, I have only had this chair for less than a week, its just a sign that this chair is giving that that normally doesn't surface well into a chairs life, and this one is Brand new. I have a sneaking suspicion that the warping in the back plastic I was speaking of is the culprit for the loud popping the chair exhibits when you lean in it.All that being said, the rollers are smooth and the arm rest are great, the Popping in the back rest doesn't make it any less comfortable of a chair and it is indeed super comfortable especially being able to lock the backrest in anywhere.

    This is a great looking chair and is super comfortable. It was a great addition to my gaming setup. I love how unique the white color is. My wife calls it my storm trooper chair. The seat has this perforated leather look that reminds me of a high-end sports car. The neck and back rest are really nice to have. The mesh back and perforated seat breathe really well, so I don't get hot in this chair.It's easy to adjust the height of the chair and the height of the arm rests. Make sure to lock the tilt mechanism. The first time I sat in the chair I nearly fell over backwards.The chair was pretty easy to assemble in about 10-15 minutes. The instructions were good, although the pictures and font were really small. The base required more assembly than other chairs I've owned. It included extra screws, which I greatly appreciate. The toughest part of assembly was attaching the back bottom plastic plate. It was a little difficult to line up and get snapped into place.The only thing I would change about the chair is the lumbar support. It falls down the second I get up. If it could attach to the chair I think this would be an improvement.

    Got this primarily as my office chair. The chair itself has quite a bit of weight to it so that seemed good before even opening the box.Once the delivery box was opened it was disappointing to see that not everything was packed great. The gas lift has already broken through it's packing.  It looked like the base plate wasn't packed right, and the box looked like it was opened (maybe this was while it was at an Amazon distribution center?), but when the chair costs as much as it does, you expect everything to be packed right.  Luckily nothing looked damaged and everything was in the box.Assembly doesn't take very long. The instructions are clear and the screws you need to use are also labeled, so that makes it so much easier. It took me maybe 15 mins to assembly this chair.  Ah allen wrench is included so you need no tools to assemble it.The chair looks good assembled.  The backing is mesh, and feels decent. There's a plastic backing that's the back of the chair and basically it's hollow in-between that and the mesh.  The cushion has good support and feels good fit extended periods of sitting.  I'm not sure how it's going to hold up over time, if it'll flatten, but for now it's good.  The material feels decent too (again hoping the wear and tear is good on this).The armrests, initially look hard, but they have some give so that's a plus. They're not ""soft"" but they're made of what seems like injection molded plastic.  They're comfortable and they have enough height adjustments that my elbows can rest on them properly.The raising and lowering of the chair is easy, and the gas lift seems to work well.  I don't like that the metal part of the lift is exposed (in most chairs I've seen a plastic flexible cover over it). I can see this collecting dust, especially since it seems to have a little bit of grease/oil on it. The recline of the back is good too.  I keep it fairly straight, but there are enough adjustments to get the position you want. The rollers on this are very good, and it moves so easy.Overall this is a good chair, and I'm only knocking off a star due to the poor packing.

    Fairly decent office chair. I love all the different options with the reclining and raising and lowering of the chair. Those work great. It's not as padded or comfortable as some of the office chairs i've had but it works for what I need it to. The extra pillows and lumbar pillow are a little too stiff and are loud when rubbing against the main material of the chair. Assembly was fine besides the instructions not showing a very good description of which direction the back bar needs to go. So I guess on that one. Other a decent office chair.

    Definitely a pretty chair with a lot to like about and clearly built not only to play games, which it excels as a gaming chair, but also to relax, which is where I found a little bit of an issue that I'll explain below.I like the overall quality and ergonomics, but I believe that many if not most users will feel that it is a bit on the hard side, which means that it is not super comfortable for relaxing. On the bright side, it will last even being beat by the hard core gamers out there. Here's the odd thing. It feels very comfortable  when playing games. It only feels hard when you try to relax on it. But I would still recommend it since I never found one that would be perfectly comfortable for both functions.

    This chair is great if you have back problems. Comes with great support pillows. I really appreciated the instructions and felt they were incredibly user friendly. Loved that the hardware all came labeled and not in a bag jumbled up together. I do wish the lumbar pillow had a way to be attached and not just sitting in the chair. Also, I wish the arm rests were farther up. They are too far back, so someone as short as me.

    The chair look absolutely amazing and is an excellent fit into most interiors because of the color. It is also well-ventilated and comfortable. Recline works well, adjustable armrests are a plus. I didn't quite like the pillows - it is quite cumbersome to use those so I just took them off completely. My biggest complaint is that half of the pieces came with tears and worn spots on the right out of the box. Moreover, these tears cannot be taken off and are pretty deep. Besides that, this is a great chair and well worth it's price.

    It’s nice, I like the reclining feature. It’s comfortable and came with two pillows. Only thing is that the outsides made of plastic so I don’t know how long that’ll last. But it looks nice and it works as it should, wasn’t to super hard to put together, but also not super easy either… like medium level. Comes with the tools you need to put it together. All you need comes in the box with it.

    Ive had a couple of racing chairs and one ergonomic chair and while the ergonomic chair usually beats all my chairs, this gaming chair gave it a run for the money! Unlike most chairs, this one features a straight flat back that I personally find much more comfortable than the standard racing chair, and the cushion is much more thicker than other chairs. For someone with back problems, this chair helps me keep my back more straight than any other chair and that helps me with pain management! Its easy to assemble and really POPS out in my room since its all white! Its commonly mentioned on my stream where I get this chair!

    I really like this chair. It is very sturdy and was extremely easy to assemble. My 4 year old son helped me and we had a great time getting it all put together. Once it was assembled, we both agree that it is very comfortable! The leather is very soft and has the perfect amount of grip. The mesh back is comfortable and allows good airflow to keep you from getting too hot. I think it definitely needs the lumbar cushion, but the head/neck pillow is a bit of an afterthought. It seems to me that the designers and engineers finished a great chair and the marketing team said, “wait! Other gaming chairs have these neck pillow things! People won’t buy it without one of those! Also, we need a second location for our logo!” So the engineers and designers threw one at the marketing team and said, “fine! Use this! It doesn’t need it and we are not changing the design of the chair since it is great the way it is, but if you insist, here is a pillow for your logo!” So, it includes a neck pillow that really only works if the chair is leaning way back and doesn’t really fit well or stay on well. I never lean my chair way back, so I never user my neck pillow. Other than that, the chair is awesome! I got the white one and if you wear new jeans, it might turn it blue. So far, mine is still nice and white. It also has been easy to clean.

    I got this chair for use in my kids' computer room.  The chair was very easy to assemble, as a disabled person that's important for me since I am limited in my mobility.It's very comfortable, and the adjustment controls work very nicely.  In addition to the standard height adjustment, the back rest can easily be positioned and locks in place.  The castors roll very smoothly.  The arm rests have a height adjustment which works smoothly and locks solidly, but the arm rests are otherwise fixed in place.If I had any complaint at all, it would be that the lumbar pillow doesn't have any kind of retaining strap or similar to hold it in place, so it's always falling over.  It just rests on the back of the chair.  I don't personally think that warrants removal of a star from an otherwise great chair, but I did want to mention it.

    This thing is so cool looking and comfortable, I feel like I am the captain of my own space ship.  Mine is white, and I am thinking about customizing it with some color.  The back of it has a shell that you can make your own or just leave it as is.  I feel like I am in a Star Wars movie riding in the Millennium Falcon.  It is very easy to assemble, even I did it.  The instructions are clear and concise, so much that even a cave man could do it.  It took me about a half of an hour to put it together.  And get this, the tools supplied are well made as well, no twisting and not stripping of the heads.  Now the comfort, I have noticed that I am no longer sweating on my back like I used to do with my full leather chair.  This has a mesh back, and vented seat to keep you cool and comfortable.  Now not only does it have a lumbar pillow, it has a smaller one for either your head or I have mind just at the base of my head and it is very comfortable.  It's adjustable, even the armrest are adjustable.  Great value for the money.

    Assembly was fairly simple and quick. All hardware and tools were included with the chair. The chair looks nice and is comfortable. 2 levers, 1 to adjust height and another to lock the reclining position. The back mesh is firm and feels supportive. The top part comes with a pillow that is adjustable or removable while the lumbar support pillow is just a freestanding pillow. Lumbar support could be better, but the pillow does offer some support. I changed out the wheels, but no issues with the standard casters. The quality is nice and the adjustable arm rest heights are convenient. Good office chair or gaming chair.

You can lock the back in place so you can sit straight up or release and lean.

The mesh on the back is nice, and the seat is a weird pleather, but its not bad. The chair looks nice, and its a clean white, not a cream or anything. The place where the back attaches to the seat has a cover to hide the components, and I appreciate that attention to detail.

    I was not expecting a gaming chair to be my ""garage chair"" but it is.  Tall back.  Deep and wide seat.  Adjustable arms.  Comfy and supportive.  Price seems to be on par for other similar chairs.  Rolls well too

    This is a great chair for the price you're paying. It's comfortable, looks nice, and seems sturdy. Had a 300lb+ person sit in it and they had no issues whatsoever. Chair held up and they were very comfortable. The casters work well, it swivels like a champ, and the lumbar support is adjustable so you can move it around to be exactly where you want it, instead of hoping for the best. Overall, very pleased with the chair.

    This is a nice mid-level quality gaming chair.  It wasn't too hard to put together as we've now assembled several chairs in our lifetime so you sort of get the hang of how they generally go over time.  I've seen much better wheels than these and can already tell that they are going to get gunked up in the carpet in no time at all.  We'll be looking into our replacement options.  A younger teen is using this chair and they report that the seat is comfortable to sit in.  The 2 moveable cushions are nice as this makes the chair completely adjustable to the person sitting in it.  Teen loves that it reclines way back.  The mesh backing is nice to keep the body from overheating.  All in all, it's a good chair for the price.

    breathable, durable spins and swivels, and is easy to assemble, what more can you want from a good chair.IU use it at my pc for easy access to the things around me but can see how great it would be for gaming as it is super comfy for extended periods of time.A great value, a nice addition for anyone that uses these types of chairs.

    This is my first brand new game chair and I gotta say, I quite like it. Some of the parts packaging seemed rather thrown together and gave me a chuckle but all in all, it got here undamaged. There were moments when assembling I was skeptical but everything came together just fine, some parts (bolts) needed a little more elbow grease to get in but now I'm positive they won't be coming out any time soon. This chair is pretty darn comfy, bottom cushion, the back it like a hammock over a frame, optional pillow supports (lower back and head/neck), even the arm rests are firm and lightly squishy. The base is made out of solid metal and the back out of sturdy plastic. Overall, solid and comfy, I like this chair. Oh, and the hardware was very neatly organized and directions easy to follow.

    This computer chair, is comfortable and sturdy. It allows you to recline, and lock in any angle recline that you want. It also allows you to go up and down simply so that you get the right height. It does give you neck and lumbar support cushions that you can adjust.The only problem I had, was, there was one picture in the instructions that wasn’t clear, that connected the back to the seat. Took me about five minutes to figure it out, then it was great! I would definitely recommend.

    This gaming chair didn’t take long to put together for me being a single person. It was pretty much straightforward which I like. The gaming chair itself is not the most comfortable for me personally as I like a little bit more cushion but it works. The only thing I would have to say that I’m not totally loving is that the chair itself is able to lean back and lean back it does almost to the point where you can fall if you tip it way back enough. The chair doesn’t have a feature where you can stop it from leaning back a certain degree. It does glide across my hardwood floor pretty well, the little pillow it comes with is a bit hard and does nothing in my opinion. My teen seems to like it though.

    Review for the ""OneGame Video Gaming Chair""I'll start with the things that seem negative.1. The lumbar support is awful, and that included pillow feels very unnatural against my back.2. The head pillow is hard to position with the wideness of the chair, seems like a poor addon.3. There is no spring support when adjusting the angle of reclining.Here are some positives.1. The seat cushion is comfy. (At first I and others did not like it, but it felt better after a few days.)2. It reclines far back which is nice for lounging and watching long form content, or relaxing.3. Assembly was easy.4. It seems very sturdy.I think this is a good chair in some respects, but for the negatives I pointed out. I would not be able to use this as my main chair.

    Recently, I purchased a Victrix BFG Pro. I was skeptical, especially with it lacking vibration. I was borderline not considering it, mostly just because of that. After a few articles showing that Victrix will be adding Hall Effect Sticks in Q1 2024. Price being 40 (USD) for a pair. That's incredible pricing. So awesome upgrade. This matters because I also have a SCUF Instinct Pro Wireless (worst), Razer Wolverine Ultimate (my backup), and my new baby Victrix BFF Pro. Stock, the SCUF comes with no Hard Case. Just the basic swaps for D pad and Sticks. I had to purchase the Hard Case EXTRA, for like 40 or 50, I believe. It came with an additional cord, some additional stick top. And other little stuff. Starting left to right again, The hard case is a nice color grey and the inside is textured and looks great. It's the thinnest of the cases and for one that was paid extra in addition to the most expensive controller of the bunch at 200$ (prices are rough memory estimates). The case for the Victrix is ever so slightly thicker and only noticable if you have them side by side. Both would protect a drop in almost all cases. Inside, the Victrix has a top pocket for the EXTREMELY NICE Purple braided cord (type C to Standard USC). Also has stacked Styrofoam layers of tools and replacement parts, which includes the additional fighting pad that can be swapped with the right joy and button combo pad on the right side of the controller. The next up is the VERY sturdy and thick case. Inside is the pocket up top for the cord and the bottom houses the replacement D pades and sticks (which are held on by high power magnets and is the best setup of the three). With the information given, you'd be understandable in thinking that the SCUF was the worst of the bunch. In price? Sadly, yes. In usability? Hell no. The SCUF is my favorite to use. The reverse button placement is perfect *FOR ME*. Durability wise? Horrible, don't buy, trash, borderline a scam. Not only is SCUF already known for that, it turns out this first of the better QC lot was in fact, crap. Within the first 3 months I had to have it in for a faulty button and faulty bumper. Not a quick process since it's inconvenient to have no controller. Thankfully I'm a nerd lol. Got it back and all was golden. Then after a few months, the same button and bumper started not registering clicks either. Not every time. Just 1/10 I'd say. But you would be shocked how much is messed you up lol. Now, sitting at 14 months with it? Not great at all. 2 buttons. 1 bumper. 1 trigger. All faulty. Never dropped. No liquid anything. Kept literally in a hard case whenever it wasn't in use. I play a few hours a week total so this is minimal use. Terrible product. They will fix it. But I gotta pay for shipping and the full repair. So I'm stuck. Worst 400$ I've ever spent on controller and extras. The Victrix is so awesome. I have medium to medium/large hands lol. Not huge. They are on the CUSP of being too small. Which makes them perfect for me, but it might not be for my bigger brethren out there. I have not noticed the lack of vibration a SINGLE TIME. I even tried to pay attention for it and still didn't notice it. So I guess that's neat lolol. It feels light yet sturdy. It's what you would want for long sessions. Light weight and upgradable/repairable. Victrix doesn't sell replacements of anything yet, that I've noticed. But everything points to Q1 for the start of all that. I've been XBOX my whole life so my brain is struggling with the PlayStation symbols. Sell the XB setup for extra. Just a different single paddle. I'd be so happy. This is my go to by a mile. The Razer Wolverine Ultimate is a wonderful controller. The button placement on the back is TERRIBLE. That's all personal preference so I won't knock it for it. Build is solid. Can't speak for other products of theirs. It's very heavy in comparison. By a chunky margin. But it works great. Feels great. Way cheaper in price but not quality at all. They did a great job with that line. So I'd saySCUF - 6Vicxtrix - 9Razer - 7.5/8

    So I'll start with the best and main feature: The modular face. I can't stress how awesome this thing is for players like me that struggle to find button/dpag/analog setups that work for the way we like to play. For example, I play claw style, so having the 6-button option is a must. Need to go back to play a game where 4-button makes more sense? No problem, just swap the pieces, which is super easy. And those units can be flipped, so for instance, I like the dpad in the top-left most position (by default, that's where the analog stick is, like what you see in the picture), so I simply flipped it. When I'm playing, I also hate having the analog stick in the way, again, no problem, just pops right off (and you get extras).This modular feature is important because if you play enough, eventually buttons and dpads go out. For a long time, I was using the Hori FC4 (original design), which was a great controller and fairly inexpensive, but the one drawback was that it broke down pretty fast. Pro players that use the dualshock will tell you they replace them every several months, at most. Although I haven't seen it yet, I have to imagine that Victrix will sell the face pieces separately, which will eventually not only give players like me the ability to easily and cheaply replace wornout components, but it opens the door for more designs for those pieces in the future.Otherwise, it has a bunch of other premium features. You can go wired, which for many of us is really important, and the wire is nice and sturdy. Same with the case for the controller and all the various pieces to it. It has a built-in feature to program (or turn off) the back-grip buttons, and multiple profile options, so even though there is an app that allows for more input customization (which is also a rad feature), you don't need that to do some basic input customization. It also has built-in trigger stops, which is amazing, and a tournament mode to disable your system buttons and the touchpad. The pad has a nice, heavy weight to it, too.Before I got this thing, it was clear it was designed for tournament play in mind. The question I had was whether the dpad(s) would be any good. I use the old, basic, Nintendo cross-style and so far it's working really well. All of the other features, too, are highly-desirable when in a tournament setting, and they function great. But, they went beyond that to ensure that if you want to use it like a normal, casual controller, you clearly can.So I'll say that at this point it seems the wait was worth it, but I'll end with a caveat: This isn't a casual controller. The price tag should probably tell you that, but I can easily see certain people being disappointed with this thinking it's going to be good for casual use. You really have to be thinking about a competitive setting to see the value you're getting with this pad's features. This controller is comparable in quality to something like the Razer Wolverine v2 but has way better features for competitive play and practice, yet the Wolverine is $70 more. I've used the Victrix for casual gaming already and I can tell you it works great there, too, but unless you're taking advantage of all the features that a non-competitive game *isn't* going to use, then this is probably too expensive.Ultimately, a fantastic controller.EDIT: The Victrix Control Hub now works with the BFG, so that eliminates one criticism I had. Now the only thing left for them to address is replacement parts for the modular pieces. This could be make or break though: I've asked them about this and for now even requesting parts directly is not an option. The clock is ticking on that because when everyone starts to have breakdowns, no one is paying for a brand new BFG when a piece that should be really replaceable can't be replaced. That's going to wreck this thing's reputation.

    this controller is probably the best alternative to the Elite Series 2 so far, at least until MS releases Elite Series 3 with a share button. It has a good grip and it fits nicely on my hand, and is overall a solid controller. the hot-swappable buttons are a great addition and would merit at least an extra .5 star on this review if you are on the market for a new pad to play fighting games on.the problem with that is that the buttons are a bit TOO sensitive: I still have to find a resting position that don't activate one of the triggers. The Sticks also lack a bit of mechanical resistance, so any flick of the thumb sends you spinning. for Fighters and more action heavy games (such as high speed hack n slashes), this means you will probably be battling the analog stick as much as the opponent, at least for a while. The d-pad is the way to go here, but all three options need a bit of time to get used to. My personal choice is the 8-directional one, you have to learn to touch it lightly.Then there is the software, which is a bit clunky, but get the job done. On the first day there was a bug that wouldn't let you re-assing the triggers buttons, but that is fixed now. so at least you can be sure Victrix is still improving it.This one will be my daily driver until MS releases the Elite 3.

    i love the idea of this controller but the execution is worth about $40, not $180. quick pros and cons:+modular controller-except for the right side, which arbitrarily can't be swapped Wii U/Steam Deck style and instead gets an awkwardly positioned six-button pad-needs a tool to actually change things around, unlike every other similar controller-blatantly inadequate alternate sticks - only one convex stick, only one long stick. why??+four well-placed back buttons-they're ludicrously over-sensitive compared to better, sturdier implementations (KK3, Steam Deck), making them worse than useless for most people-no alternate back button options like the KK3, Xbox Elite, etc so i hope you have the exact same finger length as i do, otherwise you're boned+decent build quality, most of it probably won't fall apart any time soon and it feels good in the hand-except for the sticks, which aren't hall effect, so enjoy 100% inevitable stick drift on your $180 controller.-still not as nice feeling as Microsoft or Sony's high end controllers (though both of those also have issues)-no motion control at this price is absurd-no rumble at this price is inexcusable-weirdly sensitive bumpers and triggers, though i personally got used to it-poorly implemented trigger pull depth customization, though to be fair, i've never seen this done decently. honestly, if non-analog triggers is something you really want for a game, just get a switch controller and a converter.-xbox version is the same price as ps version despite having no touchpad (actually 5 bucks more as of this writing lmao)with all these downsides the only use case i can see for this is fighting game tournaments, and even then there's far better options for far less money. it's true that you can buy replacement sticks and d-pads for this, but you could buy a new saturn controller and EIGHT replacements for the same price as this controller - that's with zero replacement parts - and have an infinitely superior fighting pad with far more longevity. if this was $140 cheaper it'd be a decent buy for some people, but at this price it's absolutely terrible

    Only owned a few weeks. Nice to have a controller without the annoying inline thumb sticks for the PS5. A little overpriced, but then maybe not due to battery life alone vs the PS5 controllers. The PS5 default controller has 8-10 hours of use with vibration off. The DualSense Edge for $200 only has 6 hrs of battery life (what the ____). The Victrix controller so far is averaging 20hrs. Another plus is that the charging cable is 9.75 ft long, if one wants to keep it plugged in, which I do not. To me, the best controller is the Elite/Core controller. The victrix controller is as close as it gets on the PS5. For battery life alone I would suggest this controller over the PS5 controllers. The only nitpicky complaint so far I have about this controller is the triggers, they curl out at the bottom more so than any controller I’ve ever used. If a person uses one set of fingers for the bumpers/triggers it is a moot point. If a person uses two sets of fingers for the bumpers/triggers, that will be an adjustment for some. This controller has no vibrating motors built in, which is fine with me. On all my controllers I cut off the vibration features due to extreme drain on the batteries, combined with I find them annoying to add. Betting Sony is not allowing 3rd party controllers to have vibrating motors. No 3rd party controller does so far for the PS5. Pretty sure that is not a coincidence which is fine with me, but may not be for some.

    Controller is S-tier in almost every category of things.I'm going to go over the incredibly short list of cons before I go over the list of pros;- won't turn on your PS5 (you can use your TV remote if you have a TV from this decade).- currently doesn't have an app or software, so you have to change button configurations manuallyNOW FOR THE LONG LIST OF PROS:The ergonomics and overall design/engineering is honestly far superior to any other PS5 or even Xbox controller on the market.  It is a HIGH QUALITY, WELL-DESIGNED controller meant for LONG SESSIONS or tournament play.- Configuring back buttons and profiles is super easy, so is everything else, I'll add a link on how to use all the features at the end of this review.- The back buttons feel better than any other controller I've ever held, to include the new Razer, the Scufs, the Elite Series 2 (which are my #2 favorite paddles now).- The D-Pads are wonderful, not loud and clicky like razers but have a nice muted feedback to them, I prefer the hybrid d-pad or the Victrix d-pad.- Super easy to swap out thumb sticks and modules and rotate them.  Thumbsticks feel great, the longer one is impressive for FPS/TPS.- Triggers are sensitive, require very little actuation force.  Super reactive, really a 10/10, trigger stops seem more like they have 3 stopping points than 5, but still super easy to use.  Triggers are also textured for grip, but very soft.- The grips on the controller are perfect.- 2 Year warranty as opposed to other companies.- Customer support is better than any of the other companies who I've ordered controllers from.- l1/r1 buttons have a different feel than any other button on the controller, very similar to mouseclicks.- Controller is LIGHT.  This will not hurt your hands after a 10 hour play session.Every single button/stick/interface on this controller is designed with comfort and efficiency in mind.It is SIGNIFICANTLY better than any other PS5 Pro Controller Alternative.  Its ergonomics alone make it better than the Razer Pro (F-tier design, and FFF tier customer support).  The Dualsense Edge only has two paddles, and a three hour battery life, which also make it an unworthy comparison.  While SCUF's quality is nice, they have a 6-month warranty period, and are SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive.  SCUF also modifies the DS5 as opposed to building a god-tier controller from the ground up.I've used this controller on both my PS5 and PC and must say that I've yet to experience a better controller.And this review is BEFORE they've even released the software for it.  I can't wait to see what that's going to be like!Link to their instructions;  https://support.pdp.com/hc/en-us/articles/11045034301325-Victrix-Pro-BFG-Wireless-Controller-for-PS5-PS4-and-PC-User-Guide

    Pros: The controller is very comfortable, it has great d-pad options & the diamond d-pad itself is the best I ever used; the buttons feel nice on press too. It's great for PC and the Steam app. The case it comes with is very good; I love the fact that you can switch around controller styles & you can make the analog sticks have octagon gates. It was built with many different types of people in mind. I like the fact that this controller was designed & intended for the type of people who don't want to switch between 2 or more different types of controllers to play a variety of games. This controller is very close to perfection in my opinion and Victrix could make the next installment even better if done with even more types of people in mind.Cons: Too expensive, no bluetooth, it's very annoying when you have to use the screwdriver everytime you wanna change the style, and you can't remove the 4 back buttons when not in use. Out the box you'll see that the triggers are super sensitive and activates at times you dont want them to because you slightly pressed them. The software isnt helpful when it comes to the triggers; if you wanna play sfv or any 6-button fighting game, you can't make the R1 & R2 into L1 & L2. This is because as of the time of this review, you cant change what the trigger buttons do in the software app; this could be fixed with a simple update. THE MECHANISMS FOR THE TRIGGER LEVELSp ARE THE WORST DESIGN EVER!! It's annoying to change the trigger levels and a pain to set it to the middle level. Everytime I play a game my finger would accidentally touch/slide across the trigger switcher and it cause the trigger to reset to the default trigger position. In the software app I have the triggers set to activate at the very bottom of a press; so when the sensitive trigger mechanism gets touched & resets the triggers to the top position, the game wouldn't recognize my fingers pressing the triggers down unless I switched it back to the bottom position. When this happens while I play online in a fighting game, I have to stop playing and fix the triggers back to the position where the game will recognize it again; and while I'm fixing all this my opponent gets a bunch of free hits on my character. When this happens every time you begin to realize that this controller is unplayable unless you get rid of the trigger lock mechanism. I very much think this controller should have trigger locks but just not this specific one that this controller has built into it. This controller is too expensive for its flaws.Opinion:This is a cool controller, the case along with the other accessories you get inside the box are all useful and it gives you alot to test with. The diamond d-pad is my favorite part about this controller, it just feels great when playing online in fighting games. I definitely want Victrix to make more fightpads in the future, but the software app customization should be more like 8bitdo and the trigger lock switches should be like the xbox elite controller. It's too expensive for the amount of flaws and frustration it causes. I thought this controller would be the fightpad to make me feel like I could stop searching for a perfect controller to use for fighting games, but that's not the case here. I did see a few youtuber reviews who also agree that this controller isn't worth the high price and that there are too many flaws. There are also tons of youtubers praising this controller and I just wanted to share my experience. I honestly think Victrix can improve on these flaws and make an even better controller in the future; I do like the options it offers but not the execution. For the current price you can probably find more affordable & less stressful options. In my attached review photo; the red controller next to the Victrix pro bfg is an Aliexpress controller that I got in June 2022 for $25-30. It has a great d-pad, the button presses are responsive and works with whatever fighting game you like; I highly recommend it, just search fightpad on Aliexpress and you should see it. At most this is not a bad controller it's just too expensive, if this controller was $100 or less and had the same issues, I probably wouldn't have written so much in this review tbh. If you don't wanna spend almost $200 for a fightpad, then I'm sure you can find cheaper alternatives.

    To get the pros out of the way, it's compact, feels so great in the hands, has decent weight, and buttons are very response. D-Pad isn't clicky, but it still feels solid and the LR bumpers almost feel like mouse clicks. The controller overall is VERY robust.Onto the cons.Con 1: The BIGGEST defect of my unit was when I try to place the left module in the PS layout, I literally cannot move left or down, but I can move up and right. When I put it back in the Xbox layout, no issues whatsoever. This is a PROBLEM. Yes, I prefer the Xbox layout in some games, but other games the PS layout just works. The selling point of this controller is that it can do both layouts, and my unit can only do Xbox. It's unacceptable. Whether it was wired or wireless, nothing fixed this at all, not even updating the controller and the USB hub (the hub requires its own separate update). I'm convinced the module itself is defective.Con 2: This morning, the left trigger stopped working. I had to completely tamper with it by making it fully extend and setting it to trigger stop a few times before I got it working again. This is a bad sign that it's going to get worse.Con 3: Somehow in some way, while I was playing an FPS game, my controller froze and my camera spun endlessly. Unplugging the USB hub and plugging it back in didn't fix it. I had to reboot the entire computer.Con 4: The Controller App for PC IS NOT AVAILABLE! Why? The back buttons are all set to buttons that I have no clue of. Only after about 20 minutes of guessing, I manage to set my ideal actions to the buttons (not set the buttons to my actions). Without the app, I cannot even run tests on what's going on with the left module of the controller. I can only attribute it to a defect. However, as long as the stick calibration and troubleshooting features of the app are not available, I will never know why the left module won't work in the PS layout.Con 5 (nitpick): I use a KontrolFreek foam ring around the right stick for the purpose of having more control over my aim. However, since the long joystick is metal, the foam ring tends to slip upward and makes no contact with the base. While we're on this topic, KontrolFreek caps do not fit, so don't bother.Conclusion: Keep in mind that these are pre-order controllers, and launch models tend to be more of a prototype for future revisions. With that said, had this controller been working as Victrix designed it to work, it would be the best controller BAR NONE! However, now is not its time. More work needs to be done to fix these issues and the software still isn't available, anyway. Overlook this controller. The bad reviews on this option are within reason.Hope this helps.Verdict: RETURNED!!!!11

    When my son expressed his desire for a new controller for his PS5, I knew it was the perfect opportunity to make his Christmas extra special. He had been eyeing a controller that promised not only enhanced gameplay but also the ability to customize every aspect to his liking. So, I made it my mission to find the perfect controller that would take his gaming experience to new heights.On Christmas morning, as he unwrapped the gift, his eyes lit up with excitement. The glow on his face was priceless as he held the new controller in his hands, eager to put it to the test. Without wasting a moment, he dashed upstairs to his gaming setup, ready to dive into a world of endless possibilities.After spending some time with the controller, I couldn’t help but inquire about his experience. His response was nothing short of enthusiastic. He described how the controller’s full customizability allowed him to adjust the joystick height and customize the appearance of the d-pad to suit his preferences. The addition of four programmable buttons on the back opened up a whole new realm of possibilities, giving him the freedom to assign functions according to his gameplay style.Admittedly, there was a slight learning curve when it came to using the additional paddles, but he quickly adapted and found them to be incredibly useful once mastered. Despite this initial adjustment period, he couldn’t praise the controller enough for its performance and versatility.As days turned into weeks and weeks into months, the new controller became a staple in his gaming arsenal. Its seamless compatibility with not only the PS5 but also Xbox and PC made it a go-to choice for any gaming platform. Whether he was embarking on epic adventures solo or teaming up with friends for multiplayer battles, the controller never failed to deliver a top-notch gaming experience.In conclusion, the controller has proven to be a game-changer in every sense of the word. Its customizable features, combined with its compatibility across multiple platforms, make it a must-have for any serious gamer looking to elevate their gameplay. My son wholeheartedly recommends this product to anyone seeking to take their gaming to the next level. With this controller in hand, the possibilities are endless, and the fun never stops.

    The updating program was a pain to use cuz it wouldn't recognize the controller if steam somehow recognizes it first. After I found a solution online it was resolved. After that it was mostly a smooth experience with the controller. Buttons and sticks feel great. The wireless mode practically has no noticable lag. Battery life is great. Ergonomically feels great to hold and the back buttons are responsive and easily programmable within the controller without the need of opening up the app/program to adjust it. Switching out the buttons/joysticks is very easy. It has no rumble but that is something I can love without to be honest.I only have 2 complaints. The buttons for the fight pad variation feels too low for me personally. It's kinda off center and a bit low reaching. Second complaint is that the triggers are extremely sensitive. You cannot rest your fingers at all on the triggers unless you want to risk accidentally pressing them. Wish they had a bit more tension to avoid that. A work around I found was to just adjust the deadzones on the triggers about half way so it's more manageable. I did this with the program on my computer that you download for this controller. The deadzones might reset when you switch the trigger locks on tho so be aware of that. If that happens just go back into  the app/program on your pc and repeat the process. Kind of an annoyance I know. Overall a good controller so far.

    Bought the Victrix Pro BFG and Dualsense Edge a few days apart with intentions of keeping only one. Honestly leaning towards the BFG as for my purposes it's just better. I have mainly played on Xbox for the past 3 console generations so I'm very familiar with the stick layout. I have gotten used to the Sony layout but still I have 8-9yrs on the Xbox layout. Also the battery life just blows the Edge away. The BFG averages around 20hrs per charge while the Edge is 4-5. Turning off the vibration and haptics to mirror the BFG still only gets like 6-7. That is on a brand new controller. I'd hate to see the battery life after a year with degradation. The Edge does feel more premium despite being $20-$25 more. Still they both feel great to me even when I switch the BFG to the Sony control layout. That freedom and better battery life will most likely be my determining factors in keeping the BFG over the Edge.Update 4/8/24: Went against my gut instinct and returned my BFG and kept the Dualsense Edge. Used it for 2 weeks and did decently but still noticably worse than I did with the BFG. Ended up buying another BFG and my first game back on Apex I dropped 10 kills and team won the match. My accuracy is just much better with the BFG. No matter what I change on the Edge, the BFG just feels better in hand to me. I do use it in the Sony layout with traditional d-pad and it just works. Plus back to having 20hr battery life is just a quality of life thing. Definitely recommend the BFG especially for shooters. For other games I use the Edge of standard Dualsense.

    The bottom buttons just don't work for my hands. I can't be harsh since it's a tall order to have double paddles line up right for everyone's fingers. My pinky wouldn't even fit on the controller so it wasn't an option to combine both middle and ring fingers on the paddles without accidentally pressing one of them. I tried using a single finger on each side for the paddles but the way I held or adjusted my controller grip during different gameplay moments just made it too inconsistent for which paddle should be the main or secondary functions. I then tried mapping both paddles to the same button but that resulted in too many double clicks happening. Disabling one or the other wasn't quite working for me since my finger resting point shifted at times.Also the lower of the 2 lower paddles is too easy to press on accident when picking up the controller after a cutscenes rest.I think it would be better if the power paddles were spaced apart where one was something like a trigger shaped button under the middle of the controller for the middle fingers while the other is a single paddle for the rings. Thing is I might think that but the controller size might be a limiting factor regardlessLast thing is in a game where the bumpers (r1 l1) requires holding will register a release since the bumpers got some wobble to it as your hands try to handle two joysticks and bottom buttons while holding. This is something I can actually regard as a universal design flaw not specific to my individual hand size or finger lengths.

    DISCLAIMER This is all my opinion, I'm sure there will be plenty of people who will love this product. My review is focused on the XBOX version, so I am comparing it to other XBOX controllers.TLDR I recommend the Gamesir G7 SE over this product  (+) already has hall effect thumbsticks  (+) paddles are more comfortable due to being flush with the shell and bigger  (+) easily available 3rd party interchangeable thumbsticks, easy to attach and very cheap  (+) actual controller is a fraction of the cost of typical premium controllersVictrix Pro BFG paddles  (-) not flush with the shell, flush paddles allow you to grip the controller better  (-) paddles are smaller to accomodate 4, better to have 2 paddles which are larger face buttons (A, B, X, Y)  (-) only the fight pad module has mechanical switches, everything else is membrane  (-) too close together because the spacing is limited by the size of the module start/select/share buttons  (+) large and easy to press, critical for games where you frequently access menus d-pad buttons  (+) large and easy to hit direction you want triggers  (+) large and easy for your finger to press at any position clutch  (+) easy to adjust trigger pull lengths bumpers  (+) easy to click for your finger at any position thumbsticks  (+) easy to change thumbsticks  (-) not hall effect  (-) I personally couldn't be as accurate as my other controllers  (-) not grippy at all  (-) tiniest thumbstick surface area out of all XBOX controllers I have used remapping  (+) easy to do through app or directly on the controller  (-) missing options on app like customizing thumbstick response curves audio settings  (-) has to be set through app instead of XBOX audio settings, which is easier audio quality  (~) I use astro mixamp so I can't comment on the audio quality color  (+) black and purple looks really good, probably one of the nicest looking XBOX  Controllers.

    The Good:  This is by far the most responsive, decisive controller I've ever purchased, with excellent remappable buttons for all buttons and triggers, not just the typical 4 buttons, Triangle, Circle, X, and Square PS style, or A, B, X, Y.  The 2 triggers used for driving games (Rocket League) can be adjusted to the level of depression as well, which makes dribbling in Rocket League much easier (I play Rocket League Primarily).  The joysticks are extremely easy to move, making sharp turns the fastest I've ever been able to accomplish, which is very important in Rocket League to cut off the ball, or turn fast when close to the ball.  The included accessories and case are top notch.  The dongle for PC eliminates the need for Bluetooth pairing, which is a great plus, as pairing Bluetooth constantly and issues with that is eliminated as well.The Bad:  The thumb grips on the control sticks could use a more rubbery surface to prevent thumb slippage while maneuvering fast, this is a problem with almost all controllers really on the market.  Also, the controller is made for small to average sized hands sadly, as that's the biggest issue I have with it.  I have very large hands, and the ends of the grips end in the middle of my palms versus a full grip that the Sonicon controller which is much larger than a standard PS4/5 controller that fits my hands superbly.  If the PDP Victrix Pro BFG was made at least 1/3rd larger in size, it would accommodate the hands of more people, particularly adults who would be the primary purchaser of such an expensive controller, but well worth it due to the GOOD that I previously mentioned.  I'd gladly pay 50 dollars more or even higher for a larger controller exactly like this present one.  I hope other companies follow Sonicon's lead in making controllers larger, as smaller controllers with back paddles that can be remapped are out of place for those of us with medium to larger sized hands.Overall:  This is easily the best controller I've ever purchased, even with it size issue, I'm learning to place my hands to make it work.  Grip extenders do not work sadly, as the shape of the grips being angular rather than round, do not fit and come off shortly after applying.  Perhaps they could make a version with the ability to extend the grips by an add on would help solve the problem for large handed individuals, but that wouldn't address the buttons being smaller or the placement of the back paddles which would still be out of place.  The real solution would be to make this same controller, just in a larger size for big handed individuals.  Till someone does address this issue, like Sonicon did (my previously favorite controller due to its size and responsiveness), I'll have to deal with the current market's limitations on their smaller sized controllers.Update:  It's JUST TOO SMALL!  I cannot adapt to this tiny controller built for children obviously or small adults.  Playing Rocket League I'm constantly backflipiping due to the buttons being too close together for my larger than a child's sized thumb.  Very frustrating trying to make it work, but in the end, this controller is flat out too small to use effectively for an adult, unless you have puny hands and fingers.  The search for an adult sized excellent controller for Rocket League continues sadly.  On to the next.

    Used it for SF6 only. Used the 6 button module on right and the thumb pad module on left. Buttons are snappy and responsive on front, top and rear. The customization software is pretty straightforward and user friendly. Switching the modules is easy with the provided tool and the case you get is cool. However, it’s too expensive for how it’s made. The silicon conductive pad under the d pad wore out in less than 6 months. The down position down right tore. Up and forward creased and was on the way to tearing as well. Waste of money since you can’t even buy replacement modules which is a huge point of a modular system. Also, 6 button module buttons need to be spaced further to the right and between each other. Could be a little bigger but that would be preference. Took awhile to get use to the setup bc of the spacing which meant many missed/wrong inputs solely due to that. Their customer service was also not very friendly or helpful when I reached out leaving me with a controller that I can’t use for what I needed which is just sitting on my desk. Very disappointed. Had to spend more money on another controller to get all I needed plus one that wouldn’t break down in 3 months. Bought the Haute 42 and been great since. Until they drop the price, improve the build quality of the thumb pad and offer modules for purchase while improving their customer support, DO NOT BUY. You can’t even buy a conductive pad to replace the one in the controller bc it’s not the size of any other PS4/5 or Xbox controller. Avoid the headache

    It might be a little early to wright a review but I think its the best controller I've ever had.  Just keep in mind I've only had this a couple of days.  Feels great in my hands.  The back buttons are in the right spots.  The sticks feel really nice.  I got the dead zones totally zeroed out.I have about 1700 hours playing Wreckfest so, maybe I'll update my review after I get some time in.  So far I'm very impressed.

    First off, if you play fighting games on pad, the Victrix is the best PS5 option currently. The Hori Octa Fighting Commander is fine in every way except for where it counts most - the D-Pad. It's way too small.The Victrix BFG here, has a WAY better D-Pad that is also customizable per ones taste. The fight button module is rather clicky, as it should be. The extra back triggers/paddles can be a bit too easy to accidentally hit, or at least the lower 2 are - so I disabled them in the software. The software itself is kinda finicky, but I set it up once and never had an issue again.For reference, I play Guilty Gear Strive, and so far I have made considerably less input errors on this pad compared to the Hori. 623 inputs always come out, although half circle inputs for supers can be finicky if I do them too fast (might be a me problem. I bound the back paddles to RC and dash Macros, and so far I haven't had any issues with hitting the wrong triggers.I would definitely recommend this to people who want a dedicated PS5 pad, although the price by itself can be hard to overcome if you just set it up for Fighting games and never swap modules like I do. This, I must give it 4 stars.

    Bought this to play fighting games on both the PC and PS5. I haven't tried it on any other type of games yet. I'm torn to give this 3 or 4 stars. My first impressions were not that good after unboxing and immediately thought I was going to just return it. I think the price holds it back from being 4 star. Should be like $140-$160 range imo. Saw a review video where the guy was flexing the controller and it sounded horrible - like it could break easily. Mine feels very solid and doesn't make those noises.The bad: Picking it up it feels ok - not cheap, but not premium or 'pro' either. The plastic feels a little sub-par all the way around the controller and the textured creator/option/function buttons look too aggressive gamer-y with the carbon fiber looking grooves. It just adds to the 'cheap looking' factor imo. It has a slower response time than most ps5 controllers running at 125hz locked polling rate which is ~8ms input lag. Main buttons on the default layout (right thumbstick and 4 main buttons) and the triggers feel ok not great. No rumble/haptics/speaker so maybe don't use this controller for ps5 exclusives. The fightpad is awesome, but very clicky (louder) buttons - Think it is going for the fight stick vibe tho which is a 'louder' way to play, but to me it just adds to the 'not pro' feeling.The good: Very comfortable in the hands and light weight. Installation and firmware update was easy. The app from the MS store works fine. The extra buttons underneath are very easy to configure on the fly or with the app. 3 profiles can be saved on the controller. Supposedly long battery life, but I can't comment on that or the wireless yet since I've only used this wired for now. 10ft long usb-c to usb-a cable that feels well built. The fightpad is actually very fun to use. The buttons feel good and tried along with the octagon gate for the left thumbstick and it was surprisingly very accurate.My Opinion: Overall, it's a kind of niche controller. While I do see the potential for fps games, if I didn't play fighting games I would just return it. Could also pickup a real fight stick for a similar price that works with both the PS5 and PC. Recommend to wait for a sale if you're interested. I hope the developers create better add-ons with higher quality stock buttons/thumbsticks and replacement parts for what we are all using now. The accuracy of this controller while I was playing fighting games does make it feel 'pro' at times.My Wish: I wish pro controllers looked more professional instead of cheap looking aggressive gamer wannabe carbon fiber buttons or the purple Fightpad text on the fightpad. Professional controllers are (usually) for adults. We don't really need the flashy lights or text or grills or whatever - just function and form in a clean build with solid components. To be fair, the controller isn't ugly, but it could look so much better.

    I've been eyeing this controller for a long time, and decided to splurge a bit. I was not disappointed at all by how it performed. Everything from the case, to the fit and finish felt premium. It's an awesome piece of hardware, that basically felt like I unlocked godmode in shooters. It reacted quickly, the controls were super tight. Even being able to custom set the trigger depth was intuitive, and paddles were excellently placed. Unfortunately I had two issues that made it a no go for me.The big one was the connectivity on my PC. Installed the app, and it did not recognize the controller. Is it something that I could have figured out given more time? Most likely. After paying for a premium product that is advertised as PC compatible I shouldn't have to jump through hoops. The second was the lack of vibration features. I thought I could  do without them, but it just felt lifeless. Also there are times where its necessary. It's def geared toward competitive players.The next iteration coming has these features included, with hall effect modules becoming available separately soon. I'm holding out for one of those, and it will likely be the absolute greatest controller ever

    really needs some extra button options. microswitches for the 4 face button + analog stick section would have been nice. extra bumpers instead of backside triggers would have been nice (like razer wolverine).no connectivity to standard xbox attachments like the chatpad. not sure why dolby audio was considered a priority when this was developed.  no rgb for xbox button.triggers are VERY sensitive - config to add deadzone is great option in the app. unfortunately, this company has 2 different controller apps on the xbox store. why? and why does one of them require register/ signup FROM WITHIN THE APP to an email address? to do controller config?

    I’ve been using other pro controllers pretty consistently for the past few years. This is by far the most weird? controller I’ve used. The looks of it are good. However it feels very cheap and is very light even compared to regular dualsense or even dual shock 4 controllers. No rumble features which is fine by me. I usually turn off vibration anyway in FPS games. No haptic triggers either which again is fine by me. However the cheap feels of the controller and the USB dongle for no latency issues along with the included fight layout module make me feel this is mainly a fight pad rather then a “pro” controller for shooters. I’m not sure if it was my luck but upon opening the box for the first time I could smell a strong smell of plastic and even after playing for about 3 hours it left a new plastic smell on my hands which I did not like. Not to mention that a modular controller has no separate modules for sale in case of stick drift which will definitely happen as the sticks are analog. The trigger locks are also very weird to set up as it has no presets in place. You kinda have to push down then release a button to do it and it’s just so weird and seems very inconvenient to switch them on the fly. I also find the smaller touch pad a bit annoying, I don’t know why but it’s just super small compared to the ps4/5 controller. At the end of the day I think it’s okay for what it is. IMO not worth the near 200 dollar price point tho.

    I find on PS5 that the sticks are very, almost too sensitive.  I have a PS5 Edge and can adjust the stick sensitivity but am told the only way to do some stick sensitivty adjustment for Victrix is to have it hooked up to PC?  This seems a hassel as it puts you in a different environment than the PS5 guessing on setting stick sensitivity correctly.  Why does Victrix not have an app to address adjustments on PS5 like Edge?

    Pros: This is a pro controller that allows you to customize your game play like no other controller on the market. If you like to play PS version of controller you have that option. If you prefer Xbox style. You have that option. Arcade style you have that option as well! and software for updates to your controller. There's a button for PS and PC. PC will give you Xbox (A,B,X,Y) output on your screen.Cons: Back buttons don't feel comfortable while playing. I find myself pushing them unnecessarily. I unmapped them since its easy to press them on accident.

    This is a great controller in my opinion, the d pad is excellent, the controller is modular, response time is excellent and battery life is excellent.  However, the software doesn't work on windows 11, the triggers are uncomfortable, your fingers keep on hitting the trigger adjustment button which gets annoying after a while, Instructions are confusing and it doesn't have vibration motors (for those who like them) and the six button module has the buttons too close together so more spacein between the buttonsis needed. All in all a great experience. I have always wanted a six button controller. This goes above and beyond my expectations

    The first controller I received was cutting in and out when I got it, and completely died within 30 minutes of opening. I had to RMA it. The new one works fine, thankfully.Pros:- The module switching feature works well, and is easy to do. Being able to bring one controller on a trip and still having access to a 2-stick layout as well as the fightpad layout is awesome.- The adjustable triggers work well, I find myself liking different setups for different games and its easy to switch them on the fly.- Tournament lock mode works well.- The case is nice.Cons:- I have serious durability concerns with this controller. The build quality feels cheap, and I already have a number of dings/scrapes on different parts. Nothing yet has functionally broken, but it seems like its only a matter of time.- The dpads are not very easy to switch out. For the smallest cross-shaped one, I had to pry it out with a screwdriver and that marred the plastic on both the dpad and the controller.- The software is slow and buggy. Nothing works quite right, and certain fields seem to reset upon opening the software, so that I have to change them every time or my controller won't be configured correctly once I close the software.- Three profiles is not enough for a controller with this much configuration. I think adding more profiles with software would be nice.Overall this gets a 3 star because I will continue to use it and be (mostly) happy with it's functionality. However, the build quality issues and software problems mean I cannot go higher than that.

    I’m a fighting game player and bought this thinking that the DPAD would perform better than the dual sense edge. But it does not, cool concept with the interchangeable buttons, and the fight stick pad is awesome too. But without a better performing d pad this isn’t very useful to me. Great concept, build quality not as bad as ppl say, also comes with a nice case, but you can’t call this a fight stick without a functional Dpad so for me, this gets 3 stars for effort but poor execution.

    The only knocks I have on this controller are that the triggers are too sensitive (I admittedly haven't checked if this can be adjusted) and it's too easy to accidentally hit the buttons that allow you to adjust the trigger stops undoing where you had them set

    First of all... To me, it has a great build in standard ps5 button layout... Very responsive, and comfortable for 1st person shooters... (COD) With that being said, I brought this controller specifically for fighting games because of it's fight stick layout and unfortunately this is it's major downfall imo... The fight pad buttons feel great but the layout is not centered right in comparison to other fight sticks or lack there of out there. Also with the 6 button layout, I was quite surprised that the R1 and R2 which is on the fight pad it's self are mirrored with the R1 and R2 at the top of the stick where as other pads in the past, the top buttons can be used for L1 and L2 on the right side of the stick... The D pads which has different options to choose from are nothing to right home about and as a amputee (left hand) this was also a major disappointment.... There has never been a D pad greater than the SNES D pad imo and when developer's are making these pads they should model it as their blueprint.... Hopefully Victrix will have some updates especially with the top triggers to map them the way you want them mapped comfortably.... Not bad but not great and at it's price point I would wait for updates or wait for a competent hori fight stick to hit the market....

    Feels good I just would like it a lot more if the remappable buttons on the back could be taken off when not needed. I'm using it for ps5 for referenc. OK so R2 L2 are hair or full triggers if yours comes with triggers in hair mode use the two buttons on the back that slide and while holding them to the side compress the triggers and hold them then release the buttons on the back and they should be in full use mode it re engage the hair trigger just slide the buttons back over without them compressed. Second it has another button on the back for wired or wireless mode wired speaks for itself wireless you have to use the USB receiver that came in the controllers case and make sure have the button on top the controller on the left in the mode you need ps5, ps4, pc. No mic on the controller just jack for headphones. No trigger feedback or rumble. But I absolutely enjoy playing with this more than any typical dualshock. The left thumb stick position always bugged me. Buttons feel good could feel better. In wireless mode u can use it both on cord or not while it charges. I just have long finger so the remappable buttons get accidentally touched at times. I've had it one day I'll update if something else is worth mentioning

    The manual doesnt really offer too much on how to replace parts with the substitute pieces, pretty responsive controller. the triggerstoppers are a great but sometimes they dont register the clicks, they’re also a bit uneven, not a drastic difference but once you notice the difference it can bother you.

    I bought this 'cuz I needed a fightpad, and have been disappointed by all the ones to come out for the last two console generations (except PDP's MKX Fightpad, and the Hori Fighting Commander [NOT Octa]).  The d-pad's not quite as responsive as I'd like, and tends to ignore diagonals during speedy motion inputs (and mine are pretty speedy).  I'd also prefer the back paddles to just not be there, but you can disable them, so that's good.  But when using the fightpad component, you can't change the right shoulder buttons to something else without changing them on the face of the fightpad component as well, so they just become utterly redundant.If you're using analog and want to use the octagonal gate to make your inputs cleaner that way, don't bother (just get a Hori Fighting Commander OCTA), 'cuz the alignment of it is sorta...diagonal.  The cardinal directions aren't where they should be, unless I just snapped it in wrong.  Doesn't feel like I did, though.But if you want a good controller for general gaming purposes, you could do worse.  But you can also just buy a much cheaper controller that's just as good, or maybe even better (DualShock/Sense d-pads are still the best d-pads, though this one does come close).Overall, I can't really recommend this controller.  Cool idea, just suboptimal execution at too steep an asking price.

    10 week, 100+ hour review:It’s been a good “pro” controller so far. I haven’t had many problems at all with it. There was one time that it disconnected while in the middle of a match but just that once. No issues with stick drift so far.I have average/medium size hands and it fits them comfortably. The back buttons are excellent, I only wish they were mechanical buttons. The placements of them are perfect though. I really  hope they or another company end up selling hall effect stick replacement modules. Or at the very least I hope they make regular replacement modules availableIt doesn’t feel cheap to me like some reviews have stated. I’m not sure where they are getting that. Opinions huh.I love the short travel option on the triggers. They work well and it’s the only configuration I use them in.I updated the controller and dongle with the windows app and there has seemingly been a good improvement on battery life.Overall I’m happy with it but there is room for improvement.

    This controller is phenomenal and awful at the same time.Cons: First of all the build, this is one of the cheapest ""pro"" controller ever. It feels cheap the triggers sound like cheap plastic. Like if dropped it would crack cheap. It feels like the 3rd party controllers of the past that were $40 to $60. For almost $200 with taxes it should not feel this cheap.The L2 and R2 Triggers are in an awful spot and hard to not press when you are running in Call of Duty. I tried every trigger setting and even maxed out the dead zone settings in the game. Nothing worked right. I have not had this problem on any controller made in the last 20 years, from PS5, Xbox, and or Nintendo.  I have pretty average hands so not sure why that is an issue.Pros: This controller is super responsive, and the sticks are perfect. Fitting Kontrol freaks for xbox is a bonus here. The trigger stops are my favorite in any controller.As a fighter controller this is second to none with the 6 button layout option.If I could just eliminate the accidental trigger presses this would have gotten a 5.

    I currently play on PC and have used the xbox one controller since 2014 but this PS5 controller is honestly way better.- For bigger hands like mine, this one fills your hands. If you ever used the ps4 controller you know what I mean. Theres no fatigue after 30 minutes because the controller keeps your hands at a comfy position.- The tech is impressive, the trigger feedback thing is wild. Playing Helldivers the trigger starts to get harder to pull as I run out of ammo. And yes this is on PC connected through bluetooth.Id highly recommend this controller to anyone either in need of an upgrade or just a new controller.

He likes all the software features you're able to change on the console with custom profiles. He did say It's WAY overpriced compared to other controller prices. He also said the battery on the controller doesn’t last more than like 7 hours so you will have to charge it a lot. They need to improve that feature.

    Solid black and bland. Came time to replace a launch DualSense, and I wanted something different than the default white/black. The DualSense color lineup is dreadful, and fun colorways a seem to come near the end of Sony console cycles. Regardless, went with the solid black with every intention of customizing. So far, I've just added a brushed metal accent trim shell, but it really lifts the controller's aesthetic. Going to do thumbsticks and touchpad cover next.

    That's the PlayStation 5 controller design. The cover console, is original. That is a black console by 'faceplate', I left the reverse cover, because it is windowed with the PlayStation (relief). The 'mmidnight' controller, (not pictured) is black.As a companion console (no disk), these include a bid, to install downloaded games from other Asia companies,. Even though my company won the bid, it produced a more complete product within the US, (with disk player). The console disks insert readable surface up, that retailed at around 500$.

    If you need to replace one of your controllers or my case you only have one, I recommend getting this PS five controller caveat because it’s a Sony controller it’s going to cost you $70. Back in the day you could get them for $40-$50 but not anymore; you’re looking at $70 a controller.

    Welcome to the world of gaming, where this controller is determined to be the underdog with a heart of gold – or maybe just gold spray paint. Sure, it has decent range, but in terms of build quality, it's the equivalent of a celebrity chef serving you instant ramen. It's like the Xbox 360 controller's long-lost sibling who got a quick makeover with some modern-age mascara.Feeling cheap? Check. It's so budget-friendly that it probably pays rent to your wallet. But hey, it's not all bad – it's like holding nostalgia in your hands, only if nostalgia came with a receipt. The 2.5GHz connection is here to assure you that it won't bail on you mid-game, unlike that flaky friend who always conveniently loses connection during a crucial match.And let's talk about the dongle – a word that's just as fun to say as it is to own. With a 2.5GHz connection, this dongle is less of a hassle than untangling earphones. It's the unsung hero of the gaming world, silently doing its job without stealing the spotlight.In conclusion, if you're on a budget and want a controller that screams, ""I'm here for a good time, not a long time,"" this might be your joystick soulmate. It's the rebel of the gaming world, wearing its cheapness like a badge of honor – or maybe just a sticker from the dollar store. Game on, thrifty gamers! 🎮💸

    Love the MSI controller, best one I've used so far.PROs:It works right out of the box. no setup or fighting with any hidden settings or connections to get it to work.It stays connected during useIt even has a power save mode that will shut it off after not being used for a while which made me panic the first time as my last controller was a nightmare to get reconnected.The USB dongle that it comes with makes it so much easier to use and reconnecting is an absolute dream.Just push the center dragon logo button and boom, it wakes up and instantly reconnects.CONs:This one is very minor, sometimes one of the buttons makes a slight squeak sound from my finger sliding across the super smooth button surface.Seriously that is my only complaint so far.I've used it for Phasmophobia, Mortal Kombat 11, Hollow Cocoon, over the past week or so since I got it and it is fantastic.  It is so nice to have a wireless controller that actually connects and has a decent range (I've not found a limit to it yet, I can play at a comfortable relaxed distance from my desk.Final thoughts, I love it, and highly recommend this MSI controller.I think some complaints were about needing the USB dongle and needing to carry two things with you if you bring it somewhere with you, but honestly having it makes this such a better controller to use.  A serious improvement to quality of life in my opinion.

    I don't always read 100% of the description on an item before I buy, but this one surprised me in one way that I'll get to in the positives.Overall, very good feeling controller. It has a slightly rough matte finish for a decent grip, and even better, it has lines in the triggers and bumpers to catch your fingers. They definitely feel inexpensive, but they work well to catch your grip, which is great.The controller is rechargeable, which its companion, a first-party X-Box controller, is not. This is mostly good with a little bit of bad, because there's no battery bay to open up and replace, and even if there were, it would be a proprietary Li-Ion that would be impossible to find in 5-10 years anyway. For the price, definitely worth it!It mostly feels solid like a real X-Box controller, and even has rubber grips on the sides, which the name-brand sure doesn't! The buttons are all in the right place and the shoulders are nice and clicky, while the triggers resist just enough to feel like you can slowly pull them back.That's all for naught compared to the coolest feature of this controller: Hot-swappable digital pad! The analog sticks are perfectly fine, but the D-pad is a dream. You can swap out the standard plus-sign with a ""pro controller"" type multi-directional disk easily due to it being magnetic. You heard me, it clicks on with MAGNETS (how do they work?). Both options are actually quite weighty as they're made of metal, not plastic.Now, there are some minor issues, like the non-replaceable battery situation, as well as the fact that it requires a dongle (heh, ""dongle"") to operate with your PC rather than just a built-in Bluetooth, but that's pretty minor so far. That said, they shouldn't discourage you from grabbing this well-built controller that easily competes with its first-party version!

    Decent controller. Seems well built. Not too heavy or light. So far it's responsive and relatively accurate.....but.....NOT USB-C which makes no sense being 2023, NO storage for the dongle so therefore cumbersome to travel with and the battery is NOT removable/replaceable so more plastic in the landfills once it stops charging. Probably should have bought a Microsoft controller but I am a MSI fan and wanted to give it a try. Lesson learned.

    The controller works well.  Have no real problems except for the D-pad.  It is TERRIBLE!  I play a lot of tactical rpgs so they're on a grid and it's easier to navigate them with a D-pad vs the analog stick but the D-pad on this is just so bad.  It has an interchangeable pad thing you can put on...the standard D-pad and a sort of analog-ish pad.  So instead of pushing down on the pad, you just push it in the direction like an analog stick which I guess explains why the regular D-pad is so bad. So that's my main complaint with this controller.

    This has been a pretty decent 7th gen controller for casual PC gaming with a good all day battery. It's what I wish the Xbox 360 controller was like. Quality could be better but I wasn't exactly expecting premo quality for the price. The buttons & sticks could have been better. My A button came a bit loose(still works just rattles allot) also stick response can lag a bit at times on certain games like No Mans Sky & trigger & bumper buttons feel a bit sticky & bumper buttons make a loud clicky noise when pressed. I also wish the charger port was USB C instead of USB Micro but it is basically a 7th gen controller so I wasn't really expecting it to have USB C.

    The seller claims the device has Bluetooth connectivity. It does not. Not cool. I specifically was looking for an MSI Game Controller that uses Bluetooth like this seller claimed this device uses.I have limited USB ports to use with this wireless gaming controller USB dongle. And some OS platforms might have driver problems. Also, the USB dongle is just one more small piece of hardware to lose.The gaming controller does work on Windows 11 and the materials and engineering are good. It's just not the Bluetooth connectivity device the seller claims it is. Not cool.

    Apart from its micro-USB connector (really, still?), this has all the makings of an outstanding value controller. The stick accuracy exceeds much more expensive units, which is particularly useful in the racing games I play (FH5, NFS, etc.). I really like this controller and would not hesitate to give it five stars if not for the following issues.My unit frequently gets stuck on vibration--rumbling when there's nothing to rumble, even in the pause menu. I had to reset the controller several times a session. Then, the rumble almost completely died and became little more than a distracting rattle. More than an immersion enhancement, vibration is necessary for a good racing experience, as it provides feedback on tire grip and shift times. The rumble has since returned for now, but it still gets stuck a half-dozen times a session, at least.I figured I just got unlucky and wanted to exchange the controller for a new one. While the issue occurred within the first two months of ownership, I was past my Amazon return window. So, when the rumble died, I went to MSI for an RMA. However, I refuse to pay to ship an RMA. Faulty products not caused by the customer should be the company's responsibility entirely. MSI's representatives clearly cared very little about my issue. As such, the whole experience left a bad taste. If MSI had agreed to provide a shipping label, this very well could be a five-star review.Should you try it? Maybe. The controller is otherwise an excellent product, and you may have better luck than me. But I just can't in good conscience give this a positive rating based on my personal experience.

    So out of the handful of xbox/pc controllers I have, this is by far my favorite. So the only issue I have with this is that with any sudden drops and the d-pad falls off. Maybe they should have used a different type of magnet or mechanism for the swappable d-pads. Works with almost every game I have, and can be temporarily remapped with 3rd party software. Great battery life and leds are not crazy bright and distracting.

    Un producto que cumple con lo prometido, sin problemas y lo detecta el Sistema Operativo sin mayores complicaciones. Funciona de maravilla y te da muchas horas de juego. Puedes pasar semanas sin cargarlo si solamente juegas casual una o dos horas al día. Al tener un diseño basado en el control de xbox 360 la ergonomía no es la mejor, pero sin llegar a ser una tortura o algo incómodo. Simplemente un control de xbox one es mucho mas ergonómico. Le doy 4 estrellas solo por el tema de la ergonomía, pero sin duda es una excelente  compra de la cual no se arrepentirán.

    A bit of false advertising, as far as I can tell the controller does not connect via bluetooth but with a USB dongle. Also my computer screen will not sleep while the dongle is plugged in. This is a known issue you can find on several message boards. Other than that, the controller works well and feels good in hand.

    This is a solid wireless xbox controller that feels and plays great, the trigger buttons are a little springy feeling but they're easy to get used to and the wireless connection is rock solid.

    My gaming laptop was ruined when my upstairs neighbor flooded his apartment and it just happened to come streaming down on my laptop... Anyways, all I have to work with now is my Google Pixel Slate, which runs Chrome OS and only has 2 type C USB ports. I bought a multi adapter dongle for type C which includes 3x USB 3.0, 1x Type C, and 1x HDMI. The controller works flawlessly via the wireless dongle attached to my adapter. FYI, Chrome OS is the worst when it comes to controllers and you HAVE to have a wireless connection, any wired connection and the mapping will be completely incorrect.I am a 100 percent cloud gamer... I use Nvidia GeForce Now and Boosteroid. This controller works GREAT with both applications, and no input lag or latency.The interchangeable Dpad is a great feature and it utilizes a very strong magnet. I haven't had any issue with either of the Dpads.I'm used to using an Xbox controller, and in comparison the MSI controller feels a bit small and took a little bit of getting used to. I also think it feels a bit slippery even though it has a grippy surface on the back. The analog sticks are very firm with no play whatsoever, but I feel like the sticks themselves are a bit skinny and don't have that dense feel like in an xbox controller. The triggers are textured and extremely responsive... no complaints with the triggers.

    The controller itself is fantastic. I love the look, the way it feels, the way it controls, etc., and especially the price for full wireless capability.As some have mentioned the USB ""dongle"" or wireless stick is a bit larger than one would expect, but I haven't had any issues with it.The two main flaws I've noticed are:- The USB dongle doesn't have anywhere to be stored in the controller itself. If you plan to use this as a ""portable"" controller, and not leave the USB plugged in all the time, this might be a big deal for you. It'd be nice to have a place to store the USB in the controller itself when it's not plugged in so it doesn't get lost.- The USB charging uses an older, outdated USB-micro cord and port. It is not the universal, standardized USB-C. All my currently chargeable devices use the same USB-C cord and port, and I only need a USB-micro cord for this controller.The above two things added together make this controller mildly inconvenient to own, and feel like they could be resolved in future designs.

    Having grown up on the NES and SNES, I was happy to see an entirely new 2D entry in the mainline mario series. After the phenomenal Super Mario Odyssey easily became my family's favorite video game during the pandemic, we were somewhat disappointed with the remakes that have been released since. It was an easy choice to pre-order Super Mario Wonder, but I was doubtful the experience could compare to Odyssey, despite more emphasis on co-op play.Gameplay:From the start screen, the essence of Mario games is captured perfectly in Super Mario Wonder. Levels oscillate between familiar terrains and novel landscapes. Most mario games offer something new that at first seems like it will disrupt the always-solid platforming experience and genius level design hallmark to 2D mario adventures. Wonder includes several new power-ups, an overwhelming number of one-at-a-time badges provide a small change in-stage, and the wonder flower induces brief level-warping or mario-warping mini-challenges. None of these are affect the game on the level of Oydssey's Cappy or Mario Sunshine's FLUDD. However, they are all interesting and worthy additions. They also allow for a solo base difficulty that is decidedly more challenging (as you get further into the game) than many other 2D Mario games. Yet, the game (as you would expect) is adaptive to a wide range of player skill because of the co-op, invincible characters (that don't need to be unlocked), new power-ups, and badges. Still, I do miss the simplicity of the platforming challenges hallmark to Mario games, which aren't quite as much on display here as compared to collecting star coins in New Super Mario Bros.Graphics:Graphically, the game delivers as much as the hardware allows. Detailed environments and distinct aesthetics for each world are evident. It can be a bit busy, but always fun. The level of polish is as good as any Mario game, which already sets the bar high. Character animations, character model design, enemy design, and effects, all add greatly to the experience.Controls:The controls, for the most part, are what you'd expect from a Mario title: reliable. Yet, during some platforming, my kids experienced issues they blamed on lagging response. It could have been that they were sitting too far from the Switch or that they are kids. I didn't notice any issues with input lag or imprecision. I also love that Nintendo just 2 core (run and jump) buttons are needed most of the time, supplementing with the top-right bumper button (or, alternatively, shaking the control) on occasion.Co-op:The co-op mode is where ""Super Mario Wonder"" truly attempts to bridge the generational gap. Collaborating with my children, combining our abilities to face challenges, is a great way to spend time together. The characters that don't receive damage from enemies make it easy for novices to contribute to the progress and keep up with more advanced players.Overall Assessment:Super Mario Wonder delivers on combining many of the most beloved and nostalgiac components of former 2D Mario adventures while avoiding the trap of feeling like an updated version of a previous game. My kids enjoyed the new features more than I did, with my 8-year old laughing hysterically every time I hop along as a crouched elephant Mario. I'll update as we continue our adventure...

The competitive mode is also a blast for some healthy family rivalry.Nostalgia Factor:Being a lifelong Mario fan, I appreciate the nods to the franchise's history. Mario Wonder Switch includes various references and throwbacks to earlier titles, making it a nostalgia trip for me. It's a pleasure to share these moments with my kids and tell them about the good old days of gaming.Replay Value:The game's extensive content and collectibles add significant replay value.

    The Super Mario Bros.™ Wonder brings a wave of nostalgia, making it a must-have for fans of the iconic Nintendo franchise. From the charming characters to the vibrant graphics, this game encapsulates the magic that made Mario a household name.The gameplay is engaging, with clever level design and a delightful mix of classic elements and innovative twists. The controls are responsive, providing a seamless experience for players of all skill levels. The inclusion of various power-ups and surprises adds an extra layer of excitement, keeping the adventure fresh and entertaining.However, one aspect that could be improved is the soundtrack. While the familiar tunes are there, the overall audio quality doesn't quite match the brilliance of the visuals. Some tracks sound a bit tinny, and for those who hold the original game's music close to their hearts, this might be a bit disappointing.Despite this minor audio hiccup, Super Mario Bros.™ Wonder is a joyous journey into the Mushroom Kingdom that will captivate both longtime fans and new players alike. It's a delightful addition to any gaming collection, offering a charming blend of classic and contemporary Mario magic.

    Mario has always been present in my life. My first serious interactions that my memory recalls is from Super Smash Bros Melee, he was the headliner, the face of Nintendo, but I still would rather play as Link. I dabbled here and there with the 2D games often getting too frustrated with them and not feeling enough of a hook to continue with the harder levels, let alone beat the whole game.My first Mario game that I really played through and throughly enjoyed was Mario Odyssey. A great 3D plat-former. I wouldn’t put it up there with my all time favorites but I had a great time with it.When Nintendo revealed Super Mario Bros Wonder back a few months ago, I shrugged it off and made no plans to play it (I was salty about the lack of a Wind Waker port announcement being made on Switch and still am). But I had been hearing some buzz about it and thought I’d pick it up as a birthday gift to myself sense I hadn’t been playing any games as of late.All that to say, this game is simply wonderful. “Wonder” was the perfect title for this game. It had such a sense of joy, and glee about its creativity and is a celebration of what Mario is. You really get a sense of how much everyone who worked on this game really love what they do. They made something truly special.The gameplay is tight, responsive, challenging, and a blast to play. The level design is out of this world creative, second to none, can’t think of a game that has done it better, the graphics are gorgeous, and the music is perfect.I’m not the best at 2D platformers so I struggled with a few of the levels, and I can’t really compare the difficulty level with this and other Mario’s, but I’m going to have to go back and play some other 2D titles now.Overall, I highly recommend this game. It’s a joy to play and really brings back what games are supposed to be about: fun gameplay and a fun experience with none of the strings attached like the rest of the gaming landscape right now.10/10

    I've been a fan of Nintendo since the original came out in the 80's. Had the original, Super, 64 and Wii, now I have Switch. I've played a lot of Mario games and by far this Mario game is the best. The graphics are awesome, I love the interaction. You can play with folks from around the world or with friends, however I choose to play by myself for now. It has a little bit of nostalgia feel to it as the worlds have a nice length to it and you are grabbing coins, old bad guys that now sing as well as try to kill you.  And then it's mixed with 2024 with playful interactions and new warp worlds that are fun and exciting to get through. You can also change characters to get a feel of what they each can do which is turn into an elephant all except the Yoshis. I haven't finished the game yet, I'm still exploring and going back into the worlds I've already finished to see if I missed anything. But this game is definitely worth it. You won't be disappointed.

    Fantastic game really. The new power ups, Elephant, Bubble and especially Drill, are delightful and I hope most make it into successive games (Elephant was a bit OP, but I’d love to continue seeing bubble and drill, especially in a fully 3D Mario). Lots of new challenges and secrets to find. A pseudo trophy system made it fun to “100%” the game (not super easy to do, but not the hardest either), the Switch needs a trophy system or some such implemented badly, a miniature version coming built into Mario just illustrates it all the more. The different characters were nice, but not as exciting as I’d hoped. I wished there were more differences between them and the fact that Yoshi and the … Rabbit? Were basically the easy setting (although at the cost of the power ups, does make them kinda boring) for the game was actually disappointing (I really wanted to play as Yellow Yoshi, but I didn’t want the handicap of not taking damage or basically never having issues making a jump. I’d rather an actual setting for that). While I was playing, I had tons of fun, but I have to say, the games true downside … it’s a full priced sidescroller. It’s great fun, but I won’t be indulging in that for myself again tbh. I’ll wait for the sales. There feels like 0 incentive to go back and replay anything. No multiplayer game modes (you can play multiplayer, but as far as I’m aware it doesn’t offer anything in the way of a party game), so I’m probably never going to touch it (and I’m an obsessive collector so I’m disinclined to sell). It didn’t take me too much actual play time, and much of that was replaying stages to 3 star, if all I’d cared about was the story (which was fun!) I woulda been done much sooner - that’s why the switch needs a trophy system, Nintendo’s own games would get more out of one than any of the third party, just doesn’t hold up to that price point the way recent Zelda or Mario Odyssey do. Not saying side scrollers aren’t fun, they’re a blast, we need them to stick around, but you just don’t get as much game for the money you pay and that should be addressed.

    Combines the fun Mario side scroll with bizarre and interesting levels. I played this game with my 2 sons and we had a blast exploring the levels and beating the game. We replay Mario U AND (3D) world and wonder has that same type of replay ability.

    Another Mario game that hits it right out of the park and wins over another generation.  I absolutely loved playing this game as has my 19 year old son.  There is so much to be discovered and so many surprises.Nintendo brings the most attention to detail and so many little touches that old school Nintendo gamers like myself love to see.  From the 8 but nods and music to the 80's throw back rock music to all of the ""enemies"" brought back to life.Another absolutely enjoyable, nostalgic yet fresh game for everyone!

    I’m a lifelong gamer and have recently been allowing my 6yo to join me. This game was such a cute and fun way for us to spend quality time together! I love playing as Yoshi so that she can jump on my back and I can carry her through any really tricky parts. This is the perfect game for parents to play with kids!

    I’ve been playing Nintendo for ages. Unfortunately as you get older, your reflexes slow down and sometimes some of the newer games are just too hard. This one was cute, fun and had lots of different kinds of levels.  Graphics were beautiful and smooth. Most importantly it was challenging but not so much that it was frustrating. Lots of little secrets to find. Even the credits were fun. I enjoyed this very much!

    So I have to say that I was almost disappointed months ago to learn that Nintendo was making another 2D Mario game. The first thought I had was why are they not making a Super Mario Odyssey II!? Which I’ve still not given up hope for. When I discovered it was going to be a 2D at this point the trailer had not been released so we didn’t know it was the Wonder version & just how phenomenal it was going to be. I was assuming it would be something similar to the Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe which I lost interest in. As soon as the trailer for Wonder was released I said to my husband I’m buying it. Pre ordering it right now. Just prior to seeing the trailer I had told him I wouldn’t be buying the new 2D game because I was that upset it wasn’t Odyssey II or any 3D Mario game. I’m so glad I decided to purchase this game. First I must mention that it was delivered to our door the SAME DAY the game was released. My husband & I played it immediately & were instantly obsessed!!!!!! This is the most beautiful Mario game to date. I love it equally as much as I do Super Mario Odyssey which is saying a lot. I wish it was just as long as Odyssey though. So I guess that would be my only complaint. While it’s definitely not a short game - I do wish it was longer because I love it that much. I just never want it to end. I’d say many of us are still hoping for an Odyssey II one of these days but this will definitely help in passing the time while the world waits for it!!! Get this game. You won’t be disappointed. 10/10

    This is not the US version game. Switch games are not locked to any specific region but to say this is a US version is false advertising. However, I’m able to play the game no problem so far. If you are ok saving $10 for a non-us version this is a good choice but, again, this is not a US version game

    the art style and the direction they took with animations makes this game pop. Mario Wonder has a different feel from  the ""New Super Mario Bros"" series. Mario Wonders stage select is like mario 3d world on the wii u. so a bit of nostalgia hit me. the sound track is also great, as always. with many playable characters. Daisy is back and finally in 2D. i hope to see more of her in the future. mario wonder has my hopes up for ""Princess Peach: Showtime!""

    After having read the reviews I was skeptical to say the least. However, the game is every bit as good as people say is (after beating the first major castle) the scenery is gorgeous, the game play is smooth and extremely reminiscent of the old Super Mario World for the NES. If you (like me) have been waiting for a true next step in the chapter from Super Mario World, this is it. This will bring a whole new generation into the fold of loving the classic, original, epic game play that is Super Mario. I rarely say this about any game, but, it’s a MUST PLAY for all ages.

    OK so I love this game, it brings a lot of new art and fun to the table. It does seem, at least to me, to be very easy, but at the same time it's possible I've just gotten way too good at Mario games. But this may mean no matter what skill level you have or don't, you will have a lot of fun and for some of you, you may have a bit of a challenge. I've yet to try multiplayer as I have no friends (JK) but I understand it's like the NSMB multiplayer except you can't throw your friends or bump into them, so I dunno. In Single player, you can play whatever character you want, so if you want to go through the whole game as a pretty Princess who turns into a Princess Elephant, you can do that. They have some easy mode players as well that don't die when hit by enemies, and if you use them, that can be our little secret. I also want to point out that this game is roughly the same size as my all time favorite, Mario 3, even though somehow it feels like I'm zipping through this game really fast compared to that one. I did the comparison so you didn't have to. There are a good number of regular levels + some bonus levels, like the one where you race a caterpillar for some reason. There's also some funky stuff that you may already know about, so I'll let you just discover all that on your own.

    For a cheap keyboard, this thing is great. I have the old school looking one with the brown switches and out of the box it feels pretty good. The brown switches are bit mushy but at the price I really can't complain. It feels good enough and for typing I think it's great. I am going to be using this in an office setting so I needed a keyboard that didn't look like Las Vegas at night, so this fits the bill perfectly. The only real negative I can think of is that the backlight does not shine though the keys. But this keyboard is great value. Recommended.

    The keyboard is amazing! I love that they give you extra keycaps and let you choose how it looks.But for me at least, some of the keys have bad printing and one of the kick stands will fall if you push the keyboard slightly. Im pretty the kick stand is just a defect, but I think the keycaps having bad printing is most likely going to be for all the keyboards. But the sound of the stabilizers are so good! The RGB is mid but I didn't buy this keyboard expecting for the best.

    I loved this keyboard for the first few months. I am a casual gamer, so I didn't need anything high-end or fancy. I wanted a mechanical, aesthetic keyboard. It fit my budget and needs because the keys sounded great and it looked nice with my setup. The lighting was pretty cool too and I love typing on it. However, after about 7 months, the entire right side has stopped lighting up. I'm not sure why, but none of those keys light up anymore. Other than that, the keys still type and I've had no other issues with it.

    It feels premium and typing on it is very satisfying. It's got lots of light modes, I keep it on the one that only lights up the light under the key that's pressed.The only downside I see to the keyboard is that the backlighting doesn't pass through the keys -- the letters on the key caps don't let any light through, meaning no light passed through them either. So, if being able to see the letters on the keys in the dark is a must for you, I'd say this keyboard isn't for you. For me, it's not a problem because I don't look at the keyboard when I type, and so in the dark, once I know where my hands are (the backlighting allows a silhouette of the keys), I'm good to go from there.

    I bought this keyboard because I was on the hunt for an affordable small one that could fit in my laptop bag for classesFor the first couple of months, it was working really well without issue. But sometimes during gaming or other tasks the thing will just randomly disconnect and keep typing the last letter pressed, or in this case in game, it keeps the character moving forward. The only way to fix this is to unplug and plug it back in again.Other than that really, I have been happy with the keyboard and how quiet it is. But in the future it makes me unsure of buying from the brand because I don't know if this is just a faulty keyboard or a widespread thing.If you love tactile keyboards, this will put you right at home wherever you go!

    When I was a teenager on a tight budget just getting into computers, I would have loved to have a keyboard like this. But Ive used much better keyboard then this since then.You really get what you pay for. A cheap, generic mechanical keyboard that 'Mageegee' chose the keycaps for, and slapped their logo on. (The 'bar' with the company logo, and two indicator lights above the arrow keys is a big tell)The key switches are inconsistent, the keycaps are cheap, with bad light passthrough, it came with some extra red keycaps to customize the look, but those keycaps don't let the light through and some were for a numberpad which being a TKL, this doesn't have. The hardwired cable is kinda short at ~5 feet.Don't get me wrong though. I would take this in an instant over the rubber dome keyboards that come with your typical PC. The switches are responsive, the keys don't jam, the typing experience is overall not bad. Its just if you spend a bit more, you can find a much better keyboard.If you are just looking for a cheap spare keyboard that you won't actively hate every time you pull it out, this ain't a bad choice.

    I genuinely really love this keyboard the keys feel very responsive and ""clicky"" my only issue is its hard to tell which key you're pressing sometimes because the letter/symbols are really clear and difficult to see with and without the backlight. But its not a huge issue if you've spent hours playing games and have memorized where each key is.

    The tactile keys feel nice and the keyboard is cheaply made but seems decent for the price. No idea how long it'll last. The keyboard is backlit but the black/white version does not have transparent key symbols so if the lighting is dark enough, you won't be able to see the symbols. Lighting seems to only be white as advertised, in case you're hoping the 19 advertised lighting effects include other colors.For under $30, this is all very reasonable. If you need a keyboard to last a little while until you can afford a good one, like me, this is a decent option. If you aren't a cave-dwelling animal who hates light like me, the lack of transparent key symbols won't be an issue.

    I use this for playing games and writing emails.  It has a good feel and a satisfying click if you like that.  I have read a lot of reviews saying that people have trouble with the windows key.  If it doesn't work just press FN+WIN, this will unlock the windows key and make it usable again. There are two lights next to the logo above the arrow keys, the upper lights indicates CAPS lock and the other indicates WIN lock. Hope this helps enjoy the keyboard

    I'm not sure how this holds up compared to more expensive mechanical keyboards. This is the first mechanical keyboard that I've ever owned. It definitely has the feel of a mechanical keyboard, so whether or not you find much practicality in it, at least you're getting your money's worth. I'm a gamer, and despite how much I've seen mechanical keyboards recommended over the years for gaming, I can't say that it makes much of a difference.The lighting on the keyboard is dimmable(and can be turned off completely), and it's not too bright to be annoying in any way, even in a dark room. I honestly can't stand people who have a gaming setup that looks like some sort of lightshow.It's a 75% keyboard, meaning that it doesn't have a number pad. If you're don't have a lot of space on your desk, it's pretty useful.I saw another review mentioning how the font looks weird, and I have to agree. It also seems like the lighting doesn't evenly distribute through the keys, leaving some parts of each character having dim spots. It doesn't make much of a difference to me though, because I don't care much for keyboard lighting, but it does make you question the quality of the product.Lastly, the manual included with the product has a few spelling mistakes, indicating that whoever wrote it was not a native english speaker.

    I didn't realize that backlit meant lights under the keycaps, but the letters aren't illuminated (only around the keys, but not through the keys). Impossible to type in the dark, turning backlight off makes it much easier to type.  Otherwise it seems like a pretty nice keyboard.

    I think this is an excellent choice for a wired mechanical keyboard.  My only complaint is that the F and J keys don't have the bumps so you can locate your hands on the keyboard.  I learned that this is a trait of gaming keyboards since F and J aren't generally important for gaming.  Even so, I just bought a separate set of cheap key caps and replaced these two keys.  I do more typing than gaming so I want normal keys.  This is just a minor inconvenience.  I would buy this again.

    I honestly don't get all of the noise complaints, keyboard is great. Sound is moderate at best, no one else in my house can hear it. Keys feel smooth, and are easily changeable. For the price of this keyboard I'd buy 10 more if I needed them. 10/10 would buy again

    If you are in the market for a under $50 mechanical keyboard this is a pretty good option. Some nice RGB/LED lighting. Hot swappable keys and the keyboard comes with keycaps for you to swap out if you like.Certainly not the best keyboard on the market and it sits a little too high for me

    The keyboard itself looks great and the material feels quite nice to the touch, I bought the white and blue variant and it works pretty well so far, the only things are that the color is a lot less saturated and vibrant than the one depicted in the pictures, looking more like a blueish light gray rather than light blue most of the times, especially when the lighting in the room isn't ideal, with poor lighting you almost can't even tell the blue and white keys apart from each other, and also it is way noisier than expected, especially the spacebar for some reason, but being a budget keyboard it works pretty well and does its job just fine.

    I think the keyboard is definitely worth the $25 I spent on it. I bought it to match my new white PC build while I decide which keyboard I want to order, so it is satisfactory for temporary use. I don't like it for gaming, tbh. It's a little clunky and slow for me.One star knocked off because the 'm' key doesn't work 90% of the time! I've tried to clean/lube the switch and idk man. Just a defect I guess.I don't really care about the lighting effects, but I know some will. They have all the usual effects, but note you cannot change the color. I got the blue/white and the backlight is blue.

    So I got this keyboard as a quick replacement for my last keyboard which had a switch die, and I do not have the soldering know how so it was just more convenient to replace it. First time using a linear switch, I have to say I am a fan of this yellow switch. It's very smooth overall after using it for a few days and not too light either. I was used to a clicky blue switch previously, so the overall sound experience is arguably an improvement.I did a few modifications to make the keyboard feel and sound better, added some foam to the bottom of the case, rubber o-rings for the keycaps (double ringed the spacebar, really made a difference for that), and lastly a strange one but: masking tape applied to the bottom part of the PCB, this gives the keys like a ""poppier"" sound though I'd say things even out with the other modifications.For the money this is definitely a worthwhile option, I kind of wish it had a Hotswap PCB but that's not something you'll typically see at this price point; and if you do I heard they don't have full switch support outside of a handful of manufacturers.

    This would've been a 5 star product if it weren't for the caps lock key to be broken upon opening the package. I used one of the other color keys that the keyboard came with to replace it, now I have two esc on my keyboard. Even so, I love the colors and the feel of the one I ordered. A good mechanical keyboard for its price, the keyboard body is durable and very portable thanks to its size. The last thing I will say is that the brightness of the keyboard is the right intensity, doesn't hurt the eyes and even if I leave it on at night my eyes barely pick up the light.

    Best bang for your buck keyboard, I’m going to be switching over soon to a more expensive keyboard but after a couple months using this it really wasn’t bad at all I just have big fingers and feel the keys have a little too much give for me, but for a beginner or someone who likes a softer touch of the keys this is the perfect keyboard and they come in lots of nice colorways

10/10 keyboard only problem is cannot turn led off unless the device it is plugged into is off. The closest you can get to solving this is to put the led on single key touch sensitive which means when you touch the key it lights up. Buy this!!

    [black/white/orange keycaps, brown switches]Update:  No problems after 70 days usage.  At this price level, it's a very good starter mechanical keyboard, or a fun gift for someone who appreciates computer peripherals.Good deal for the price (~25 bucks, on sale).  A good to very good starter mechanical keyboard. Keys feel nice enough. 5 stars compared to other mechanical keyboards at this price level (under $30), or 4 stars compared to slightly better quality keyboards costing $40 to 60.This cheap mechanical keyboard is as good as _some_ more expensive ones I've used. If you are looking for best 'bang for your buck', or a starter mech keyboard for a youngster, then Magegee's offerings are usually a good place to look.Notes:Not quite as pictured. Comes with black and white keycaps ONLY attached (no orange ones attached). The few included orange keycaps come in a plastic bag. Also included is the cheapest possible (but functional) plastic key puller. Keys are easy to swap.Works fine for a keyboard at this price level. No bad keys after 1 week use  (update:  no problems after 70 days).Would we buy again?  At this price (sub 25 bucks):  YES.A removable USB cord should've been a feature here, but it's not. The USB cord is permanently attached, which we knew before purchasing -- so no points deduction, in spite of the seller cheaping out on a 17-cents feature.

    I am a bit hard on my equipment. But I’d say pretty confidently that I didn’t have any spills or accidents around the keyboard.After a couple months of use…“T” key started missing punches and I  tried taking it out and dusting out the switch. Still no luck. Currently collecting dust in my closet :(Don’t think I’ll be buying another.

    This review is for the ""MageGee 75% Mechanical Gaming Keyboard with Blue Switch, LED Blue Backlit Keyboard, 87 Keys Compact TKL Wired Computer Keyboard for Windows Laptop PC Gamer - Grey/Black"". I mainly program on the computer I got this for. I'm not young and have had buckling spring, membrane, scissor and the occasional mechanical. This is definitely a mechanical and these are definitely blue switches. If you're not familiar with them they're the loud clicky ones really good for typing. If you're a kid or gaming, get reds, not these. Otherwise they will seem really loud. Build quality is excellent and sturdy. Was relieved it doesn't have red keycaps on as I dont like the look. I was extremely partial to the old IBM keyboards, but the re-releases go for 150$. This is ballpark and having to pay 25$ on sale was pretty nice. Its 14"" across with no numpad which is a pretty good space saver and the key backlighting is there without being overpowering.

    I love how quiet, yet tactile the the keys feel. I am a developer and it's probably not the best keyboard you can find on the market, but it's honestly pretty nice. I like the RGB colors. The software doesn't work with M1 Mac, but I was able to change the color with openRGB. I would definitely buy another one.Only knock is it feels kinda plasticky, cheap, but it's to be expected for the price range. It fits my purpose however, I am a happy customer.

    I bought this keyboard and used it for a few months. Here are my thoughts. While the keyboard feels very nice at first, membrane switches tend to wear over time, causing the quality to worsen over a few months noticeably. The same can be said for the keycaps, made of cheap plastic, causing them to absorb finger grease over time. While I was impressed with it at first, I replaced it over the course of a few months. Instead, I would recommend getting a mechanical keyboard. Those tend to last much longer. (I upgraded to the Keychron v3, which I am now satisfied with.)Pros:-Great RGB, customizable with software-Quiet switches-Looks coolCons:-Switches and keycaps wear out quickly, causing the quality to worsen-Doesn't last!Verdict:7/10For the price, you get what you pay for. It gets the job done.

    As many before me, I crashed my great lighted KB which I had loved for 4 or 5 years. It was always doing great till one day it died! There are many things in reference to computers that can be hair-pulling, but loss of the KB ranks right up there, especially if you have no replacement to grab! I didn't, and I hate the virtual KB available in Windows.I am not a gamer, just a slow typist and need those lighted keys! OK, here is my likes: 1) The absolutely stunning lighted base and each lighted key! Great night light to find my way to the head in the middle of the night! 2) The keys are over-sized a bit (shaky fingers) and the letters are large and exceptionally  legible. 3) Tactile feedback reminds me of the old IBM clickable keys, which I really loved, not being a touch-typist.I purchased this one in May of '22 and was so happy using it that I purchased a second as a spare, as I damn sure don't want to have to use the virtual KB again!This KB feels like it is well-made and with the revolving (brightness adjustable) colors is kinda' neat. Oh, I am 76 years old and I've not played a lot of games. The only ones I recall are Star Trek (with asterisks launched) to shoot down Klingons, Mission Command, and those great text-based D&D-type text adventurer games, so this one is great for what I need!Hopefully my Apex 3 TKL RGB KB and I  can last beyond 80, but if one of us doesn't, I'll have a spare for my kids (53 & 46)!Thanks to  the manufacturer for a fine product!Alan Arnold

    As soon as I plugged this keyboard into my IMac M1 2021 desktop computer, a message showed on screen that it did not recognize the keyboard and all I had to do was do two things when it asked me to. Sync shift to the UP arrow under the caps lock arrow on this Keyboard and the ctrl key as well if I am remembering correctly. Typing has that old school keyboard sound and the lights are bright but in a satisfying way. Amazing work around low price keyboard for mac. I would recommend this to many!

    Pros:- The RGB is very nice and bright- Can customize the RGB to an extent using the Steelseries GG software- The additional wheel and button on the keyboard are both very useful, sadly I chose to look for a smaller keyboard and life has become Win+A.- Turn on the Air Conditioner and put on your headset (mine doesn't have ANC) and you will not hear the keys, but you surely will feel them well enough.Cons:- The RGB is not per key, this limits the customizability of the keyboard.- Is 50% louder in the morning.- Is wired (Yes, I'm that kind of person)Opinion:I live in NYC, there is no space for wires, buy it if you don't mind wires and don't care too much about customizability of RGB. I think it's worth the price.

    The first keyboard I received the ""Q"" key didn't work.  I returned it, ordered a new one the second keyboard worked.The numbers are on top of the special keys.  They work the way the should. But, 2 is on top and @ is on the bottom of the printed key.  However shift 2 gives you the @ symbol. Since I'm a touch typest, I didn't notice this for several days.My biggest complaint is that there isn't a keylock indicator. Trying to log in, entering the password, web sights kept saying I had the wrong password.  OK, the keylock was on:-(

    I LOVED everything about this keyboard. Feel, sound, size, shape, look, except.. having to keep the software installed for anything other than cascading rainbow lighting. You can change it, with the software, easily. Don't start the software, back to default cascading. It just needs one static, non-rainbow default color scheme out of the box.Ultimately, I returned it for something almost identical but with persistent memory of color settings without the software running.

    I love using this with my media PC. I know it's not wireless but try gaming on a large LG OLED with a unlit wireless keyboard. Get a USB extension cord if you need. The keyboard is great in your lap or on the arm of your recliner. I use wireless mouse and this. I started gaming in the 90s so at 64 I appreciate a easy to read durable smaller line-up keyboard.

    Small and soft. I hate the number pad so I like this. Glows in the dark. Immediately. Automatically. Good price. Love it so far day one. Only thing I will say is - it's difficult to figure out how to screenshot. I still don't know how to screenshot right now. Regardless I will still give it a 5 star rating. I would give it a 4.9 review if I could. But I won't because that makes me sound like a salty boomer. Heh.

    This keyboard works great. I wanted a quiet keyboard with decent tactile feedback for gaming at night. I expected WAY less than this and figured id only use it when I don't want to anger the wife. Turns out that it feels good enough to use full time. I was also interested in the waterproofing because my damn cats always knock cups over.I will say that using a mechanical keyboard is better for typing if used *properly*. But let me tell you, 99/100 of you use them incorrectly to type and 100% of you use them incorrectly to game on. The entire benefit of a mechanical keyboard is that the actuation happens on a partial press where you do not need to bottom out the key....but I have NEVER seen someone gaming not bottom out the keys when spamming. Ever. All my friends, all streamers, everyone uses them like a typical membrane keyboard and just full sends every press. SLAM SLAM SLAM. So you may as well just use this keyboard and make 1/4 the noise at 1/4 the price and slamming these feels very similar to slamming a brown switch.If you are actually aware of how to use a mechanical keyboard for typing 120+ wpm and type a lot then it would probably be a good idea to keep one around. But I am a very picky typist and can peak at about 145 wpm and have no issues.Waterproofness - Id call it water resistant...even their website kinda hints at this. I had a cat knock over black coffee on it so I thought id test out the waterproof claims and took it to the sink and just blasted the entire thing with the shower head setting on the sink with the keycaps still on it. I really gave it the business. I shook it as dry as I could, dried it with a towel and it still works but now one of the led zones colors don't match up anymore. Keys still work fine though. So it will protect against spills but I wouldn't toss it into the dishwasher.

    Pros: My favorite keyboard for a clicky feel without the bone-jarring clack of a true mechanical keyboard. I prefer the TKL version because my right hand doesn't have to travel as far to reach the mouse. Cons: Have to install the branded software to change the backlighting. If you are happy with slowly changing rainbow backlighting, the software is not necessary, but I find the changing light distracting. So in order to get constant backlighting I tolerate the software, which seems to exist mostly to advertise the company's other products. Now and then the keyboard loses its backlighting settings and reverts to the default changing pattern, so I have to restart the software and set the backlighting again. But I love the keyboard so much that it's worth this annoyance.

    Bought this originally to replace a longer 10-key keyboard. It is awesome! The RGB effects are really cool and easy to switch, and the keys are loud and clacky like other 10-keyless mechanical keyboards out there. The keys feel smooth and easy to press. Love this keyboard, would highly recommend.

    One of the top featured reviews has many false claims about this keyboard, some drawbacks for sure but it has very good value for the price:- The software SteelSeries GG is required for changing RGB colors and key layout, but you are NOT required to create an account. Just hit skip when opening the software up for the first time and go to Engine to change settings.- The software is REQUIRED to run in the background for your settings to stick. It won't close out completely until you right click the taskbar icon -> Exit. It won't take up much resource so I wouldn't worry much.- There are macro key numbers labeled (M1-M6) but you cannot assign macro functions to an existing key without it losing its original value (For example, if you assign a macro to the DEL key, it won't delete anymore even if the SteelSeries key held down or not).- Dedicated SteelSeries Function key can only be used to change light mode and increase/decrease keyboard brightness level.- Keys are very quiet and decently tactile. You definitely won't type as fast compared to a mechanical keyboard but this is good for office work and gaming. - Build quality is very nice for the price, it is (I believe) plastic but very sturdy and high quality while not being too heavy.

    I didn’t want to spend a lot on a keyboard. I usually replace them every few years. I went with steel-series because I have some of their products (Arctis 7 headset, mousepad) and they are all high quality. To no surprise this keyboard is also high quality. You won’t be disappointed.

    Not that quiet, just typical membrane with keys that don't wobble for less noise. Software is required for lighting if you don't want it just color shifting all day which is ugly.Why can't I pick preset colors without the bloated software? My merc stealth from 15 years ago did it with, no software.Keyboard is well built, feels sturdy. Next one will not be a steelseries unless I can pick the lighting color (within reason) without software.

    I prefer my cheap keyboard that I gave to my girlfriend.  I got this thinking it would be quiet, capable of a solid red display and had a volume knob.  It is smooth for typing.  Quieter than my previous keyboard, not as quiet as I had hoped.  I like the volume knob.  My primary requirement was a keyboard I could set to all red so I can get to sleep at night.  My last keyboard managed this manually on the keyboard without special software, and never forgot to stay red.  This keyboard required an app that runs in the background demanding attention and updates.  Even with the app running, the keyboard forgets my instruction and only preference setting for all red, and goes all color changing all night.  The keyboard once set, should not require further instruction.  My cheaper keyboard followed my instructions.  I'll probably throw this one out.

    First of all Its a membrane not mechanical (i bought it by mistake) but it have a good feel to every keystroke like a dell US SK-8115 - NM467 (that keyboard has an amazing feel but this steel series is way better) , second i has a multimedia multi funtion button with a scroll for volume and mute. I like the fact that i can type for hours with not having any disconfort. I have month using it and still love even tho i cant play osu and apex to a good level with it because is not perfect for fast and precise key pressed like circle streams in osu and technical maps or super glide in apex and movement techniques (you can do it but will not always work as you want or need). I must say its actually a good keyboard overall and call it again its membrane with good feel. if you can buy the mechanical version i think i can do the trick.

    This seemed like a good choice as an illuminated keyboard for astronomy at night. Can't find anything to gripe about concerning the hardware, but REALLY... a 300MB download just so I can change colors? What's worse, the software is full of gaming BS and you need yet another account to actually set anything up, or just live with the rainbow lighting wave if you don't. At least the default out-of-the box could be something less distracting.  It took me an hour of fiddling around with the software to figure out how to get a nice subdued red color because the manual is worthless. It provides a little bit of info that becomes obvious 5 minutes after opening the box. However, it does see fit to translate everything into many other languages! Likewise, the website's ""help"" is just a bunch of Q&A. C'mon Steel Series...you should have considered this product would be used by someone other than a gamer and provide enough info to help someone set up the software. Or is there some obscure key combination that renders your bloatware unnecessary? You almost got this keyboard back.

    my normal keyboard is a g pro tkl, though i decided to try this one out as the g pro is very clicky and noisy. i love how quiet and smooth the typing experience is, and it plays great in games. there is something that puts me off of this keyboard, and that's the fact that the caps lock indicator is obscured by the macro keys. i would suggest moving the light indicator an inch or so higher so the user can see if caps lock is on without having to lean over their keyboard all the time

    i love this keyboard, it small and better then the apex 100 i have but one of the biggest problems i have with it is that it dose not have a polling rate, i really need to polling rate on this keyboard because i want to change it to 500hz or 1000hz and the reason being is because i play on a laptop and the more hz you have the better response time but at the cost of your cpu and i don’t have a good laptop so i really want steelseries to put a polling rate if they and or tell me how many polling rate it has to know what i’m working with. Otherwise this is probably the best budget keyboard every and even the apex100 is a really good budget keyboard but only thing i don’t like about it is that i can’t change the rgd but it has a polling rate which i did change a lot. so steelseries if you ever see this can you please tell me how many hz it has or if there ever going to be a polling rate for this.

    I got this keyboard to replace my RedDragon K552 keyboard that started to have different keys failing after a year.  This keyboard has a soft quiet key unlike a Razor or Roccat.  People used to tell me to mute on a conference call because they can hear me typing.  With this keyboard, I did not get that when I was un-mute.  I decide to give this to my son for his gaming as this is a shorter keyboard thereby giving him more space for his mouse.Pros:- Smaller Keyboard if you have limited desktop space (TKL)- Very quiet keys- Decent gaming keyboard (Will have to see as time goes)- Reasonable priced.Cons:- Key cap feels too plastic for me- Keystrokes too quiet for meI did not use for gaming so cannot comment on the application to control the keyboard.

    The Apex 3 TKL is a decent functioning membrane keyboard that is RGB backlit. The software was easy to download, install and get the backlighting working. When the computer goes to sleep, or is turned off, and then turned back on, the software doesn't resend the lighting command, leaving a working keyboard without any backlighting that is not easy to see the keys. I have had to open the software and  change the lighting zone color to get the backlight to work again, but for that zone. After repeating for each zone, I finally have a lit keyboard again. My corsair 60% keyboard lights back up without trouble when pressing a key to come out of sleep mode or when I reboot of the computer. The Steel Series engine software lets what should be a decent entry level TKL keyboard down.

    We have several wall outlets with integrated USB ports, but now that the USB-C plugs are becoming more widespread, our outlets are starting to become obsolete. These adapters are perfect. They aren’t bulky so we can leave them plugged into the outlet when we aren’t using them to charge a device, but sill be able to plug in a regular 110V appliance into the outlet without the adapter getting in the way. They also work well in the USB port of our laptops or in our current device charging bricks. The male USB side fits tightly into the port, so it definitely won’t fall out easily, and usually requires some wiggling it back and forth to remove it. I’m guessing it will loosen a little over time. This was a very convenient, and much less expensive, option than replacing our wall outlets or buying all new charging bricks.

    When updating my iphone to a 15, I found myself with many USB ports that would not accommodate the C cable. These adaptors worked out great. The quality seems to be good and they function as they should.

    It’s amazing how many cables are now usb-c by default and no adapters provided for the former standard of usb-a. This adapter was a welcomed addition to my tool kit. Works great, solid build and although a small drop in transfer speeds, it’s nothing really noticeable to the average user. I love the no branding on the final product, but again a great build and consistent performance for my day to day tasks.  I would recommend this adapter to others that are not ready to get rid of their older devices, and you get four in the package so, great backups or alternative adapters for multiple cables.

    I remember that cartoon and the movies they came out with when back in 1983 is when they first made that Inspector Gadget cartoon and all the Gadgets he was popping out of his head lol.We need all kind of Adapters and it will make you feel like your Inspector Gadget saying ""Go-Go Gadget Adapter!

I went looking for Displayport Male to HDMI Female Adapters and Mini HDMI Male to HDMI Female Adapters and USB-A Female to USB-C male Adapters, DVI Male to HDMI Female Adapter and DVI Female to HDMI Male.

    I use these adapters quite regularly and keep them accessible at all times.  I have an environment of mixed ports on various devices, and having these adapters lets me use what I need , when I need, quite easily.  I am now able to use some older USB 3.0 external drives with my Mac's USB-C port with a simple adapter and it gives new life to some older drives that I would otherwise not be able to use.

    I got a new iPhone 15 Pro which uses the new USB-C connector. My cars, however, only has the regular USB connectors. I tried using various cables in the house, but they only worked for charging the phone.

    They work excellent in permanent plugs such as the ones built in some automobiles like mine. You plug one in the previous area and connect your new cord. No need for an actual electrical plug in. Also had to be used for the control holder (adjustable bed) on my nightstand. The plug could not be changed so the small adapter did the trick. Highly recommend these.

    While I like the unified USB c port. What I don’t like is that USB c chargers only come with 1-2 ports because they can’t assume you won’t try to plug in a laptop or tablet. But since I have a lot of USB devices (camera stuff, battery banks, electronics) I don’t really need the fast charging for these. So I’m happy to keep using my old 4-6 port USB A chargers as I transition to more and more USB c devices

    Seems like a good product but I didn't think about one thing before I bought it. I plugged it into my monitor so that I could move my USB C headset between PCs on different floors of my house. Then I changed my mind about which USB A port I wanted to use. It took me 4 attempts over a 5-minute period to pull it back out!  There's no ""landing spot"" for fingers to grab it once it's inserted. Eventually, I used a jeweler's screwdriver VERY carefully to get enough leverage. Don't make my mistake -- plan ahead!

    I just got a new iPad. In typical Apple fashion, it uses a different connection from my old version for charging. Luckily it came with a new USB-C cord and transformer - but that only accounts for 1 place I will be using my device. I didn't know these adapters even existed. What a great solution! I would recommend these for charging, only. I have no way of knowing if they will impede the transfer of data, so I will only use the Apple cable for that.

I have several such devices - music boxes, star projectors, night lights, etc, etc, that just would not connect to my 'smart' power blocks.These power blocks worked perfect, everybody was happy at a reasonable price point. Nice Job.

    They are slightly bulky and you can't plug anything in unless it's very slim into the other outlet, but they're convenient for everything that needs a block to charge these days. Work great!

    These seemed too inexpensive to do the job, but they are great. I have a couple of electrical strips with a few USB outlets, but there's never enough. I bought a cute St. Patrick's Day light globe and it was batteries or a USB plug in. It sucked the batteries dry in 2 evenings, so I bought these to use. They're perfect!

    These are always a great buy because we lose them so often. They work just as good as the ones you pay big money for in the Apple Store, just at a much better price. Buy these instead of the more expensive ones! Especially if you have two teens that constantly lose them.

    Both usb A ports will charge at 2.1 (or 2.4?) amps at the same time.  In buying multi port chrgers you need to be careful that the charging rate doesn't default to 1 amp iff another port is in use.

    I've get so much more exercise, studying, and phone conversations done with these headphones!These are great bone conduction headphones! They have excellent battery life and there's an audible voice (English) that will tell you how much battery power is left in the headphones when they're turned on. I've only run out maybe once. That being said, these headphones don't actually cover your ear, so they work best in environments with low to medium noise. Sometimes that can be plus when you need to pay attention to your surroundings (for example at night). As long you understand where they work well, they're awesome!Use Case 1: Exercise - These are excellent because they're clean, nothing to stick in your ear and can be cleaned with a little bit of hand soap and water. While exercising, these are great for podcasts and motivational music. I use these in the gym and outside. Only issues are when I'm next to a road and there's a loud truck or group of motorcycles riding by.Use Case 2: Studying - These work best in quiet coffee shops or libraries with light conversation in the background. I usually put on some non-vocal electronic. These won't block out the sound of a TV, so I've found I needed different headphones to avoid those distractions.Use Case 3: Phone Calls - Great for phone calls in light to medium noise environments. They work well in a home or quiet office. I usually have these on and go for a walk outside.Tips: I bought the Hermitshell case for this and some of the longer after market charging cables.Background: I bought the standard after using the sizing guide on the manufacturer's website. I've never installed the app for the firmware update, so I'm using it with the original as-shipped software.10-Month Update: Still worth every penny and Shokz Customer Service is awesome! Keep your serial Number handy for any replacements!After almost a year of *heavy* daily use, the battery power is still great (Slightly, but still around 80% of original functionality which is great!)Also, the power button starting getting sticky and it became difficult to turn on and off. Thankfully Shokz has a two-year warranty. I had to go to Shokz website to submit my proof of purchase (easy to get from Amazon) and the product serial number. I didn't the original documents, so I had to use the macro function on my iPhone to zoom into the charging port to grab the serial number (after having to clean it with alcohol and qtips). So keep your serial number handy if you need to make a claim! The new ones arrived right away and work great!

    i bought and owned a pair of SHOKZ OpenComm  they were  amazingly  comfortable and awsome with great noise canceling mic i couldnt have been more happy with them till  i wasn't  the mic quite! They were still under warranty,  company notified me 3 times that i would receive a replacement but 6months to a year and i still did not get a replacement!!  Picked up a cheap used bone induction for a while then needed another pair still no replacement from shokz! I was hesitant to order any thing from shokz again. Did research and chose another brand.  Mojowa,  great qulity, amazing bluetooth range, decent sound, ok mic but terible fit for me  they hurt!  no mater what i did i could not get them comfrtable, regretted ordering them!kept thinking of the comfort of my old shokz what else did they offer?  Still decided to stay away from the open com but relented and  order these SHOKZ OpenRun Pro! Amost didnt!! but glad i did!! i can wear them all l day  i even forget i have them on!!!!  full disclosure;  i use my shokz most for cell phone use driving and construction work,  music listening is secondary, for you earbud sound critics they probably will not match sony or bose  but the sound is vastly  improved from my first  open com and the best in all  the bone inductions i have had!(FYI  little note/trick with bone induction, if they are not loud eough for you, if  you are in a loud enviroment  use earplugs or sound proof ear muffs and they will be loud!! Sounds i know,  crazy but true!I do not like earbud or things in my ears  i also like being aware of my surroundings so bone induction is the only way to go for me!  With a great battery life and fast chargeing, unrivaled all day comfort, sound greatly improve and a good mic thease SHOKZ OpenRun Pro! for me, are by far the best overall most comfortable bone induction headset available!  i want to stay a shokz user forever  i hope the quality of these excedes my last pair  of shokz or at least the costomer service is more reliable!!  because for now, these SHOKZ OpenRun Pro are great!  Stay tuned!!

    I purchased a pair Aftershocks in 2019, after wasting money on all different types of Bluetooth headphones. I can't wear anything in my ear canal. I suffer from chronic infections and my right ear canal just won't hold an ear bud.  My 2019 pair is getting to the point of not holding a charge anymore. A charge will only last 3-4 hours now.So, I decided to upgrade to a new pair. The sound quality has definitely improved. The comfort is about the same, light weight and easy to wear all day. I often will sleep with them on while traveling to block out background noises in hotels. I also like that these came with a case, my last pair didn't. I really like the magnetic charging cable must easier to use than the micro-usb on my old pair. The charging cable is short so I did order a longer one. Although these seem a little pricey, they are well worth the cost. My last pair has latest over 4 years with no issues. Prior to them I was lucky to have a pair last 6 months. I really can't express how much I love these! No pain, no discomfort, decent sound quality and durability!

    I recently purchased the Shokz Pro headphones, and overall, I'm quite satisfied with their performance during my workouts. These headphones are incredibly light, making them comfortable to wear for extended periods without causing any discomfort or strain on my head.One of the standout features of the Shokz Pro headphones is their secure fit. They stay firmly in place, even during intense workouts involving a lot of movement and sweating. This is a significant advantage for those who engage in rigorous exercise routines.However, there are a couple of drawbacks that I noticed while using these headphones. Firstly, the ear cushions are a bit too soft for my liking. While they provide a comfortable fit, I found that they don't offer the same level of noise isolation that I expected. This can be problematic, especially when working out in noisy surroundings or crowded gyms.Additionally, I found the volume output of the Shokz Pro headphones to be a bit underwhelming. If you enjoy listening to your music at high volumes during workouts, these headphones might not meet your expectations. While the sound quality itself is decent, it lacks the necessary punch to overcome external noise distractions.For individuals who prioritize a loud and immersive audio experience during workouts, I would suggest considering alternative options that provide a similar lightweight design but with a more powerful sound output.On a positive note, I found the Shokz Pro headphones to be durable and well-built. I've been using them daily for an extended period, and they have held up nicely without any signs of wear and tear.In conclusion, the Shokz Pro headphones offer a lightweight and secure fit that is ideal for workouts. However, they do fall short in terms of volume output and noise isolation. If you prefer to really hear your music during workouts, especially in noisy surroundings, I would recommend exploring other options that provide a similar design but with a louder audio capability. Nonetheless, for those seeking a comfortable and reliable option, the Shokz Pro headphones are worth considering.

    I've tried many many bone conducting earphones since I use my headphones all day and in ear or over ear headphones causes a lot of heat/hearing issues in long term. So far I've never seen one that I can easily listen to and not broadcast what I'm listening to outside. All others were somewhat audible from outside. Low volume level, enough to disturb your partner night time or passenger next to you while travelling. This one is as perfect as you can ever get. This really sits on the bone, does not give out audio to outside (you can barely hear it if you remove it from your ear and hold it half an inch from your ear. And even during night time, it is inaudible to my partner. Sound quality is also somehow much better than others I've tried. I'm not gonna lie, I've tried all other options because I did not want to pay this absurd price for this one. But in the long run, with me changing headphones because I was not happy with them and some others just failing/breaking down, I've spent more than the price of this one. I still think it is way too expensive for what it is, but it is without competition I guess that's why the price can be so high and they still can sell this. I've bought it in the end after all, right?  So far, I could not be happier. Highly recommend it. So, as for negatives, first you really need to know that any bone conducting headphones will feel funny/tingly when you're listening to high volume music or high bass situations. So if you're listening to low frequency stuff like explosion scenes in a movie or music with high bass then you will feel a bit tingly if your volume is high. Second thing is battery life. 10 hours nowadays is too short of a runtime for headphones. My over the ear headphones can run literally days without being turned off at all, while it is still playing music. I used to not even bother to turn the music or my headphones off, I'd just leave them on my desk and come Monday, they will still be playing the music. Of course this is a tiny device with a tiny battery so 10 hours it is I guess. Just be prepared to charge it daily. Which leads us to: Third, proprietary  charging cable. That really is something that always bugs me. Why oh why would companies not use standard cables? I mean I know why, it is a business model to get more money out of you and it is easier to design a product like this if you don't have to worry about the depth of a USB C connector. But still, it is annoying. you have to carry around a special cable when you're travelling just for this one. The rest of my devices, laptops, external mobile screens, writing pad, my phone, my mouse they all are charged with usb c, so I can share the adapter and cable. But now I'll have to carry this cable too. And if I forget... well no music after 10 hours. These are all the negatives so positives outweigh by a large margin. In the end, I highly recommend these if you have any hearing issues caused by heat/moisture of keeping on headphones all day, if you have hearing loss due to eardrum or if you want to ride a bicycle while still being able to hear approaching traffic or if you just plain and simple have money to burn. The length of this review should show how much I liked these. Seriously though, try to switch to bone conducting headphones even if it is a cheaper one if you have the issues that I've mentioned. It makes your life much better and keeps your hearing and ears in better condition.

    These headphones are great, I can still hear my surroundings and it has some pretty cool base. I sometimes forget they are on my head that is how great they fit since they do not go in my ear they do not make my ear soar for wearing them for so long. They last me all day long and they charge so fast. I love these headphones. I do not see how these headphones can be noise canceling since they do not go in your ears.

    Finally a product that delivers on promises. This thing is very well designed and very easy to use. The microphones are great and sound quality is very good for normal conversations. Not for high fidelity listening hit fine of you are a runner or cyclist and sweat a lot. They stay secure to your head. Pleased in every way

    No matter how small they come, earbuds make my ears ache after wearing only a short time. I thought discomfort was the price I had to pay for personal listening. This headset by SHOKZ has truly changed my life.The first set I got was in an airport where there was only one size. I purchased them and immediately felt relief. They are not noise canceling which is no big deal for me. The only drawback was how far they stuck out behind my head. Still, they were far more comfortable than anything I had previously worn. I used them for months until…My sister-in-law showed me hers which were smaller and lucky for me they were on a back Friday sale!!These are so comfortable I no longer need to keep buying cheap sleep headphones that slide around on my small pinhead. I rarely wake up due to discomfort. They charge fast and are ready to go. Phone conversations are clear on both ends. Music and books sound great and yet I can still respond to what is happening around me. I won’t pretend these are the best choice for air travel but they work well enough for me.I have recommended both sizes to all my family and friends. Each that purchased have thanked me.

    First off, if you are looking for a high fidelity experience, these are not for you.  These do not sound as good as most in-ear earphones that I have used.  However, the experience is really not that bad.  I am not offended by the sound quality since I understand the limitations.  I have not had these too long, but I seem to think they are sounding better than the first time I used them or I might just be getting used to them and forgetting my old in-ear pair.  I am not sure, I just think they are totally fine for the purpose.For running these are very good.  They are lightweight and comfortable and the controls are easy to use.  Speaking of controls, I appreciate the actual buttons and not the sensor buttons I had in my previous set these replaced.  I hated having to perfectly tap to get something to happen while I was running.  I particularly hated getting a little sweat on the touch sensor and having my volume start ramping up until the point where I needed to yank them.  Tactile buttons are totally welcome.When being near a road, it can be challenging to hear them and I have needed to up the volume higher than I normally would like.  That is something to consider.  From my research, bone conduction headphones can impact hearing over time if too loud.  It just impacts a different part.  However, that is part of why I like these.  Situational awareness.  The other day I was running on some trails and a person on a bike said something and I was able to move over.  I would not have heard what he said with my old in-ear set.Overall, I am giving these 2 thumbs up for the time being.  I will update this review in the event my opinion changes.  I would have loved to wait until the OpenSwim Pro is released, but unfortunately I needed a new set of earphones sooner.

    Update 03/02/2024 - Although it was disappointing the battery in my unit gave out I'll have to say the warranty process was executed with precision by Shokz.  Shokz responded within the stated time and took care of all my concerns.  In a word their performance was flawless.  Back to 5 stars.  Original review follows.Yes these have a 2 year warranty.  With this in mind.....I bought these to use while cycling so I can be aware of my surroundings.  For that purpose these are great because they do NOT block your ear canal at all.  On top of that they're comfortable.  A tradeoff is the sound quality isn't going to be up to par with a high end earbud that blocks off your ear canal.  I have 2 sets of earbuds because when I don't need to be aware of my surroundings I prefer a traditional high end set that focuses on noise reduction and sound quality.Like I said in the title I bought these less than a year ago and the battery is pretty much toast.  This set use to operate for hours and now will barely make it through a 75 minute workout.  What a pain in the rear end to almost be through my ride and hear the dreaded low battery message.  Used to be I'd get about 3 of those messages before it shut down.  Now I get 1 and it immediately shuts down.Shokz used to require registration to file a warranty claim but now says you don't need to.  All you have to do is fill out a warranty claim form.  To do this you'll need the serial of your device (on these it is wrapped around the charge port and you'll need a magnifying glass - if you still have the box that's a much easier place to get it), and a dated sales receipt.  Once submitted you need to wait for Shokz's response (they claim within 2 business days) - they may or may not require you to send in your set.  My understanding is there will be no fee even if I have to return these - but if there is these will go in the trash and I'll move on to Bose Ultra's.The main reason for my 3 star review here is I expect to be able to use something like this for years before failure - and here I am at 7 months dealing with a warranty claim.  What a PITA.

    I do love these. But there are some pros and cons:Pros:*Not in my ear. That's a major pro. A big one.*Sound quality is good. I'm not a huge music buff. I just like to listen to classical while I work.*Comfortable. They barely bother me after a few hours.*Discrete. They aren't very visible*They work even w my long hair. I put them under my hair in the back.*Battery life is decent. Lasts me a couple days at work. I don't use them all day long.*You don't have to take them off to hear people or talk to people, though I usually still pause whatever is playing as it can still be distracting*They work decent for phone calls. My dad said they sounded really really clear. I was pleased as I didn't expect a mic. They worked better for phone calls than for watching movies. The audio wasn't bad for a call.*They connect really easily to my iphone 12. My son had trouble getting his to connect and stay recognized with his laptop and his iphone 6s, but I have had no problems.*Charger connects easily because it's magnetic. They charge fast and that's using my PC USB port.*The case is slim. This is a big plus. They're also flexible and they don't seem like they would be easy to break, even without a case.Cons:*They are not noise cancelling AT ALL. I know this is a feature not a flaw, but you cannot hear the music at all if anything else is going on around you. I switch to my Raycon earbuds if there's external noise.*Not good for TV/Movies. I can't understand/hear dialog on these even though they work great for music. It's too quiet even on the loudest settings. I use my Raycons for dialog podcasts or shows. But they make my ears sweat and itch. I do prefer the comfort of these. These seem to work pretty well for phone calls though, so I'm not sure why the inconsistency. Even when it's quite around me I cannot hear a movie regardless of what platform I try them on.*They are MOSTLY comfortable. They do put some uncomfortable pressure on my ear tops over time, but that's hours. Also you can't really lean back in a chair or on a pillow with these as they don't sit flush on your neck. I got my son the regular and the mini for myself and he ended up getting minis too even though he has a huge head.*They do buzz a bit and it can tickle. I don't listen to high base. Mostly I use it for classical music to try to destress while I work. I don't find the buzz bad*The charger is proprietary  so don't lose the cord. And you have to bring the cord with. Not a problem for me as I only keep them at work.*When the battery starts to get low it constantly says ""charge me"" which I find annoying. Just say it once or twice and let them die. Don't repeat it every few minutes until it dies, which can be a good 20-30 mins after you get the warning.*It's not really a con, but these come with a headband. I couldn't figure out how it was supposed to be incorporated and turns out it's simply a headband. It doesn't wrap around them or anything. I think it's so that if you have long hair you can keep it back from under the conductive plates as they don't work well if there's anything keeping them from making contact with your skin. But I was confused until I googled what it was for.No idea how they work for sport or exercise because I'm fat and I don't run. But they seem pretty secure on my head.

    This product admittedly has a lot of cons, but the pros outweigh them easily. I will start with the cons first. The sound quality is subpar, the highest volume setting is not only underwhelming, but it actually shakes the whole earphone and you can feel the vibration around your ears. The person standing next to you can also hear whatever you are listening to if you have it turned up high enough.With all of this being said, this is by far the most comfortable headset you can buy. Yes, I prefer wearing these over any earphone by a mile, and even more than your most expensive, premium, cushy headphones. Why? Because after wearing these for a while, you actually forget these are even there. You can even lie down wearing them and they won't crush your ears if you lay on your side. This is the only headset I can wear for hours without my ears or head starting to hurt.They are also very secure, I have never had them fall off my head or even get close to it while at the gym. The fact they do not cover or enter your ear canal means you do not even need a transparency mode; you can easily hear everything around you.So who is this headset for? Well, if you are an audiophile who needs to isolate from their surroundings, then this is probably not for you. As for everyone else, especially athletes, this is perfect.

    I'm a heavy equipment mechanic/welder. I wear ear plugs all day every day. I have tried all other noise cancelling headphones on the market that can fit under a welding hood and PAPR. These work amazing. The music is actually clearer with hearing protection earplugs in. You can carry on a conversation with music playing in the background. We do a lot of carbon arc gouging and you can clearly hear the music while gouging. They take a few minutes to get used to because there is a slight vibration felt in your head. Another wider I work with who is elderly and wears hearing aids uses them. He says he can hear music like he's in his 20's again without hearing aids. They wrap around your ear and contact the skull behind your ear and by your side burn in the other contact point. I wear them with safety glasses and FR head sock with no issues. I can even carry on with a phone call under my welding hood while working and the person on the other ends never complains about background noise. They do get in the way with some head protection that uses a chin strap or has adjustable suspension that contacts the base of your skull. The only downside is the charging connection is magnetic and attracts grinding dust and metal shavings. Not the end of the world, just blow them off with compressed air. The battery lasts about 14 hours of music played all day. They charge in less than an hour. The pause/call button on the side is easily operated with heavy gloves on. You can walk about 200 feet away from your phone before they disconnect.

    It took a little getting used to the sound difference between these OpenRun Pros and my over-the-ear Bose QC35 headphones, but knowing the Pros wouldn't compare to the Bose, my expectations weren't all that high. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality. No, you're not gonna get that booming bass, but that's not what they're designed to do.It only took an hour or so to charge them up  and I expect to get more battery life than other similar phones. The app was very user-friendly. You can switch EQ settings between standard and vocal. The BEST part is how well they stay where they're supposed to stay. The band in the back is flush with the back of my neck. I have a HUGE (watermelon) head and they fit great...so much so that I can lay my head on a pillow and they stay on. My Samsung Buds2 Pro always fell out - even while just sitting or slowly walking. Frustrating! Again, not so with these OpenRun Pros.CAVEAT: It takes a bit getting used to repeat songs. The multi-function button does NOT protrude which makes it difficult sometimes to locate and then press 3 clicks for the repeat function to work. I'm sure with a bit more practice, I'll get it down (I just got them 2 days ago).All in all, I'm extremely pleased with this purchase. Go for it!

    Don’t expect them to cancel noise! THEY ARE MEANT FOR YOU TO LISTEN TO MUSIC AND STILL FOCUS ON YOUR SURROUNDINGS! THEY'RE AMAZING!!!!!!! Only 1 compliant.. sometimes when you go to charge the headphones it’ll indicate that they’re charging, but when you go to turn them on after they’re fully charged, the indicator will say “charge me” even when they’re clearly not connected to the Bluetooth, or turned on, they’ll still need to be “charged”. Just plug The headphones back in for 30min and they’ll be fully charged! Other then that they are SUPER COMFORTABLE! LONG BATERY! When purchasing the headphones it does say they last 10 hrs but really it’s more like 11&half to 12 hrs. Like the battery life is AMAZING!! And very COMFORTABLE!

    This one particular product came broken. However was returned without an issue. I have had this particular brand and use it every day all day. 15 minutes to charge fully, and talk on it for over a day. Super quality product. I've used it in the shower and had one on when the canoe tipped over... Completely submerged worked just fine for the rest of the day Even. I would buy this immediately if I lost another pair. I want two just for the purpose, and just to make sure I have one when it's charging. Sounds crisp, sharp and clear. Great base. Nose cancellation is high quality. It is difficult for your called party to hear you if it is a windy day though, but easily worked around.

    I’m a new runner and training for my first half marathon.  Music is my motivator so I need it to run.  I’ve tried a couple different ear buds and none of them stay in my ears.  Constantly jamming an ear bud in my ear while running was getting old.  I saw these and wanted to order them but was hesitant after reading a couple reviews about the charger and sound quality.  After talking to a couple people who absolutely love theirs, I finally decided to order.  When they came, I charged them and it was completely fine.  The magnet snapped right on and charged to 100% so I’m unsure the issue others were having with the charger.  I tried them out on an 8-mile training run and they worked beautifully.  They didn’t move, the sound quality was great, and I wish I had ordered sooner.  Of course they don’t have much bass but I’m ok with that as I don’t need bass while I’m running.  I could still somewhat hear what others were saying when I had them on, which is good because I like to stay aware of my surroundings on runs.

    I gather that these sound noticeably better than other bone conduction headphones, but those must be worse than mediocre given what I hear with these.  3 stars for mediocre sound, quirky controls, and not great value for the price (~$180 when I bought them, though they are less expensive as of this writing).  On multiple scores for this premium-priced model, I'm afraid Shokz over-promises and under-delivers.  Details follow.USE CASE (background info, skip ahead to SOUND QUALITY for product comments):  My use case for this was a little unusual - I wanted to listen to music from my phone in a car that lacked Bluetooth or aux-in.  Headphones seemed unsafe, FM xmitter not a reliable option due to lack of open freqs in my area, and upgrading w/an aftermarket stereo isn't worth it for a 10-yr old car that I plan to sell on fairly soon.  I thought bone conduction might be a good solution since it wouldn't block my hearing for traffic sounds, alarms, etc.  I read that sound quality wasn't the main strength of these athletic-oriented headphones, so figured I'd splurge and get the OpenRun Pro since it's consistently rated among the best in this category for sound quality (and I was avoiding the cost of a new car stereo after all).SOUND QUALITY:  First things first - to my ear the sound quality is perfectly fine for spoken word (audiobooks, podcasts, etc.) but not at all satisfying for music, lacking both bass and high end.  In one sense I'm glad I got these because anything with lower quality would be unacceptable for music and I'm not seeing any models consistently rated higher for sound; on the other hand, judged solely for spoken word, perhaps a less pricey option might have sufficed.  I think these are probably the worst sounding speakers or headphones on which I even try to listen to music (e.g., the affordable little Photive Hydra waterproof BT speaker I keep in my bathroom is much more pleasing).  I've also used these for a few phone calls and they sound great for that.  Folks on the other end seem perfectly happy with mic sound.ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:  Shortly after buying this Shokz I got the Oraolo M110 wearable (around the neck) BT speaker, and it worked far better as a  car audio solution than the Shokz, mainly due to superior sound quality (while still leaving ears open to hear the surroundings), for about a third of the cost (though in fairness it eventually had other issues).  If I'd thought to check that out first I'd never have bought the Shokz and saved myself some money; the Oraolo may not hold a candle to proper over-ear headphones, but its sound quality is head and shoulders above the OpenRun Pro.  The Oraolo had some quality problems with its switches that forced me to return it, but a holiday price cut on Sony's premium version of this tech (SRS-NS7) eventually got that to a price (little more than I'd paid for the OpenRun Pro, actually) that I could justify.  Anyway, because I use the neck speakers and the Shokz for similar purposes, I'll mention a few points of comparison in the following comments.UTILITY:  Despite the above, I do still use the OpenRun Pro with some frequency since I already have them.  They're great for listening to podcasts around the house without disturbing others or while driving, you barely notice you're wearing them (if I've paused the sound to deal with an interruption that goes on longer than expected I can completely forget they're on) - on that score they beat anything else I've owned.  Being worn directly on the head the sound is unaffected by head movements (an issue for neck speakers).  They're not as quiet for folks around you as, e.g., in-ear or over-the-ear headphones, but they're not at all loud in that regard, MUCH quieter than, e.g., neck speakers.Battery life is usable (at least a few hours), but not nearly the 10 hours they claim.  They certainly don't last as long as other BT headphones and speakers I have, but all this may be understandable given their size and weight.FEATURES/FUNCTIONS:  Apart from sound quality, this is where I have the most gripes.  Controls are on both left and right sides, with a single multi-function button on the left speaker used for play/pause/answer (1 click), FF (2 clicks), and REW (3 clicks), and a rocker on the right temple controlling power and volume. The problem with this arrangement is that it's so hard to time the 3 clicks for the rewind/skip-back function that it's nearly useless, with the headphones often doing a FF &  pause instead (so of course then you have to REW further...); I usually give up after one try and use my phone or smartwatch.  This would all work much better with a rocker switch in the left temple like the one on the right to control FF/REW, leaving the main button on the left speaker dedicated to play/pause/answer.  Awful design as it stands.More randomly, the OpenRun Pro sometimes just shuts itself off with an alert tone while in the middle of playing (so not a silence time-out, which they also do) - this seems to happen most often when using it with Roku remote listening, which can be inconvenient.  It does power right back up when you hit the right temple rocker switch .  I've noticed that this issue is addressed in the Shokz OpenRun troubleshooting guide with a recommendation to ""File a warranty claim"", but it doesn't happen all that often apart from the Roku app and recovery isn't that problematic.OVERALL:  There are some real advantages to this ultra-light non-isolating form factor and I see these are priced below $150 right now, but I'd shop around and check out some reviews for comparable models at lower prices, especially if you'll mainly be listening to podcasts or audiobooks.  For music, I really don't think any of these are likely to be much good given the current state of the art.

    These are my first pair of bone conducting earbuds, the sound is very good.  At full volume you can feel them vibrate by your ears.  They do leak sound at full blast which should be expected as they’re not in ear.  They also can be drowned out by excessively louder activities, like the pressure washing and engine noise I have at work.  The battery life for these is astonishing.  I have forgotten to charge them after a 10 hour work day and they’d lasted almost the whole second day, the fast charging also comes in handy in the event you forget to charge them.  Absolutely love these and will recommend them to friends and coworkers.

    Picked these up so that I would be able to hear the world around me on walks or around the house.  Sound quality is good and no issues when using them making phone calls.  Allows me to listen to podcasts/audiobooks without people noticing.  Music quality is good, though really notice the difference when switch over to over-the-ear headphones and you realize just how much bass is missing on these.  They can start to feel a little tiresome when over the ears for an extended time, but they slip down and around the neck easily, and can just slide them back on if receiving a call.  Very happy with these as they gave me all the things I was looking for.

    I don't review a lot of products, but I needed to share an experience. I bought these Open Run Pro's  a while ago and have really enjoyed them. The sound quality is good and they have stood up to my sweaty head. I wear them every day.  Recently the mic went out on them and I made a warranty request with Shokz even though I didn't expect much. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a new set several days later. I hadn't even seen the emails due to my email dropping them into a different folder. This was great customer Service despite my lax email response.

    Like the fact I no longer suffer from ear fatigue from pressure of buds in my ear. I operate a forklift and I can safely wear these while I’m working. You can hear conversations around you. You can hear all safety alerts or warnings. I’m really please With quality of sound. I will probably ever get another pair of in ear Buds. I can use Bluetooth connectivity with my phone, it’s a perfect fit for work. Great when I’m in the office or in hallways.

    I had to replace my beloved Aftershokz Airs after a sudden death that I was most unprepared for.*moment of silence*So I got the OpenRun Pros and they are fine replacements for the most part. What is disappointing is that the OpenRun Pros seem to be a little less enthusiastic about connecting to various devices via Bluetooth. The Airs were happy to bounce around from laptop to iPhone to portable speaker. In fact, they'd often get a little too enthusiastic and get frustrated if my iPhone and MacBook were both within range. The OpenRun Pros though...not so eager, and often when I do connect to my iPhone I have to fiddle around with things a bit to get the sound to actually come out of the headphones and not the phone itself.Beyond that I'm a big Shokz fan. For outdoor exercise like running there's nothing better or safer if you insist on wearing headphones. I have no trouble hearing approaching traffic or cyclists on the roads and trails. If you're an audiophile looking for awesome fidelity in your sound these won't do the job. What they will do, though, is provide clear and reliable sound for music, podcasts, audiobooks, phone calls, etc. while you're out there doing the work.

    I have several different styles of headsets. Most recently I went for the ear bud version from Samsung. But I didn't like wearing them for more than about 30 minutes. I gave these open run Shokz I try and I have absolutely no regrets. I did go for the smaller sized ones. I barely feel them on my head. And they work great in a room with low level noise. I couldn't recommend them for a room with a lot of ambient noise. But that's an okay compromise for me. There are other options if you need to be totally immersed in what you're listening to. But for everyday listening to audiobooks and music while working around the house, walking, etc. these are perfect!

    3 years ago I decided to try the open move by aftershokz headset, which was the cheapest version of this brand at the time. I fell in love with being able to wear these all day without having to remove and keep track of earbuds while I work.So when I finally broke my aftershokz, I debated between these and the beats powerbeats. I decided pretty quickly to go with these because I thought they would be an even better version of the aftershokz I already liked. This belief turned out to not be quite true.The good: these are more comfortable than my old ones and they have much better call quality. I always had problems with people hearing me on phone calls with my old pair, but these have no problem at all.The bad: The sound quality is worse than my old pair. Sound quality is never a strength with bone conducting technology, so I was disappointed to find out these were even worse than a cheaper pair from 3 years ago, but what was an even bigger disappointment was the battery life. My old pair was marketed as an 8 hour battery life while these are marketed as 10 hours, but these dont last nearly as long as my old pair. My estimation is that they die about 1-2 hours before my old pair. And pairing that with the fact that they have a proprietary charger make them even worse. My old pair would usually last the whole time I would be at work, and if they did die, it was a basic USBC charger. These have died all 3 days I have worn them to work, and I'm not carrying the charger because I don't want to loose it and have to order a new one.In conclusion, the battery life problem is too much of a deal breaker for me, so I am returning these and buying the beats. I would rather carry around a case for the earbuds and get better sound quality than have to take off and charge these in the middle of my work day.

    I have had my AfterShokz Trekz Air since early 2019 and have loved them and promoted them to everyone who asked or would listen. I only replaced them because the battery was not able to last all day any longer. The new model Shokz OpenRun Pro is nice, but the volume and therefore sound quality is not nearly as stron as the older model. I have not tried the new ones on a flight yet, but that was my favorite experience with the older models. I will try to remember to submit an update after my next trip.

    I live in a busy city so it is important to be constantly aware of my surroundings.  These make it so easy to go on long walks and runs throughout the busy city.  I feel so safe and secure with these on.  The battery life is so incredible and the fit is so comfortable.  I used to wear only one earbud or AirPod on at a time and I have totally stopped using it.  For everyone who walks or runs alone, these are so perfect to hear your surroundings

    I waited a year before giving a review. I also have never given anything on Amazon 5 stars, but I have for this. I work at a manufacturing facility. It's quite where I work (office) sound quality is fantastic (you get BASS!) but out on the floor I find music is it ,no podcats,unless you don't care about your hearing it will crank up. I will put them on in the morning and forget there even there physically,never has been an issue. 8-10 hours play time and still has plenty to go further. 30min tops for recharge for me. When I walk away from my phone it will automatically connect every time, so easy to use MONEY WELL SPENT!

    I'm really enjoying these headphones for their open design, allowing me to stay aware of my surroundings while walking on the street, which enhances both my enjoyment of music and my safety. However, my main gripe is with the proprietary charging cable. In an era where USB-C has become almost universal, the lack of it here feels like a missed opportunity for convenience. It's particularly inconvenient for travelers, as forgetting this specific cable can render the headphones unusable until you're back home. A switch to USB-C would make these headphones near perfect, combining great sound with the convenience of easy charging

    These headphones have been great. I have used them at the gym while weight training, and they stay on my head easily in the various different positions I get into. It has been useful to be able to have my ears open inn order to have a quick chat with someone (""are you using this?"" without taking out my headphones. On the flip side of this you do hear everything, so if your goal is to drown out your surroundings, this probably won't be your favorite. I think the sound is a bit of a compromise, but it is still surprisingly good. I have also use these as a backup to my work headset when my primary headset has run out of battery. People say they hear me wall and that the sound quality is good. My only CON is that I don't like that these headphones have a unique charger. It is yet one more thing I have to have. I would be much happier if it were a common plug, such as micro USB or USB-C. That being said, I don't have to charge it very often. The battery life is quite good!

    I do residential window cleaning, so I like to keep at least one ear open while working around customers' homes / my coworkers. I would normally rock the single earbud when on the job like most people, but when I saw these, I had to pick them up seeing the specific advantages. Now that they've been attached to my skull for close to 100 hours in the past month and a half, I figure it was time for a review.These were a no-brainer for me, given the hours of podcasts I tend to go through. To me it was worth the sacrificing sound depth in favor of having both ears open, yet being able to hear my audio in both ears. This is the first pair of headphones in general that has allowed me to have quick conversations without even hitting pause.Speaking of pause, I really appreciate the tactile pause / volume buttons. This was clearly a nod to the athletes they're marketed towards, and it's nice to not take off my gloves every time I need to pause, plus touch controls are useless in wet environments.I can't stress enough how comfortable these are. I had no clue how snug this type of ""bone conducting"" headphone would be on my skull, but they feel weightless. I wore these for 6 hours straight on a job, and they didn't bother me at all.Now for sound quality, the consensus among reviewers is pretty clear on these, and I would echo that. Don't even attempt electronic music. Heavier rock / metal is quite doable, you'll definitely get good vocals / mids, just know these do vibrate a lot with fuller sounding music and can feel a little odd especially at high volumes. You'll probably be pleased with anything acoustic. Podcasts / talk are the biggest win byfar with these.The case these come with is quite nice. I'm a little surprised they didn't find a way to put a battery into the case given the easily accessible magnetic contacts. It's not a deal breaker or anything, but the charging is proprietary, albeit ridiculously fast, but you are beholden to a single cable as your lifeline, so as long as you don't forget the cable for any long trips, running out of juice shouldn't be an issue. There have been days where I hastily plugged these in for 20 minutes before work after forgetting, and that was enough for them to go from ""battery low"" to ""battery high"" (those are just the voice prompts, I would guess it went from around 30% to 80%). Just hold on to that cable for dear life.Overall these headphones are well worth the money if you know what you're using them for.

    This is my fifth pair. First 3 pair, the skin covering didn't hold up on 2 pair. The 3rd pair the power button got stuck. The fourth pair the wire broke. They sound great and are very comfortable. They charge quickly. If I didn't like them, I would stop buying them because they are not cheap by no means. However, I wear them at least 8 hours a day, seven days a week. Earbuds fall out of my ears and you cannot hear what is going on around. These are also safe. I wouldn't recommend any other brand. I have bought others and they do not come close to Shokz sound, quality and safety.

    I've had several people ask me what I'm wearing. All I have to say is, ""Oh you gotta hear this."" And they are impressed.Great product.Very lightweight.Fits good over my glasses.Bluetooth connectivity/reconnect to my phone is really good.Good range - under 30ft through walls.Sound quality is better than I expected, except the bass (see note below). It's even better if I wear a sweat/head band down over my ears.Battery life is 8-10 hours for me, which is better than what I expected for the light weight.It's the little things...The proprietary charging cable/connector is short so I'll need to buy a longer oneThe vibration from the bass of some audio tickles my outer ear which is annoying and distracting, unless I wear a headband down over my ears.

    I had to order a second pair because one of the ear pieces broke off of the first pair. They seem to be fairly sturdy, so I suspect that there may have been a minor flaw or crack in the first pair. I work from home, so I wear these each day for meetings. I use MS Teams, and they work pretty good for that. They connect to my HP laptop through Bluetooth. I wish that the piece that connects the two ear pieces together was just a little longer. Right now the right ear piece puts too much pressure on the top front part of my ear and causes pain after several hours of use. Now for the good; The sound quality, both what I hear, and what others hear from me seems to be very good. I wear these from 8 to 10 hours each day, and the battery life is very good. It has been very rare that the battery has not lasted all day, and those times have been with very heavy use. The recharge time is very good, and if you need to get a little more use out of them you can do a quick 5 minute charge to get you through another meeting. I haven't timed how long it takes to get a full charge from almost empty but it seems to be about 40 to 60 minutes. I try to charge them up and them remove them from the charging cable so that they aren't charging all night. They have been left charging over night on a few occasions without a problem. So far, I have been very happy with them. I am thinking about moving up to the OpenComm UC version because my primary use for them is work meetings. The ability to mute with the button on the boom mic would be very helpful.

    I was an early adopter of the bone conductance headsets, tracing all the way to the original Aftershokz headset. While the company is reAirForce Talon SSnamed simply Shokz, the product has vastly improved.For voice-only applications, the sound quality is more than sufficient, both in terms of the microphone and the ""speakers."" This also applies to listening to audible books and podcasts.For music, however, one may find the bass a little lacking. With a tone generator, I can tell that a pure sine wave at 90 Hz is barely noticeable. This inspired me to use an equalizer to try to reproduce how music sounds like using a Hifiman Ananda driven by a humble Fosi DS1 amp. If I set the equalizer to start to roll off at 90 Hz (0 db) and down to -36 db at 36 Hz, then the audible experience is *about* the same.In reality, the OpenRun Pro does not sound quite as tinny because some lower frequencies can still be felt, but not heard. There is no easy way to configure the equalizer to quite reproduce this effect on a strictly air pressure wave headphone.If someone is expecting the same kind of sound quality as a normal headset in the same price range, there will be disappointment. If I want to really enjoy my music, the OpenRun Pro is definitely not my first choice. In a quiet room, the Hifiman Ananda + Fosi DS1 combo is hard to beat. In a noisy environment (vacuum cleaner, leaf blower, impact wrench, etc.), the Sony WF-1000XM4 with ANC or the Etymotic ER4XR are my choices.So when do I use the OpenRun Pro?When I just need some music ""in the background,"" especially when I am on the move. In a normal office, the OpenRun Pro sounds the best when it is at the medium level. Cranking up the volume seems to lose the balance between the high and low frequencies because the low frequencies are not as easy to reproduce/perceive. Some slow ambient music played through the OpenRun Pro really helps me get through a day of office work.Depending on the volume and genre of the music, I can carry on a conversation with my colleagues without pausing the music. Unlike the ambient mode of the Sony WF-1000XM4, there is no electronic pass through with distortion, conversations are just as natural as without wearing the OpenRun Pro.The OpenRun Pro is comfortable, too. I can wear it all day without feeling any discomfort. I also wear prescription glasses! As much as I enjoy the Ananda, WF-1000XM4 and the ER4XR, none of them is an all-day kind of headset (especially on a hot day). The battery life of the OpenRun Pro is superior, the battery level is still ""medium"" at the end of a long 12-hour work day (but I don't play music the entire 12 hours, although the headset is on all the time).Another benefit of the OpenRun Pro is that even when I am not listening to music, all the notification tones are played via the headset while I can hear everything in my surrounding. For example, in a meeting, I pause the music (some people speak very softly), but I leave the OpenRun Pro on. This way, I can get a calendar notification, but no one but myself hear it.

    So I tried a friends out and I liked them enough to order my own. However I wore mine for an extended period of time and they started to hurt the back side of my ears where the band touches. I tried to adjust them but they always went back to the spot of least resistance. Also when turned up the bass really tickles my temples, not a bad thing just funny. My last comment is the band that wraps behind my head is about 2 inches away from my head and I don't remember my friends fitting like that, I thought they were more snug. Maybe she had the mini?

    I work a week on week off 12 hour shift. It’s a operational job in a chair, and the ability to listen to audio books, podcasts, news, music all the while maintaining my hearing for the alarm sounds and radio conversation is a absolute must.These fit the bill so incredibly well, I loved them. The coworkers here started noticing and asking and they spread through our facility like an infection, now I’d say 7/10 guys here are wearing these. So many have them I never need to worry there’s a charger in every outlet lol,The only bummer was this Christmas 2023 my child borrowed them for a car ride to watch a movie on her present, and she lost them somewhere 2 hours from home, fell out of the truck I guess. I connected to them one last time via blue tooth (insane range) and then they disconnected so I think someone swiped them and left.I miss these headphones so much. Can’t really just go buy another pair for the price point right now.Audio is good. Heavy bass will vibrate and tickle your ears, Bluetooth connectivity is excellent you can walk away from your device and maintain the handshake, water resistance excellent, cleaning ability is easy, if you wear ear pro with these on they enhance the audio probably 125% better.Con is in a loud environment these become useless they can’t keep up with the noise and vibrations of a factory or anything, but if you put ear pro in they will, but if you do that you can’t hear anyone else so that’s a con.

    They're great for my daily walks on trails near my home. When I use regular ear buds I can't hear bicylists that yell to tell me when they're passing. The sound is great, but to me they're a little uncomfortable with glasses. The biggest downside for me is I can't use them for more than an hour or so. I have periodic migraines and the bone vibration seems to irritate my trimeginal nerve, which in turn triggers a migraine. If you have any facial neuralgia, this device is probaly not for you. It's an expensive thing to get only limited use from. I bought one for my husband as well. He loves his set and doesn't have any problem with it.

    The sound is amazing on these things, I can't really tell the difference between these and a speaker in the room and they even work with earplugs in. The only thing I did was get a silicone pad to glue to the inside of each speaker head. So it can grip my head properly.

    Yes, this Shokz product is more expensive but there is a noticeable improvement over cheaper items. These are not the same as earbuds or expensive over the ear headphones, however, for bone conduction headphones, these are amazing. Five stars for this category of headphones.

    I can't stop using my head set. I use it at work, to workout and my daily stuff. It's definitely helpful when you need to be hands free and need to make phone calls. The great thing about it is that I can hear what others tell me while listening to music.  I recommend this to everyone

    I wear these for working out and traveling for obvious safety reasons. I love being able to hear what’s going on around me while listening to music or a podcast. Only issue is they fit weird on my ears and wish they had an adjustment to better fit.

    These bone conducting headphones are great when you want to listen to something fairly loud without having people around you hear. They are also great when using them to talk with someone on the phone. They can hear you clearly and you can hear them clearly. Very comfortable to wear and easy to pause when someone comes to talk to you at work. A lot faster to pause than trying to pause on your phone. I headphones that go in my ears, they always hurt after a few minutes or fall out, so these are the perfect headphones for me. I would recommend these to anybody and everybody.

    I just bought an Apple Watch Series 8 45mm and I don’t want anything to scratch the screen. I was hesitant at first as i like the aesthetic of the watch and didn't want to ruin it or make it look bulky. It fits great, ads a little bulk but nothing too bad as you can see in my pics. Definitely worth it for the added protection, cost is reasonable as well as there are 2 in the package. Also the touch screen works just fine no issues at all, that was another worry of mine but so far it’s been responsive as far as the screen goes.

    Works great for my Apple Watch SE 2nd Generation! I got my watch about a week ago and almost immediately noticed how much I bump it into things while it’s on my wrist. So, I got this product for peace of mind. It feels very sturdy, is easy to put on, and looks amazing! It doesn’t feel or look bulky at all.The reason I did not give 5 stars - there is one downside in terms of functionality. I wish the case didn’t cover up the crown button so much. I have found it to be a little bit more difficult to scroll with the case on. Perhaps if the case were slimmer or the hole for the crown were bigger, it wouldn’t be an issue. Not a dealbreaker, but enough of an annoyance for it to be one of the first things I noticed when I put it on.Other than that small issue, I am satisfied with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone that owns an Apple Watch and wants a bit more protection than just a screen protector!

    I first bought these a couple of years back when I first bought my second Apple watch and now I can't imagine not having one on my watch. I got them for my parents and they like them too. I originally bought it because I didn't want my new watch getting beat up/scratched like my first watch did. While doing laundry I have bumped my watch so many times and this helps save it from scratching and getting beat up. I have replaced them a few times to try out different colors, and because after a while they get a little scratched. But hey I would much rather this get beat up / scratched than my actual watch. They are super durable and easy to put on which is nice. It's also fun because you can try different colors and it changes the color of the watch you have (but the screen part is still clear so you can see). Will repurchase again when needed.

    I found a pretty significant crack on the case today (I’ve had it for some time now) and I removed it when I got home fully expecting to see at least some damage to the watch itself. The watch was completely undamaged, just like new. I replaced the broken case with the second case included in the box. It keeps the watch safe and clean, is easy to remove at attach, doesn’t interfere with functionality, and doesn’t interfere with any watch bands. I couldn’t ask for a better case and I’ll definitely order another box to have on deck in case something happens.

    This save my new Apple Watch. My daughter shut the car door with my arm still there and it landed on the watch.  I was very upset to say the least because the screen was shattered.  One closer inspection, it was just the cover.  I was so relieved and very much believe in this product.

    I like the cover a lot and how easily it snaps on the watch. My only complaint is the moisture that gets in every time I wash my hands or handle something wet, you can see the bubbles on the edge of the watch screen. I pretty much have to take the cover off to dry off the moisture every time I get my hands wet, or take my watch off to avoid that from happening. Other than that it fits great and matches my watch nicely.

    I bounce back and forth between 'soft' and 'tempered glass' screen protectors for my Apple Watch.  When I install a soft cover, I remember how much I liked the instant response and gentle touch needed to get a response.  I also like how the tempered glass face a lot more scratch resistant and a lot easier to keep clean.  And how it's so much easier to just clean the watch and snap on the new cover when the old one gets damaged.The soft cases are less prone to relatively catastrophic impact damage, something that happens once in a while while I work on things.  The last tempered glass one has three cracks in it, plus scratches at the top and bottom.  The last soft one had dulling/fogging face syndrome, part due to use and exposure, some due to age.  They seem to last me about a year or so.Conclusion:  I like these tempered-glass protectors better.  I'll suffer through the occasional crack or edge scratch, and buy the two-pack so I have a spare.  The real bottom line though is that every bit of damage, scratching, dirt, etc.  is use and abuse that the watch itself won't have to directly endure.  Simple as that.  It's protecting a much bigger investment, and certainly good and cheap insurance.  Did I mention that I like the harder tempered-glass face?

    After spending countless of hours reading through reviews and trying to figure out which case I should buy for my brand new Apple Watch S9, I decided on this one and I do not regret it one bit. As others have mentioned, some water does get into the case when you are washing your hands, but in my opinion, it is very minimal.Some reviewers mentioned that the case is hard to take off, but it's really not that bad to take the case off to wipe the water and put it back on. I also wash my hands very frequently throughout the day and since the water that gets into the case (barely noticeable) does not affect the sensitivity, I take the case off once a day before going to bed to wipe the very little water that got in it. 5/5 stars

    I'm a decently good boulder/climber and I wanted to get a case that would allow me to wear my apple watch and not worry about smashing or scratching my watch face. Wore it for the first time climbing today and honestly it was doing pretty well until I had to do this hard move and hit my wrist into the wall and fully cracked the protector screen in like 4 places. It didn't break off and stayed intact. So honestly, it did its job, but now my protector screen is cracked and I wouldn't really keep it on since running my fingers over the screen is now scratchy.I actually like the pink color so much that I would buy it again and just not wear my watch climbing again.

    Love this cover. My husband just informed meOur daughter scratched her Apple Watch. But I took a look and thankfully I had this cover on it, and it cracked or broke the cover but her watch screen was fine! I had also bought an Otterbox watch cover to compare but it came with no clear covering, just a “bumper”. I’m so glad I used these covers over the otterbox one. I’m also glad there are 2!One thing I’d change or wish for, is that the area around the Digital Crown and side button were thinner because it’s harder to manipulate those things. That’s the only reason I gave it 4 stars.

    I am still rocking my Apple Series 3 Watch and this is a great protection solution for that watch. I do a lot of manual work and tend to be rough on my watches. I will try to provide some future updates to how this case stands up to my punishment. I purchased the black case in combination with the SUNFWR black metal watch band and it doesn't obstruct the new watch band. It looks like a new watch and matches perfectly with the black metal watch band. When installed, I found the touch controls to be very smooth and response and much better than my previous plastic film screen protector. Overall, I'm very happy with this case/screen protector combo.

    I just started using my Apple Watch again. I had a case on it that was pretty used and beat up. When I took it off, my Apple Watch could pass as new (not a scratch to the gold part or screen). I then used it for week without a case. While I loved the look of my watch (sleek, clean, and minimal), I still felt scared to get a scratch on it so I decided to buy a case. I was stuck between the black and clear. I am so glad I went with the CLEAR option! It allows me to clearly see the gold color of my watch and doesn’t take away almost at all from the original look. It isn’t bulky in my opinion and I’m so glad I made this purchase!

    I recently purchased the Apple Watch Ultra 2 ,and I purchased A different band for my watch which came with a case as well. The issue with that case was that the sensitivity of touching the screen was hard to do any typing on. I remember purchasing this brand for my Apple Watch SE And it worked beautifully. Not only protected my watch the touchscreen was flawless so once I found they made one for the Ultra 2 Watch I bought it the same day. As just Like before, the touchscreen is beautiful and flawless when typing any thing on it. I prefer this screen protector over any screen protector that Amazon has on their website….

    Yes - does everything they claim, it's easy to install, excellent protection, and touch functionality is very good...Only complaint is if you get it wet, as in wear watch in shower, water WILL get between the cover and the watch screen - not huge issue since it's so easy to pop off and dry, then reinstall... just remember it'll happen.I have now gotten where I don't wear the watch in shower, got tired of popping it off to dry out.Will try it in the pool soon and see how bad that does... expecting it to be much worse.So bottom line is, if you wear your watch in shower or swim with it, you probably don't want this...

    I dropped my watch that was hanging off of a towel hanger in my bathroom from about 4 feet. I picked it up, saw the screen was all cracked and was thinking the worse. It turns out it was only this rock hard, super protective case on my watch that was cracked! My watch was left undamaged, clean, and looking new. The case did its job 🫡 I’m thankful two come in one pack so now I can just put another one on. Definitely buying another set if my 2nd one does their job again

    These are great to put over your watch to protect it, but if you sweat a lot during workouts or you have your hands around water, it gets trapped in there making it almost impossible to tap anything until you remove the cover and fully dry both the watch and the inside of the cover. Despite that, the cover was great protection during my craft projects.

    Case works great, I bump my wrist on doorways a good bit and this has definitely held up well in keeping my watch face safe. I purchased the pink color about a month ago and am sad to see a lot of the pink around the screen is chipping away. I would expect this over time but definitely not at the rate at which it’s happening which is why I went for 4 instead of 5 stars. It does its job just wish the color wasn’t fading away.

    This is a good screen protector but be careful if you get water or condensation under the screen.  I was panicking that my apps didn’t respond to touch until I realized there was a tiny film of water preventing adequate contact.  After I removed the screen protector and cleaned it, everything worked fine again. Overall I am happy with the protection.

    I am so thankful I had this. It saved my watch.  Bought it for my son to help prevent issues but since it came with two, I put the extra on mine.

The shield was cracked but the watch was fine. Had I not had it, I would have been out a lot of money!!! Ordering a replacement now!

    I purchased this set back in Nov 2023 and last week, I finally broke the protective glass on the remaining protector. For $10 protection lasting 5 months of the brutality of moving, jumping in/on/out/from motorcycle, airplanes, hiking, and working out, I would've liked to past 6 months, to be realistic, bonus if a year, before needing another set. Due to my active lifestyle, the protective case does pop out randomly, easy to snap back into place though. Once water gets between the glass and the watch, you'll have to wipe dry surfaces to get back to touching capability.

    This watch protection device seems to be an answer to my klutziness!  So far it has worked to keep my watch screen intact even with fairly hard bumps.  It was a little tight to snap on - I was afraid it was going to break - but it did not and comes off easily as well.  Pack of two.

    These are so worth it. I’m rough on my watch and have hit it against many a door jam, car door, tree while hiking, etc. Each time I’m amazed that my watch didn’t break but that’s because the screen protector was there! I’ve tried a few and there’s are the only ones so far that don’t have weird dots or coloring and keep the touch sensitivity. I always stock up!

    there is nothing bad to say about this product. I wish I had found this sooner. To have something as easy as this with tempered glass to protect the Apple Watch screen is amazing. I've used other ones that have just had plastic coverings. They work in durable, but not nearly as much as this.

    I put it on my watch as soon as I got it, it fits perfect it was exactly what I was looking for. Though I find sometimes I have to tap a little harder or a few times to unlock my watch or hit anything towards the bottom other than that it’s good.

    Was delivered promptly and the package contained all products. The cover works well, better than one I had previously bought, as far as touch screen goes. I can't speak to how durable it is yet but I have found that most watch covers in this price range usually only hold up for 1-2 good hits; if this one does more than that I will be 100% satisfied.

    This is pretty easy to install and will do a great job protecting my watch, however you almost want to remove this every time you shower or doing dishes because water gets trapped underneath it. It's also not as touch sensitive so I'll catch myself frequently having to carefully touch it but think I'll eventually get used to that.

    Ordered this for my daughter who broke her watch screen. Once she got it repaired she ordered this but told me it was very hard for her to use her watch. Touching the screen has to be touched with much greater force and water constantly gets under it from her washing her hands. (I saw this in several reviews and thought people were swimming with it. Once she showed me how water got under it, it was very understandable why a lot of reviews said the same thing.) Wish there was a better way for water to not get under it so easily.

    Is not water proof. However after only wearing it over my watch, I was pushed against a door way in a crowded area. My instinct was to stop me from falling. As you can see, the cover cracked yet saved my watch.

    Great product overall.  It performs as it should; however, I got water under it (twice) and had to remove the cover so the screen could make positive contact with the screen and when I was putting it back on the second time, the protector cracked.  It still works and performs as advertised, and I had bought two.  Great product for those who are accident prone, just be careful getting water under it and removing the casing.  I'd buy again.

    I was at the gym today when I lost my balance with 135lbs on my shoulders. I smashed my watch into the bar hook shattering the tempted glass and with the force I thought my watch too. NOPE! My watch was perfectly fine and didn’t even have a scratch on it. The glass case had a hole in it and that’s why I thought my watch was totaled. This product saved my watch and a painful call to Apple care. The nice part is I came home and install the second one that it came with, so it’s fully protected again. So, I have just brought another pack, because, well I’m a clumsy Mfer lol.

    This really protects the Watch and didn’t add bulk. Maybe it’s me but you did have to press a tad bit harder to get things to pop up. Since I’m new to Apple Watch’s it may be not touching a smaller app.

    I am surprised at how often I bang the face of my Apple Watch against random objects, so I am glad to have this protector for it! Easy to install and the touch screen works perfectly. It has taken a relative beating from my clumsy self and shows no wear. I'd buy it again!

    I have been using the Misxi transparent case on my 45 mm Apple Watch 8 since it was new in December.  It has provided great protection.  I am not been too tough on my watch, but have occasionally hit it on walls or doors.  The case has protected the watch without cracking or scratching after two months of use.I've seen some reviews mentioning that water gets underneath the case.  It is my understanding that the case isn't intended to be waterproof and only protects from scratches.  I never submerge my watch in water and, therefore, have had no issues.  If water got under the case, it is fairly easy to remove to allow for drying.

    I’ve tried some others that would fall off easily when caught by something, but this one has stayed on and doesn’t allow water to seep in. I like the black color too - matches my black leather wristband and kinda gives my Ultra a stealth look!

    I just opened this to put it on my watch and the wet wipe was dry. I’ve purchased this in the past and not had a problem. Also, as a note to others, water seeps into the case when swimming or showering and makes it almost impossible to use the touch screen unless you remove the case and dry the watch face and inside of the protector. Other than that it works perfectly. Obviously I don’t have a problem with that as I bought it again.

    First, everyone’s ears are different. I sleep with ear plugs and they stretch my ear canal opening. The iPhone's Ear Tip Fit test failed initially, but I had to shove the tips deeper into my ear canal to get them to have a successful test. Not too large of an issue. I have one ear that fails the test no matter what, but my version 1 AirPod Pro may just be too old.The photos I uploaded show a comparison with the old Apple tip. In the photos, Apple's has an “M” for medium on the side and they are dirtier. You can see this new non-Apple model flares out a little at the bottom. It’s also deeper (farther out from the side). The Apple model has a thicker flare height but thinner distance from side. So, the new tip doesn't go as deep into the airpod when snapping into place. I used my fingernail to get it to go into the channel.Another note about this entry, when looking at the photos for this product, you’ll see there is no flare at all, but it’s not what you get in packaging as my photos show. However, the fit test is still successful for me, so I don't think that's an issue.Lastly, you’ll see the sound hole is smaller in the new model, but I can’t tell a sonic difference in sound quality. i just wanted to point out that the difference is not important in case you notice it.As another reviewer mentions, Apple does sell their own tips, but they don't offer a multi-size kit like this. I did purchase one of those to see if they'd work for my earbud that keeps failing the test, and their design is actually different than the original that came with my version 1 AirPods. The design is actually closer to these -- making it not anymore valuable to purchase outside of Amazon.So, overall, a worthy buy for a multi-size set. Priced right. Ships lightening fast. Good packaging. Great to have a case. Definitely recommended.

    The material and the sizes are different from Apple. The material feels cheap, and size are slightly bigger than apple’s original. And the noise cancellation got weaker, not sure if it’s because the fit and the thinner material or just my AirPod getting old.

    I like the fact that they fit , I’ve had my pros for a year and had so many issues with keeping them in my ear (I have small ears) I wasn’t aware you can change the buds until I was told so I purchase these and trying them out I can finally keep them in my ear , I’m just a little mad that the bud falls off the ear bud when removing it from my ear I thought I was doing it wrong I have long nails so my sister helped me and it was the same thing ! I say 50/50 because I’m happy they work but sad that the bud cap falls off .

    I’ve read the negative reviews and quite honestly, I have no idea where these people are coming from. I was very skeptical when I ordered these but they are a much better product than the OEM tips I had. In particular the noise cancellation on the OEM AirPods was never very good (particularly when flying) and I could never get the volume high enough to mitigate the outside noise. However these replacements are perfect and made a huge difference in the noise cancelation department—didn’t need to increase the volume on my AirPods to maximum volume in a noisy environment for the first time since I’ve owned the AirPods.

    They seem a bit flimsier that the original set, but I've been using this set for a couple months now and they are working well. I'm not terribly picky on sound quality (mostly use for web conferencing) but the sound seems as good as Apple tips.

    The tips on my airpods had a tear at the base and wanted a replacement as quickly as possible. These were going to get here a bit faster than if I ordered the Apple brand from Apple, so decided to give them a try. They attached and work just like the originals, and I don't notice any difference in sound or functionality. Highly recommend if you can't get a hold of the Apple brand versions.

    I find that these tips make my Air Pods fall out of my ears more easily. Other than that, I have had no issues with them.

    I used another set from a different vendor and they kept sliding out. This time I also used a smaller size and I rarely deal with them falling out. Definitely much more happy with this set.

    I was a little iffy about ordering a different brand other than Apple. Well I’m glad I did because I ended up liking them way more than the original ones my pods came with. They don’t slide out of my ears and don’t dry out my ears the way Apple ones did. Will repurchase once my current ones give out

    As others have noted, you need to remove the white extra plastic piece on the Airpods to install. This caught me off guard and required a tweezers to remove. After than, install was easy.

    So far i see nothing wrong about the mouse after a month. It’s many lightyears better than my $9.00 mouse that glitches the DPI. Whenever i sometimes move my mouse and it randomly X out all my tabs without moving it to that direction. Which is annoying as hell.Pros: Im not too critical about mouses but i will give my realistic and honest opinion from my experience. Very beautiful design and color options. In a normal perspective it’s 100% worth it for gaming and work. If you’re going for superficial things that will give you a premium feel. Then you won’t be completely satisfied. I’ve tried many mouses such as the Gpros, Glorious, etc. It definitely doesn’t compare when it comes to features and battery life. But what i mostly like is that it’s a bit over average ish. It’s better than 80% of the mouses that i’ve bought on Amazon. I know it’s an oddly eccentric and egregious claim but it’s way better than most of the cheaper mouse than this.. you can find.Cons:Well i just said i never really experience any issues with it. But I can presume and rule out some possible issues from a different person perspective. What others might think about it. I don’t have issues with connection problems but some might do depending on what monitor they use. For its cheap price, I would notice the plastic feel of it. But with the slightly above average contemporary features for a good deal. Again if you’re going for superficial like advanced settings, etc. Then your expectations are staggeringly out of place with its regressive appearance and performance. I would point out the sleep mode that occurs before a minute. Which shuts off the RGB, i mean it could bother some people who like to show off.Overall thought, this mouse in particular is better than a typical mouse. Way better than getting a mouse from your dad (if he’s cheap). But eh this is my overall opinion from my experience.

    Bought this when my logitech G pro wireless mouse stop charging or would read the wrong battery percentage. Nothing like going into a game thinking its charged and dies.. Regardless I searched reddit and the solution was to bang the mouse down on a table, maybe the battery was loose or something (Ima go hard) and that seemed to fix it. I saw cases it would jump 30-50% in battery life. Tested it myself, It worked for me surprisingly. The logitech mouse started acting up again after about 3 months, so I decided I should at least test this first. In my opinion I think it comparable maybe identical. If you did a blind test they might pick this that is how close it is. I was concerned about the ms delay but I tested both and they benchmarked the same, granted my logitech is a bit older. I do run my monitor at 144hz so that could be a factor, but regardless I think it's just as good and it fits the hand perfect. Pretty smooth when on a mouse pad as well, maybe a tad more friction but feels nice and kind of helped the gaming elbow. I generally play at like 800-1200 DPI so 8000 is plenty. For reference I play mobas like league and fps games like cod. Windows mouse sense 10/20 seems to be the best. If your on the fence I think you should try it, I almost like mine better because the click is quiter. Thank you for your time.

    First off, it's important that I point out that I didn't buy this for gaming, but for daily work primarily so it's through those lens that I am reviewing this product. Also, I didn't install the software as I didn't want any additional bloat, but you will probably need it if you want more control of the colors and battery status etc. I have used it for a month or so to get a good feel for how it is.Now with that out of the way, some important things I wanted to mention about the mouse that weren't clear that might benefit others.- DPI or dots per inch affects the speed at which the mouse will move across the screen. If you are noticing very slow mouse movement (saw some reviews mention this), then increase the DPI and see if that gets you to something you like. The buttons are labeled in the manual. You can also try adjusting mouse speed in your OS (I'll leave that to you to figure out for your specific OS).- Report/polling rate affects the frequency at which the mouse communicates with the computer. In theory, the higher, the better accuracy, but also the greater drain on battery as it has to do more. Without the software, the rates correlate to color flashed on the scroll wheel when you set it using button on the bottom of the mouse. The rates allowed are 125 red/250 blue/500 green/1000Hz pink.Ok, so onto the pros:- Cost is fairly good. Considering you are getting a wireless mouse that can be plugged in and function as a wired mouse, it's fairly affordable.- Very accurate and I notice no lag with usage. I run at 250Hz poll rate (blue), though to be honest, I don't really notice any difference at 125Hz. Again, not gaming, so your mileage may vary, but give you can bump it up to 1000Hz, it should be adequate for most. I did confirm the poll rates online. You can google for sites that will report the detected poll rate of the mouse if you are interested in seeing it and from those sites, I did see the mouse was polling at the rates they claimed.- Rapid fire works as claimed and triggers 3 left mouse button clicks. I don't have a need for it so can't speak to how well it works in games or if the software allows any tuning of the rate at which it clicks 3 times, but there's no way to do it on the mouse itself.- Battery life is ok. I get roughly a week out of it using it for work. I have it on normal power on mode which means the LEDs are on so long as the mouse is actively getting used. I also use it on 250Hz polling for reference. LEDs go out after a minute and mouse goes to sleep after 5. The scroll wheel blinks red to let you know it is running low and will light up as stable green when fully charged (at least it is supposed to though it doesn't always do that but that may be related to the con listed later on about this).- Uses USB-C.- Wireless connectivity is stable. I use it 95% of the time wirelessly and only plug it in to charge and don't really notice any connectivity issues/lag.Cons:- It admittedly feels and looks cheap in some respects. The plastic feels very cheap. The scroll wheel looks probably the worst in that regards as just mostly plastic wheel that has a rubber tire or sorts on it. That said, the wheel feels and behaves fine for the most part and I care more about the function than the form so I don't necessarily care too much, but if you want something that looks premium, this probably won't do.- About that scroll wheel, it doesn't have horizontal tilt if you want to scroll left/right. That may or may not matter to you. For gaming, probably better it doesn't, but for normal work, I prefer having it so it was a bit of a let down for me.- LEDs are decent. They are RGB as you can see the same sections change color, unlike some that claim to be RGB but really only light up one color, but that said, you can see the individual sections. It doesn't look seamless as the colors transition down the mouse in some color modes making it very obvious where the different LED sections are. Probably would have required more LEDs to get the nicer affect, but it still looks fairly decent as a whole.- No way to keep the LEDs on. It turns off if it's idle and as I type most of the time rather than use the mouse, it is off a lot. For those who care about having it on all the time, just know that won't be possible.- Deep sleep after 5 mins is a huge annoyance. You have to scroll the wheel or click to re-wake it. While the other stuff I have listed is mostly superficial and I don't really mind at the end of the day, this 'feature' does bother me. I would prefer if it could wake on motion or something.- The charging/wire is a bit finnicky. I sometimes have to unplug and replug it multiple times for it to really make a good connection and get detected by the computer/charge. At first I thought I just wasn't seating it in all the way, but that was definitely not the issue. It also seems that it prefers having the plug go in with the cable flipped in a specific direction. Given this is USB-C and you shouldn't have to care which way it plugs in, so it adds to the cheap feel of the product. I might have gotten a defective component or something here, so you may have better luck with this. While annoying, it is still overall functional and not worth the headache of an exchange for me. I just put some tape on the usb cable to indicate the side it wants up and it works most of the time now when I plug it in that way. This alone probably cost it a star.- Ergonomics are a bit average for me, but that is hugely personal preference and depends on your anatomy so it's hard to knock it for that too much. I prefer a slight slant to the mouse with the left button a bit higher than the right to allow me wrist to rest in a more comfortable position, but that's not for everyone.Overall, for the price, you get a decent mouse. Most of the cons again are rather superficial, but if you are getting something like this with LEDs etc, the look and feel is what you are getting it for so the fact that it looks and feel slightly on the cheap side is a bit of a let down. I wouldn't discourage buying it necessarily for just that (probably docked it 1 start just for those things combined), and given a choice, I'd buy this mouse again if those were the only issues, but I get it if that is enough to make you say no. The bigger issue for me is the poor usb-c connection/port and the lack of wake up on motion.Hopefully this review helps you.

    First off, ""WOW!"" I do so love this gaming mouse from Redragon. This is the Ranger Lite M910-KS wired/wireless RGB gaming mouse in all its glory.Here's my thoughts in no particular order:1) The mouse has a great weight/balance ratio that's not difficult on the hand or wrist. I'm an average sized build guy but it just feels tight and right cradled in my hand. The texture of the grippy wheel and the ""clicky"" of the keys are a satisfying relief during extended use.2) The quality of materials used feels superb. The long, thick included USB-C cable for charging and/or wired play was a welcome addition. Feels like something most cell phone companies have no problem charging you $40 for..3) The free customization software (www.redragonzone.com) is simple to install and easy to use. It may not be the most in-depth customization tool I've ever seen but it certainly does the basics plus you can import/export profile layouts which is a handy feature for those migrating over to this little guy from another mouse.4) The RGB lights are very captivating and comes with 9 preset (mostly adjustable) motion styles. Some of the color shifts seem a tad sluggish depending on how you tweak them but that's me grasping for something neutral to have to add.5) The three buttons on the top of the mouse. Out of the box there are a set to control + & - DPI to one of 5 adjustable presets (250-8,000 with the optional software) with the third to cycle between lighting modes. To me, that's really all these buttons are good for as to where they're located.  Not for practical gaming use unless you have crazy carpel tunnel syndrome. You can always remap them for use as media controls and other things you won't be using on the fly often but that's three buttons i won't be using for gaming myself.6) So far the battery hasn't given me any reasons for concern. I read others complain about this very thing but from what all it's doing wirelessly I'm frankly impressed. Sometimes I think some people will just never be satisfied.  It comes with a charge cable.. CHARGE IT! You can charge the battery and still use the mouse while doing so as long as it's wired to a USB port on your PC.7) Speaking about connection, the Nano USB receiver that you use for wireless play is idiot-proof. Plug receiver into USB port, turn mouse On (or to ECO) and that's it! You're connected. No software needed for that. In fact, no software of any kind is required to use this versatile mouse. ONLY if you want to benefit from the extra customization options like remapping of the keys, colors, macros etc would you need the FREE software from Redragon.  Okay! So that my fellow geeks and gamers is my humble review of the Redragon Ranger Lite M910-KS RGB Mouse. Not the most elite thing out there, but for $29.99 with FREE Prime Shipping you simply can't beat this budget-friendly intro/advanced gaming mouse. It excels in what you really need out a mouse and gives you plenty of extras to have some fun with and make it your own. All in all it receives an ""A"" in my book!""Thank you, RD!""~Kali Alley Kat~

    If you keep it on Eco mode, it will last quite a while. If you don't, prepare to keep it charging every night. Don't want it to die in the middle of your next game.

    Pretty lights, decent batt life, game for days very long sessions no problem. only annoyance is you click to wake the mouse, and sometimes if you're hovering over something bad it will click it. Prob a way around that by right clicking to wake or something

    I am very pleased with this gaming mouse it matches my aesthetic and set up perfectly and on top of that is very responsive when gaming I love how I have so many options on setting the sensitivity is very lightweight it feels great in the hand even during long hours of gaming. It got to me a day late but it was worth the wait.

    All features work well. The wireless and recharge is fantastic. The only reason for 4 stars is because the ergonomics are not quite as good as some other mouses I have but for a portable mouse it does the job well. Would recommened. Will update if I have issues.

    I was looking for a wireless RGB sleek looking white mouse and this was one of the only options that looked appealing at its price range. The color options are nice though I wish it was a bit brighter or showed more of the lights around the mouse but it’s still nice. It’s worth noting that I use this for my work computer not for gaming so I can’t speak on that. It gets the job done for what I use it for.

    When I going to buy something, I used to make a hard research in all internet about brands, hardware, benefits, disadvantages, you know everything about when one of us want to be advised. In this caseThis mouse gaming mouse, is powerful, It offers a lot of specs than others can offer respect its price, is cheap and good. But if the money isn't important to you, you could choose a premium brand, of course Redragon have premium series, but It is a great buy

    Great mouse to use on the ROG Ally and Steam Deck and I'm certain it'll work just fine with other handhelds. I'm using the Jsaux Dock Station 12-in-1 and it works as expected.

    I got this mouse because mine stopped working and I wanted to try a new brand that's also wireless. I was hesitant to get it because I was worried the charging would be an ordeal, but the battery life lasts forever. When it first came, I'm assuming it arrived fully charged which was great. I'd say it lasted near a week out of the box before I had to charge it. I've only had to charge it a few times since I've gotten it and you dont even have to charge it for very long. The only things I would criticize is that it feels a bit cheap, at least compared to my old mouse. It's very light feeling, and its easy to bend the plastic as when it arrived the clicker part was bent up onto the packaging and I thought it was broken. It was not broken, it snapped right back in place but I feel like that's worth mentioning if you're looking for something more heavy. The settings and colors are nice, the LEDS aren't consistent looking, I can see where they're placed but it doesn't bother me too much, it still lights up. overall it's a perfectly decent mouse and I'm satisfied given the price.

    So I’ve had this mouse about six months now and it still works like a charm but the lights have started to not work quite right . Not quite sure why either done A LOT of troubleshooting but just kinda seems like somethings not wired right . Other than that a very solid gaming mouse for price .

    Bought this to replace a 3 year old budget gaming mouse with a faulty CMOS sensor. Been using it for 5 or 6 days for general desktop use in eco mode and I still haven't had to charge it.Really just decent, all the way around. Won't compare to a top of the line mouse but it is better than most of the garbage out there, even mice costing twice as much.This is a really good alternative to something like a Logitech M720 for non-gamers because it is more precise and cheaper. It is also slightly lighter which will make a difference after 12 hours of video editing.

    I like this mouse quite a bit, but I'm a fan of colors and lights. It works pretty well and I don't have too much of a problem with it.Minor problems:Charge seems to not last a long as I was hoping for. I have to charge it every 4-5 days, though I do use it at least a few hours a day.Mouse is for larger hands. My thumb cannot reach one of the side buttons. Not really a negative, but something to consider for those with smaller hands.

    I'm coming from a Logitech G502 wired mouse which I've had for at least 7 years. It was a good mouse (obviously as it lasted a very long time) and was still functioning perfectly but I wanted a wireless for my gaming. And I absolutely loathe the Logitech software (so there's that).This Red Dragon is checking all the boxes so far, but I've had it less than a week.The one flaw I've found, and it's been mentioned in other reviews, is the sleep function. I don't mind that it sleeps but I would like to have a wake on motion function instead of a button click, which can affect your position depending on where that cursor happens to be when you click one of the three wake buttons. Maybe they can fix this on a firmware update. Maybe?

    I love how smooth the mouse is once it's connected. Playing fast paced games like Apex Legends and Overwatch with this mouse is great! The DPI settings fit my playstyle well, the RGB settings are gorgeous. There's only 1 downside that didn't show up initially. As advertised, charging the mouse does show a red glow in the middle wheel indicating that it's still charging and eventually green once it's fully charged. 3 weeks later once charging it, the red glow doesn't show up anymore but it does charge since I continuously used it without dying on me.Overall, great product but the charging indicator seems lacking eventually.

    Redragon Gaming Mouse Beats Other Gaming Mice To start off with, I think that the Redragon gaming mouse is one of the best mice as of right now. I have owned this mouse for about 3 years and it is just as good as brand new. When looking at the price of this mouse compared to other gaming mice, this is cheaper, durable, longer-lasting, and has most of the features as the other expensive mice have. I would most certainly recommend any interested buyers looking for a gaming mouse to buy this product. First and foremost, I think that the Redragon gaming mouse is one of the best mice as of right now because it’s cheap and affordable. When looking for a desktop gaming mouse, you should always research and look for other products that might be similar, less expensive, and easier to use especially when it comes to gaming mice. One of the popular gaming mice that is competing against the redragon mice in the market as of right now would be the glorious model o. This mouse comes around $100 in the market and functions similarly to the redragon mouse. The redragon mouse comes in around $20 as of now due to inflation as well. There isn’t much of a difference between the two mice besides the shape, size, and price. Paying $80 more isn’t worth it if most of the controls, and key features function the same way. Some of the key features that the glorious model o can do as well as the redragon gaming mouse are drag click, butterfly click, has the same amount of sensitivity, and DPI. The main difference between these two desktop gaming mice is that the glorious model “o” feels much lighter and sturdier. The redragon mouse feels a little bit heavier however, it is a decent size for any beginners or experienced gamers. It also has side palm grips for you to keep your thumb, ring finger, and pinky finger on support giving you the most comfortable experience as well. Some of the features that both mice can do that interested buyers would look forward to is having the mouse double click, drag click, and butterfly click. Furthermore, this mouse is very comfortable and durable for a long period of time. The gaming mouse's texture is matte which makes the gaming experience even better. There are also side buttons to change the RGB color or lighting to whichever settings you’d prefer with 7-8 different color options. All of these features are adjustable just by downloading the app or software if needed. After owning this product for 3 years, I have not felt the need to buy another mouse yet at all because of how well-made it is. However, despite all of the pros mentioned, there are always a few flaws or cons since nothing is perfect. One of the cons I experienced by owning this product would be that when gaming, some of the clicks on the redragon gaming mouse don’t register due to how big it is. Even though it is recommended to have lighter-weight desktop mice when gaming, it makes it harder to click while having some clicks not register. Over the past 3 years of owning this product, I have noticed that there is also a solution to fixing this problem. I have improved my gaming skills and it has made clicking faster and much easier for me. I would most definitely recommend this product to gamers who are at least experienced a little bit and have fast clicking hands to enjoy the full experience.

    Just ordered a second one of this model after owning my first one for a year now. I have a cat that particularly loves destroying my mouse cords. Irony aside, I think it's a jealously thing. My original purchase of this was to be a cheaper replacement for my Razr Naga which costs 4x the price, yet this mouse was barely a step down - only lacking the macro keys but gaining the full RGB lights instead of just the only green that old Razr model had. The RGB on this mouse is pretty good, good enough that I like to keep it on the flowing rainbow setting to match my similar effect on the Red Dragon mechanical macro keyboard that I bought a few months after this mouse because I was impressed with the brand quality.Ergonomically it's great. Perfectly shaped large enough that you won't get hand cramps if using the device for extended periods of time. It handles with enough accuracy for 99.99% of people and only tournament ranking professionals would have reason to complain.My only negative point on this mouse is that multiple buttons are too easy to press on accident. It shouldn't be much of an issue for most people, but the side buttons stick out quite far, and it's very easy to press those back/forward buttons when first moving your hand onto the device. But once you've got a grip on it, that stops being a problem and instead a possible benefit, as those 2 side buttons are very easy to press when you want to. The top buttons that control the RGB and DPI suffer from much the same issue. Very easy to accidentally touch them and change the settings accidently. Yet once you hand is on the device, they're not in the way and you're unlikely to accidentally press either button.Build quality it's solid, and amazing for the price. It's notably not as well built as the $80 Razr mouse that I replaced with it, but the difference is small enough that I'd even consider them to be solidly in the same range of mid-cost device.As a side complaint, I'm annoyed that both of the aforementioned pointing devices, especially the $80 Razr one, do not have detachable and replaceable USB cords. I shouldn't have to buy a new device entirely just because the cord is damaged, yet a majority of mice on the market do not have swappable cords. Red Dragon definitely gets a pass on their purposefully cost-cutting design, but it's much more annoying on a luxury like the Naga.

    This is a great entry level gaming mouse for those that are new to gaming on pc or for the loved one that just wants a cool looking mouse. It  get the job done. Do keep in mind it is wired and the RGB can not be customized. If you that feature, u may have to fork up more money on a higher end RGB mouse. However, if just want it to look good and perform well, this mouse will complete that job.I myself have gotten a high end mouse but i still use this from time to time on my gaming laptop  whenever i travel. 9/10

    Bought this mouse as a replacement for my G502 HERO mouse that has a damaged dongle.Although a bit smaller than I thought (only by about an inch in diameter, not an issue) It feels great!As someone who has long fingers, it's very hard to find a mouse that fits my hands and has the grip I need to play comfortably, has a very high DPI setting, and very customizable lighting software.The box was a cute case that I use to store my old mouse as a backup.My only nitpick was I with it had a higher DPI cap, but again, not an issue.Very recommended product.

    I've had this mouse for 3 years now. My previous mouse was a Razer Naga Molten that was in desperate need of replacing, I decided to look for something that was more all around and cheaper (since the Naga molten was more of MMO/MOBA centric mouse and it was kinda pricey). It's worked pretty well for the last 3 years I've owned it. Very smooth and responsive mouse, practically glides across the pad and it works very well for gaming & work. The driver software also offers you a lot of settings that you can tweak to your preference.Highly recommend.

    I got this to replace an old, failing mouse. I like the textured scroll wheel and the lights make it easy to see in the dark. It's also durable AF...dropped it repeatedly (not on purpose) and it just keeps going like nothing happened.

    I really love the ergonomics of this mouse. It's exactly what I look for when purchasing. It is comfortable to hold and fits in my hand like a glove. Every button press is exactly where I want it to be. I thought the price is insanely good for such a high quality mouse, surely something must be amiss. And I wasn't wrong...Where this mouse fails to deliver is the polling rate. It claims to have the ability to go up to 1000MHz and even provides the option in its software. But let me assure you, it is not 1000MHz polling rate. I would be surprised if it was even 500MHz. The cursor never feels ""smooth"" no matter how I tuned it via acceleration, speed, Windows settings, etc. On desktop, or games like MOBAs or strategy, it's fine. For first person shooters, it feels like a stuttery mess unless the game provides some form of mouse smoothing.And the reality is, for gaming it is far from the perfect mouse. Maybe it's the lazer, maybe the 1000MHz polling rate is a lie, I don't know. The unfortunate reality is the cursor is not smooth. I own multiple high end gaming mice, where the difference is night and day compared to this mouse. It's unfortunate, I really love how this one feels. But the reality always comes through that you get what you pay for.My conclusion is it's not a bad mouse, unless you really need precision. Then it's a really bad mouse.

My experience with the Redragon M602 White has been quite a journey. There are certainly areas where it excels, but it does have its pitfalls.To start, the software and driver support for the M602 White is a nightmare. The mouse doesn't have dedicated software, and despite my efforts to navigate Redragon's unorganized website for a compatible program, I came up empty-handed. Interestingly, this product isn't even listed on their Global site but is available on their American site. It's a rather perplexing situation. The mouse shows up as a ""HID-Compliant Mouse"" in Windows 11. When attempt to use software made by RedDragon to connect to the mouse for button remapping and RGB control you are told ""Gaming mouse disconnected"" when it's clearly not. There is no software or driver for this mouse. It's purely a plug and play device. It's not even recognized as anything more or less then a generic mouse on Windows 11.I strongly advise against trying to install software not specifically designed for this mouse model. I tried to do just this for writing this product review. My attempt at installing M602-RGB software resulted in a catastrophic lockout of my mouse clicking capabilities on my Windows 11 machine. I had to fix the issue by navigating using only the keyboard and TAB key to uninstall the software. It was a nerve-wracking ordeal. Without any RedDragon software installed, the M602 White, along with my other computer mice, work fine.The M602 is equipped with on-board controls for adjusting the RGB lighting and DPI settings, located beneath the scroll wheel. The color modes and DPI are controlled via a series of button presses. Understanding the interplay between DPI changes and color cues was tricky at first, but the product manual clarified this. Cycling through the color modes leads to my favorite - the rainbow setting.For its price point, the M602 is a decent investment if you're seeking a cheap, stylish, RGB-enabled mouse. I almost returned it but decided to keep it for its aesthetics. While I would have preferred a black model with a higher DPI range, the existing DPI level of the M602 works fine for my non-competitive gaming needs.The RGB elements are a major plus for me, especially the bright colors and smooth transitions of the rainbow setting. I even wrapped the long connecting cable in a gold plastic wrap to enhance its aesthetics. Despite being one of Redragon's cheaper models, the quality holds up. The durable plastic container that comes with the mouse has been also been repurposed for other uses thanks to some added magnets.I am pleased with the M602 White, and I would consider buying a higher-end model from Redragon again when I need a new computer mouse. RedDragon may not produce flawless products, but the quality is solid for the price. I would recommend the M602 White, but with the clear warning about its software issues.

    This was originally a really good mouse. With wear and tear, it's gets a lot less nice. The circular dragon on the palm completely wore through. Also, the fact that it's white, if you don't wash your hands before every time you use your computer, there's going to be a lot of gunk that builds up on the different buttons, so make sure you wash your hands or be prepared to have to clean this mouse about once a month with a fine tool to keep it clean. Also, if you have a desk with a sharp edge to it, chances are the chord will fray as well like mine did. I don't know why they make the cord with a breakable material, better off with a typical rubber like coating.

    Reviews on this M602 webpage are quite similar to those of lots of other Redragon mice listed by Amazon. Not all these reviews have been assigned to the correct mouse sibling, however, because of bewilderment created by their abundance and similarities among many siblings in an enormous litter. Confusion about which mouse is which is apparent even on the multiple websites Redragon itself publishes all over the world. At any rate, most reviewers agree that the company produces good mice, and that its process for obtaining the specific driver software you need for tinkering with them sucks.Thus my comments may apply to many Redragon mice, but my experience involves only the M602 Griffin. He is a cute little critter with a lot of gee-whizzy multicolored lights, which you can make perform tricks such as altering his “breathing” depth and rate. (If you set them too low I wonder if he becomes erratic from hypoxia, and then do all his lights turn blue?) He has a magnificent, truly elegant, long red and black braided tail that looks like it should belong to a mouse perched much nearer the top of the pecking (gnawing?) order. At a remarkably low price he meets my need for a precise mouse to set various instrument knobs and gauges in the glass panel instruments of my flight simulator very well. The rest of this long tale …involves his software.His box contained only my mouse himself, a Redragon decal and a useless 40-page set of “Operating Instructions” in 35 or so languages. Under “Software Instructions” it says “Users can adjust … settings through the software after downloading and installing it.” But there are no clues about where find that software. Be prepared for frustration when you begin an internet search. Mine led me down several blind alleys at places like redragonzone.com, redragon-global.com and redragon.store. Early in my journey through this maze, at redragonusa.com I spotted an M602. Its picture looked identical to my mouse and there was a link to download its driver. “That’s too easy,” I mumbled, and I was right. The link led to a file called MNEMEANLION.zip. Which proved to be a nearly complete dud. It did unzip and load into my computer, but here was no shortcut to open a GUI, and each of its three executable files did nothing useful. At least they did no harm.Further along my torturous route through the maze I discovered lurking there a total of 50 different Redragon mice and about 30 drivers. After eventually overcoming this diabolical plot to hide software on the internet I tracked down the correct M602 Griffin programming utility, at (drumroll please) redragonshop.com/pages/software. Its compressed driver file is named “m602.rar” (see screenshot of its GUI). It works, and unless it contains some undetectable malware planted there by the Chinese MSS it also does no harm. But as noted by other reviewers, moving its various sliders yields only very minor changes in some of Griffin’s behaviors.Bottom line: my rating of 4 stars would have been a lot lower had I not felt challenged by reading many previous reviews that talk about software problems but fail to reveal their solutions. I’m still euphoric from my detective work. But I sure wish that Mr. and Mrs. Redragon, who must be exempt from China’s one-litter policy, would learn about birth control, or would provide less intrepid customers with a roadmap of their maze.

    Look, I know gamers like to brag about how much all their equipment costs, but for those of us who'd rather spend the money on the actual games instead of a million dollar mouse, you won't find better than this. It's smooth and extremely comfortable. Plus it comes in a really cool case AND the dragon emblem on the mouse itself lights up. Worth every penny.

    1. Affordable Price: One of the standout features of the Redragon M602 is its budget-friendly price. It's an excellent choice for gamers on a tight budget or those looking for a secondary gaming mouse.2. RGB Lighting: The RGB lighting on this mouse is a nice touch, especially considering its price. You can customize the lighting effects through Redragon's software, adding a bit of flair to your setup.3. Comfortable Design: The ergonomic design of the mouse makes it comfortable to hold for extended gaming sessions. The textured side grips provide a secure and comfortable grip, and the mouse fits well in the hand.4. Customizable Buttons: With 7 programmable buttons, you have the flexibility to set up macros and shortcuts to enhance your gaming experience. This is a nice feature to have, especially at this price point.Cons:1. Build Quality: The build quality of the Redragon M602 leaves something to be desired. It feels a bit plasticky and less durable compared to higher-end gaming mice. Over time, this may affect its longevity.2. Sensor and Accuracy: The mouse uses an Avago sensor, which is decent but not as precise as some of the sensors found in more expensive gaming mice. This can lead to issues with accuracy, especially in fast-paced games.3. Software: While the mouse does come with customization software, it's not the most user-friendly. Setting up macros and adjusting DPI settings can be a bit cumbersome, and the software lacks some of the features offered by other gaming mouse software.4. Cable Quality: The cable is not as flexible as some other gaming mice, which can lead to drag and affect your movement during gaming.5. Weight: The Redragon M602 is on the heavier side, which might not be suitable for gamers who prefer lightweight mice for faster and more precise movements.Conclusion:The Redragon M602 RGB Wired Gaming Mouse is a budget-friendly option that offers some decent features for its price. It's comfortable to hold, has customizable RGB lighting, and programmable buttons. However, it falls short in terms of build quality, sensor precision, and software usability. If you're on a tight budget and need a gaming mouse for casual gaming, the Redragon M602 can get the job done. However, if you're a serious gamer looking for top-notch performance and build quality, you might want to consider investing a bit more in a higher-end gaming mouse.

    If you're looking for a cool-looking mouse with basic RBG features at a low price, consider this one. It would work best with a red theme in my opinion (simply because the cord is red) but I have mine tuned to a nice icy blue just to light up my PC dungeon when the lamp is off.By searching up their software, you can map basic macros to it (I set mine to automatically do a ""grapple"" move in The Force Unleashed II) and it has a total of 6 clickable buttons in addition to the wheel. If you don't care about that, you can disable the buttons, switch them around, or map them to common actions like copy, paste, stop/play, go back, open ""run"", etc.You can also adjust the rate at which the pointer moves across the screen using the DPI menu in the software. By default, the mouse has one of the middle buttons mapped to cycling through various preset DPI settings, and will have the other middle button mapped to cycling through RGB presets. Of course, both of these can be disabled or changed.There's a lot of subjectivity in this point, but I find it pretty comfortable. The top of the mouse might be a bit too wide for smaller hands.All in all, it's nothing special, but it's great bang for the buck and perfect for a budget gaming PC build.

    My son has gone through a few different PC Mice before landing on this one.  This is his second version of this particular Mouse, which is gloss white.  His first one was matt black.  There is a notable differenc in feel between glossy and matt.  Cleaning is also a bit easier with gloss, but some people may like the feel of the rubbery matt texture.  He likes it for speed and clicks and it fits comfortably in his middle-schooler hand.  We like the Red Dragon products for their price and performance.  As with many PC products, there are so many as to boggle the mind.  I do recommend this brand and product though.

    07Mar2023 update:Well, as I've found online, for all - the mouse works. However the web site has two variations ...USA ...zone and while one may get a single page to load I cannot navigate the site - getting error 500 which is a significant error, not a broken page, URL, etc.There is a wireless version that comes up as well (didn't want wireless, just saying) - same experience.So, per my experience, for it's price point - forget the ""programable"" buttons. I don't see any ""driver"" or ""App"" that would then load and change the operation of the mouse (again, I'd love to disable the two FWD/BAK buttons for being poorly placed for ""me""). I'll learn to keep my thumb away - I hope. Also, the DPI steps to the max, will be what they are. I hoped for possibly a different range to a different, ""lower"" maximum.So again, it's a fine mouse for this price point. Nevertheless since not as advertised, went from 4 Stars to 3. I rarely give a 5 Star review since as many ""here"" may do - keep that for amazing value, experience, product maximum-ness.Again, I hope that helps someone in a meaningful way.--- original review upon receipt is below ---So far, it's not bad. I need an accurate mouse, stable and with reasonable adjustable pointer movement.For me, it jumps, steps up to the 7200 DPI to quickly, which for me would be less accurate work. One step below prior to that DPI would fit me very well. The DPI just below it works, and I can adjust my hand in time.It speaks of software to ""program"" it - the only place is on the outside lable for a URL. I fully realize I can search for one too, nevertheless would prefer a, ""as purchased customer recognised URL for that"" - if could matter once there I will see.For me, the FWD/BAK side buttons I'd like to disable if can. Occassionally my thumb hits it and I find myself magically elsewhere - realised what happened just hit the other button. Again, I don't want or need them ""now"" and hope I can disable them if ""programable"" to do nothing.Otherwise, and for the price at this time - I'd recommend this to anyone wanting, needing a mouse that ""appears"" may last. There was a time, they just did - last. My last mouse lasted 6 mo's - first time in my lifetime of computing. The wireless are just not a good fit since use it so much and aggrevating with the batteries so need a Wired Mouse.If it winds up lasting and at this price, well then, - wonderful :) and thank you.I hope that helps someone in some meaningful way, - even spreadsheet office workers - not gamers.

    [UPDATE]I just bought another one of these.  Since I bought the last one, I also bought a Logitech, a Corsair, and a Razer.  I like the Logitech a bit more but it was several times the price and it lives on my gaming desk because I don't want to damage it.  This mouse is better than the Corsair or the Razor, and it's cheap enough to toss in a backpack without much concern about breaking it.  Once again I had to do physical mods to get rid of the pointless lightshow; no idea why they keep spending more money to make their product worse by including this 'feature'.  I took pictures this time.Here is the process:1.) Press on the mouse feet with your fingers until you find where the screw holes are.2.) Poke through with an xacto knife, trim away around the screws so that there is a nice chamfer on the remaining material (you don't want bits that will get stuck on stuff while in use) (see picture).3.) Remove the 4 screws.4.) Pry up the mouse by the white area on the back side.5.) Unplug the wire going to the top half of the mouse.6.) Pull up the right side of the mouse to remove it.7.) Unscrew and unplug the board attached to the wheel...it can be tossed.8.) Clip the legs of the 4-lead LED and toss it as well.9.) Using a side cutter or small pliers, crush the led's (circled in image) until there is nothing left but the traces below.  Shake the little bits into the trash; you don't want them rattling around in the mouse.10.) Plug the top half of the mouse back in and reattach with the 4 screws.11.) (optional) - You can buy mouse foot material that can be cut to various shapes, or that comes in generic shapes.  This can be used to replace the mouse feet that you have to cut to get to the screws, but I find that just doing a quality cut leaves the old feet perfectly functional.I know that's not the 'correct' way to remove LED's, but it is the easiest given the way this mouse is assembled, and I don't intend to reuse them anyway.[/UPDATE]The mouse is great.  It fits my large hand well.  Tracks well even on a cheap plastic table.  Clicks all work perfectly, including the wheel.  The software is terrible; if you play around with it long enough you can get the mouse to stop flashing at you but it never sticks.  I ended up opening the mouse and just removing all the flashing LED's...THERE WERE A LOT OF THEM!  This was a large improvement as even in direct sunlight the LED's are too bright and flashy, and in the dark they were far brighter than my screen.  Note to seller: save some money and skip the LED's...you will have a better product and people won't have to do surgery and replace mouse feet to make your product acceptable.

    I purchased this mouse in January of 2020. I used it nearly every day since then and I really like it and the way that you can adjust the speed of the mouse movement. I also like the colors and the feel of the mouse on a mouse pad .Went to use it this morning and the top part of the mouse is dead although the red underneath ( used to be called a trackball when it had moving parts ) is still lit. Swapped it out for another mouse and the other mouse works fine .No surprises, though.  I am ordering another one. ( Oh I forgot to mention, I also bought one of these for work and replaced the one the company provided.)

    I really wanted to like this mouse because it is hard to find a quality mouse with proper support rests for your ring and pinky fingers.Unfortunately, while this mouse is advertised as being optical, it is not.  It is a laser mouse.  For a household with small children who like to do things such as stare at a laser up close, this is a total deal-breaker - and false advertising.Likely related to it being a laser mouse instead of optical, the lift-off distance was atrocious.  Even while trying to navigate to the Amazon return page using that mouse I almost couldn't do it because of how it kept tracking even when I lifted the mouse the full comfortable distance from my mouse pad resulting in the mouse cursor moving back and forth on the screen instead of going one direction like I intended, and like my other mice have no problem doing (however those other mice do not have proper ring and pinky rests, hence looking for a properly designed ergonomic mouse.As for the ergonomics, I imagine they are great for someone with fingers about 1-1.5 cm shorter than my own.  If I fit my hand comfortably on the mouse while holding it in the air, my ring and pinky fingers hang over the edge by over 1 cm.  If the mouse is on the mouse pad, those same fingers drag and are forced to be bent in an uncomfortable position essentially negating the otherwise nice ergonomics built into the mouse for those fingers.Another gripe is the mouse feet, or gliders, have a lot of friction and are sticky.  Both of my other mice glide fine over my mousepad, but this mouse had significant resistance that was immediately noticeable.Had to return this mouse immediately which is too bad because it looks like a great mouse, and with a few adjustments, could be so.

    The way this mouse fits an adult sized hand is crazy. They definitely put in a lot of time designing it. If you are a gamer or on the computer a lot this is the mouse for you. It's not wireless but with the lights it's a good thing so you don't have to go through all those batteries.

    I have been using this mouse since May 2018 as my daily and I thought it did the job very well until I noticed a pattern. I am currently on my second mouse whose left click either doesn't register or registers twice with one click. The same problem happened with my first mouse after ~2 years of use except it was the scroll wheel button. I didn't think of it much when I ordered a new one in 2021. It almost feels like they made this mouse so it'll last you only 2 years and then u gotta buy again. I reached out to customer support and they said they can't do anything about it.Ergonomics: For my decent sized hand, it does the job very well except there's a big distance between your middle finger resting on the right click and your ring finger resting on the side. I never got used to this despite dailying it for 5 years.I will say it has been extremely durable. I take very good care of my electronics and keep them clean and shiny.I love the RGB except there's always one tiny area in front of the forward side button where the light bulb can hit your eyes directly if you're sitting in a particular direction.I honestly used it for so long because I was ok with compromising given the affordability. However, after noticing the pattern with buttons not working after every ~2ish years of use, I might go for a different better brand.

    Great overall, Nice and fancy, Great grip. Nothing to be complaining about except for one thing. The cable is very stiff and it gets stuck alot between wall and table in hot heated gaming sessions. But with time it will surely get better.

    After purchasing this product I am very pleased with how this mouse can do anything you want with it.Pros:-Very comfortable with your hand especially the way they've designed it.-RGB options are fantastic, I like how you can make any color in any way you like it!-mouse sensitivity buttons are an actual nice feature, the way how you want to adjust is literally close to the mouse wheel.-I like how there are extra buttons on the mouse, since this is a gaming mouse it is quite useful especially when you are playing games such as; Overwatch, call of duty, fallout, and etc.Cons:-Mouse sensor sensitivity; when I am trying to adjust my hand position with the mouse usually I'm so used to adjusting it almost one inch off the service but with this mouse, it's still recognising me using it even if it's almost an inch off the service. I looked to see if I can change this from the software where I installed it from and it doesn't seem like there's any way of changing it sadly.-Installing the software and restarting the pc; After installing the software of this mouse I open the application to change the color but nothing happened it still did the same default rainbow color changing on the mouse instead of changing anything but I did try the restart pc method and it worked surprisingly. I find it a bit ridiculous that I had to restart my entire pc just to make the mouse work but I can understand why at the same time.-Mouse wheel position; when I use my middle finger to use the mouse wheel it feels a bit awkward when scrolling through my browser or playing games when selecting weapons or items, this is another minor issue but I can also overlook as well.---------------------So far that's is all I have my thoughts on this product, I highly recommend anyone buying this kind of product, and yes even with the cons I mentioned beforehand but still, I think everyone should buy this product!~B

    (DISCLAIMER: I WAS NOT PAID OR ENCOURAGED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW | THESE ARE MY TRUE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ABOUT THIS BRAND AND PRODUCT!!!)If you're buying as new PC gamer, or as long term gamer just wanting some fresh gear, know that REDRAGON is as good as Logitech, Corsair, Steel Series, Razer, ETC.Do not hesitate to buy from them!All of there products have great build quality, engaging and satisfying clicks and tactile bumps, pure RGB with an assortment of mesmerizing settings, and highly customizable universal hardware!Personally, I have owned this mouse, the GRIFFIN M602 and and YAMA K550 with a hardtop RGB mousepad all by REDGRAGON, for about 2 years now. While I personally have used and tried an assortment of every other gaming brand! REDRAGON IS AMONG THE GREATS!AS GREAT AS THE DAY I GOT IT!!!All the products have been proved to have the longevity of a high tier gaming brand!!!Clicks and Bumps and everything all still strong and working as good as ever.This mouse has by far the best click I have ever felt.Logitech is known for it's clicks and simple designs (in my opinion and some around me).And this click blows the doors off of every mouse I've touched!!!Ergonomically and wonderful design shape, but slightly heavy, BUT! that is the tier of mouse this is! This there larger ergonomic design! They do have other shapes and sizes! Don't forget about their weighted mice!REDRAGON hit the nail on the head flawlessly as a brand.The product execution is over the top perfect!!!From them being completely accessible through Amazon (my favorite shopping platform!) and to the names of the products the spots in the market there products fit in the style, the dragon logo and name, the packaging, the software, and everything about the brand and their products!!!They really know what they're doing in the gaming world TRUST them!They are not over the top by any means!A truly streamlined and brilliantly marketed brand and product(s)!They are the quiet cool step cousin that people are scared to talk to because he looks so bad ass but theyre told hes a piece of shit, and then they find out hes just as good a person as everyone else and way better than you may have thought.Great gaming feel and as well as high quality competitive tier build.REDRAGON is a very well thought out brand.

    I was initially very skeptical of this mouse given the price and what I'd heard about red dragon's software. However, upon opening the package, for a 20$ mouse I was amazed at the weight and the quality. It was well beyond what I had expected. I knew going into purchasing a mouse that I didn't need anything fancy. I'm a graphic designer who does the very rare but occasional gaming, and I didn't want to spend a ton on a mouse. I just wanted something wired, and white to match my PC case. I'm very pleased with using it thus far. There's customizable software for color and sensitivity available by search on red dragons website and the buttons on the side are not too in the way (a fear I had about bumping them during regular use) and the grip is comfortable. Also, the plastic feels much less cheap than I expected it to. I couldn't guess it was a $20 dollar mouse if I didn't buy it myself. Definitely recommend this mouse, as it's a great budget option and holds it's own.

    First off, wireless mice can kick rocks.  I don't wanna have to dock or replace batteries constantly.  That already puts this mouse at an advantage.I was pleasantly surprised when this came in the mail.  I've had Razer, Corsair, and Logitech mice in the past.  They were great until they started to conk out.  Razer is particularly bad in this aspect: quality control, value for price, and durability leave a lot to be desired.  This mouse is holding up very well so far.Instead of coming in a lazy cardboard box, you get a reusable plastic case.  Certainly not expected at the price point.The RGB pattern is beautiful and mesmerizing.  The feel of the mouse is nice.  Parts don't feel particularly premium but the usual cheap clickyness isn't there, either.  You definitely get more than you pay for.This mouse is great if you're tired of paying too much for mice that slowly die on you over time.  No, it's good period.  Really, the only bad thing I can think of is a lack of tuning software (that I know of at least).  It doesn't have good hardware acceleration but it is responsive so who cares.But let me not oversell this.  I recommend it as a solid backup option or if you simply want to complete an RGB setup.  Now, if you are hard-core competitive on MMO's or shooters, you may want to look elsewhere but, otherwise, this mouse will serve you well and justify the price.

    The mouse is generally good, but the sensitivity/color controls are strange. The top button changes both, while the bottom button just changes sensitivity. I don't want the lights in the first place, it's annoying to set them to off.

    Overall: 8/10It’s a great mouse for the price, it’s obviously an entry level gaming mouse but even if my setup was high end then I would still use this mouse because it can easily do what other more expensive gaming mice can do and I think that’s pretty much all that matters. For esports I would certainly get a better mouse but for casual gaming/productivity uses than this mouse works perfectly fine for me.Pros:•Pretty good mouse for the price, I spent a total of $15.99!•Decently weighted, didn’t feel like cheap plastic, I was surprised by how heavy it felt my first time handling it.•Colors and patterns are smooth and mesmerizing, my personal favorite is the wave as the colors seamlessly flow together.•Braided wire so it’s built to last tugs and strain.•My hand is able to comfortable grasp the mouse due to its unique shape, but everyone’s result may vary. Personally my hand is pretty small but it still fit the mouse nicely.Cons:•The software for the mouse was a bit tricky to configure. I had to download the software manually from the website and had trouble getting my presets to save/work but I figured it out after a few minutes (Run the program as admin and it should work fine!)•It’s not a dealbreaker but some spaces on the side of the mouse can cause light to shine out directly at me sometimes but it’s very very mild, shouldn’t bother you unless you’re really picky about that sort of thing.•Bit troublesome to find the right balance of DPI sometimes when using the preset button, it’s either too sensitive or too slow but that can be easily reconfigured in the downloadable software.Edit: 9/23/20Ended up returning the mouse due to the finger rests limiting me from easily picking up the mouse to move around. This was a mistake on my part since I have limited desk space so I opted to return this mouse for one without the extended finger rests on the sides. My statement still stands that this mouse is great for the price, just make sure you have enough mouse space to move around 😅

    I'm thoroughly impressed with the Redragon M620 Wired Gaming Mouse. I've had it for a bit now and I've had no issues with it. It's fast, accurate, and extremely responsive.The build quality is fantastic. It's sturdy in the hand the only thing that you might find odd is the shape of the mouse but it's easy to get used to once you start using it.The customization options are great for people who want to tailor the mouse to their specific needs. The software that you have to download once you purchase it allows you to customize the buttons, DPI settings, and RGB Lighting.Overall, I'd highly recommend this gaming mouse to anyone looking for a mouse that's reliable and performance-oriented. The price is also a bargain.

    I bought the white color and it came perfectly! My partner and I only use Reddragon mouses (probably for 5+ yrs now) so we always come back if we need another one. The only reason why I bought a new one is because the scroll wheel on my old one (the black Reddragon centrophorus) was wearing off and required a lot of additional force to make the scroll wheel register on the computer. I hope they fixed this problem with the Reddragon Griffin because these mouses do last a long time. I bought my black Reddragon Centrophorus 3 years ago for reference.Differences between Centrophorus and Griffin- Material: Cent. Has a rough texture similar to gravel which helps with my grip. Griffin is a smooth white plastic all around with raised white prints on the side assuming to aid in grip as well.- Size: As shown in my pictures Cent. is smaller, it fitted in my hand nicely enough to where I could hold the whole mouse and have my wrist on the table at the same time (you shouldn’t do this for a long time tho cuz it can strain your tendons!!). Griffin is wider and longer than Cent. I don’t have a preference, just wanted to point it out.- Color way: Cent. was usually offered in black/red with a matching cable and only red LEDs. Griffin is white w/ a black cable and rotating red/orange/pink/green/blue/purple LEDs that with settings to change the patterns on the mouse buttons itself.- Price: Cent. Was $13-15 when I bought it 3 yrs ago which was a bang for my buck as a broke college student. With the down side of the deteriorating mouse wheel which is the bane of its retirement for my setup... Griffin is pretty much double the price at $24 but I believe it’s worth it, if the scroll wheel lasts forever that is.TLDR: Griffin is neat, the effects are cool, large size could fit any hand comfortably.

    I had way too many cords and plugs on the side of my bed so I had been looking for a charging option for all of my Apple products. This charger was on a flash deal so I lucked out on getting it on sale! It is a perfect nightstand addition. It’s sleek and compact and does what it says: charges my phone, watch and AirPods all at the same time. No issues or problems from me. It even charges my phone with its case on! I do have to make sure it is firmly pressed on the charger for it charge more quickly, only thing to note. Other than that, perfect purchase!

    My old wireless charger died so I was looking for a new one. This charger had the benefit of also charging my Apple Watch at the same time. It works flawlessly and connects instantly unlike my old charger. The only downside to this charger is that it won't charge if the phone is laid horizontally (the charging point is too high) and thus can't use the nightstand mode on the phone. But it's not a hindrance since I knew that when I chose this charger. I am quite pleased with the value and performance of this charger.

    I got this charge for a cruise so I didn’t have use so many ports and take so many cords. I still use at home and it’s so easy to just set my phone and watch down and it starts charging.I will say there are some things that might not be ideal for some people. One is that you can’t charge your phone horizontally.Another thing I noticed is that if you have a case on your AirPods, you can’t charge it on. You have to take them out.Other than that, this is a great charger, it’s portable and great for the price.

This charging stand doesn’t get 5 stars because of the  physical charge port on the back. That plug is meant for apple products/airpods. I personally have beats which is apart of Apple but for whatever reason they use a different usb charge cord. Outside of that, I love how compact this stand is only taking up a couple inches, no wider than a coffee mug. My watch hangs directly & securely on the back charging & my phone charges effectively but its certainly not a fast charger..I’m also a person who loves to sleep in complete darkness so I adore the fact that the blue light that indicates it’s charging doesn’t stay on the entire time.

    I recently purchased the 3-in-1 charging station for my iPhone SE 3rd Gen, and I must say, it has surpassed all my expectations! This sleek and modern charging station has become the ultimate power hub for all my devices.Firstly, the convenience factor is through the roof. With dedicated spots for my iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods, I can charge all my essentials overnight or when I'm working at my desk without the clutter of multiple cables. The wireless charger for the iPhone is super responsive, even with a case on, and it begins charging the moment I place my phone on the stand.The design is another aspect where this charging station truly shines. Its footprint is minimal, which means it doesn't hog space on my nightstand. The black finish is elegant and complements my tech gadgets perfectly, adding a touch of sophistication to my setup.The build quality feels premium and sturdy. The charging station has a solid base that ensures stability, so I don't have to worry about my iPhone or Apple Watch tipping over. Plus, the vertical design allows for easy viewing of my phone and watch, which is great for checking notifications or the time at a glance.Charging efficiency is on point as well. My  iPhone SE 3rd Gen charges quickly, and the stand even supports my AirPods Pro with the wireless charging case. The LED indicators are subtle and not too bright, so they don't disturb my sleep at night.

    Purchased this item for my wife who just recently decided to turn in her Fitbit for an iWatch.  She has an iPhone 14, an iWatch, and a pair of AirPods 2(with lightning connector).  This charging stand works well and has the smallest footprint to charge all three at the same time.  Her iPhone is in a MagSafe phone case and begins to charge immediately upon placing it on the charger.  Her iWatch fits easily on the watch charger and does not slip off as it lays horizontally and to top it off, the the AirPods plug into the lightning plug on the back of the charger stand.  I knew she would be happy with this purchase as I have been using this same charger for my iPhone, iWatch and AirPods with excellent results for close to a year.  I use two of them one for home and one that I carry in my travel bag.

    We purchased one of these chargers for our son, who has an iPhone, Apple Watch, and Air pods. He needed more charging ability in his room, without a ton of cords. So this was perfect! In fact it was so perfect, we bought 3 more. Its super sleek design adds to our nightstand aesthetic, instead of detracting from it. We leave our phones, AirPods and watches on them overnight and it charges great! However, It does charge a little slower with three devices on it at once. But for us that hasn’t been a problem. It doesn’t take up a lot of room, so it works for many different places (nightstand, kitchen counter and desk). We are extremely happy with our chargers.

    I purchased this 3 in 1 charging station with some apprehension.  But once I started using it I have become a believer.  It's a high quality sturdy product, with a fantastic design.  It works really well to charge all three devices (iPhone, iWatch and Airpods).  Allows you to avoid multiple wires on the side table, takes minimal space and works really well.

    I really like the design of this charging station. It has a very minimal footprint, which is what I was really hoping for. I got a lightning to USB-C adapter for the earbud charging portion, since I don’t use AirPods. My earbud case stores conveniently between that adapter and the back of the phone easel when not charging. My Apple Watch charges just as well as it did on the OEM cable, but it seems like the charging for my phone is slower than other wireless chargers I’ve used. I suspect this is because the charging coil is not optimally positioned for my smaller phone (13 mini). I would love to see this same design with MagSafe charging so that each phone model would be able to line up optimally with the charging coil and also be able to charge while in landscape orientation (as is, it doesn’t charge at all when in landscape orientation).

    Use to have a power strip next to by bed with three cords and it drove me nuts looking at it all the time. Saw this and had to get it. I’ve had it for a few months now and i love it. I can charge all of my devices with only one outlet taken up and don’t need that ugly power strip anymore. I will say it isn’t the fastest charger but i go to bed around 1-2am and wake up at 8-9am and my phone, watch and airpods will all be at 100%. The only thing is i wish i was able to charge my phone horizontally to utilize the standby mode but it’s not a deal breaker i still love it. I even took it to Chicago with me and it fit in my suit case just fine!

    The iPhone Charger Station has transformed my charging experience entirely. Its lightning-fast charging speed is unparalleled, ensuring my device is always ready to go when I need it. With a sleek design and compact size, it seamlessly fits into any space, whether at home or on the go. I no longer worry about tangled cords or unreliable connections, thanks to its sturdy build and secure grip. Plus, its versatility allows for effortless charging anywhere I need it. From its reliable performance to its convenience and durability, this charger station has exceeded all my expectations.

    I use this product strictly for my watch currently, only because my phone doesn’t get a full charge while using it and sometimes overheat (could be because of my outdated phone too lol) & I also don’t have AirPods yet, so I can’t speak for that charge quality. BUT I bought this charger for its design and I use it everyday for my apple watch. It does charge my watch pretty quick btw.Update: Recently bought 2nd Gen Airpods and they charged! So AirPods and watch charge great, but I’m Still having the same issue with my phone getting hot and barely charging while using this but it could just be my outdated phone!I still recommend purchasing.

    I wondered if the 3-in-1 Charging Dock for iPhone, Wireless Charger for iPhone, and iWatch would work because I have such a small space to place it on (RV living?...enough said). I was so glad the space required was precisely what I had. The phone has to be set just right on the charger, which isn't hard to do, and the iWatch hangs solidly on its perch. The blue light lets me know that everything is placed the way it should be and charged for the day.  I highly recommend it.

    I love this all in one charger and it has a small footprint.  BUT....if you don't seat your phone just right, there is an annoying blue blinking light that lights up your bedroom.  Also, the light stays on even when seated.  i wish there was an option to turn it off.  have to cover it with tape in order to not have it brighten my room.  Other than that, it is nice to have all my electronics on one stand.

    First!  Great charging station.  Everything works as described.  But what was really impressive was the customer support I received when the package arrived damaged and was empty.  I called Amazon immediately and explained the charger was delivered but due to shipping it had been lost.  Not a problem they replaced with no charge and had a replacement in two days!!

    I use this charger (I bought 2 - nightstand and office desk) with an iPhone 15 Pro Max in an Otter Defender series case and it always makes a charging connection on the first attempt. I also use it to charge my AirPod Pros and it works flawlessly to charge both.What I have found most valuable though is that it has changed the way I use my phone because the phone is now in an upright, sturdy position for me to operate without grasping it. Its a subtle difference, but I find I prefer operating the phone without holding it, resulting in me using Siri more (go figure). I'm just reporting what has happened, not trying to explain why. I am thoroughly please with these chargers, so much so that I was compelled to purchase a second one.

    This charging stand is the absolute best!It is neat looking, even when charging all...  ear pods, watch, and phone together.  All you see is basically the phone in a vertical position.  And the bonus is...  only a single power cord to plug in.  (BTW the charging brick comes with it).  Devices charge efficiently and within a reasonable timeframe.I was so impressed with this charging station I actually bought an additional one 2 days after opening the first box.  As a gift, my son loved it.  My 3rd purchase will be going to my dear wife (she is now a convert also)No more multiple wires and charging plugins.As the headline says...  ""Get'em while you can"".  You can't go wrong with this choice!

    I purchased this charger because of its wireless charging capabilities and am extremely pleased with the performance.  The charger seems to charge my iPhone quicker than the plug in charger that I have been using.  It has the added features of charging my Apple watch as well.  There is also a function for charging Apple Earbuds which I have not used as I do not own any of these.  All three functions will work at one time as well!  I keep this charger on the nightstand when I go to bed and in the morning both my phone and watch are fully charged.  I could not be happier with this product and recommend it highly.  If you have a need for this type a product just get it!

    I thought it would be great to have my phone, watch and AirPods all on one charger.  I love the phone and watch charger but the AirPod charger is kind of a pain.  Maybe it’s because I have big hands but I can’t pull the charging case off the charging plug without knocking both the phone and watch off their charging positions.  Like I said, I think it’s a “me” problem.  I really like having all my devices in one place and having my phone standing upright so I can easily glance over at it is great.

    I was having an issue with my previous Apple Watch not charging overnight. Waking up to a dead watch was getting annoying. I searched for a new stand & came across this 3 in 1. It has been great to have less chargers. I do need to take my phone out if its case because I have a pop socket mounted on the back, but that isn’t a deal breaker for me.

    My iPhone 8+ is starting to downgrade due to its age and with Apple being predatory about trying to force people to upgrade. With that, I’ve been having some charging issues. However, the wireless charging provided with this device makes it fast and simple to charge my phone. No hassle. I was also gifted an older Apple Watch, which charges easily on this stand. I do not own AirPods, so I am not able to say what the charging for AirPods is like with this charging station, but I’m sure it works just as well as the wireless charging spots.

    On a previous charger - different brand - it seemed to give me problems in charging my Apple Watch. I'd have to keep pressing the back of the watch against the charging stand to make ""just the right contact."" With this stand, I don't have to press the back of the watch tight to begin the charge - works very well in that regard. Two things I'd recommend to make this produce even better would be to add a charging light for the watch. And though it's not super bothersome, the charging light for the phone projects onto the ceiling, creating a soft glow. It's not super bright, but if that charging light could go off after a minute or so, I think that would be a plus. It's definitely not a deal breaker, but just a suggestion.

    What I like most about this charging station is that everything is already loaded into it. I had a previous one that my iPhone 15 with an OtterBox case had to sit on specifically in order to charge. That is not an issue with this one.Also, my previous one had a spot to hang my Apple Watch but I had to run the cord from a USB adapter built-in inside to the location it sat on. That is also not the case with this one.My AirPods are able to sit in the protective case, and the charging adapter is long enough to reach it without having to take it out.I absolutely love off.

    I got this specifically for my mom who has both a iPhone 14 and an Apple Watch. She used to have a lay-flat type wireless phone charger (which itself takes up more space than this charger) plus a separate watch charger, all on a very tiny end table with other papers and pens and various work things.This charger is great. Saves her a ton of space, and both chargers seem to work just fine. We haven’t timed how fast each thing charges compared to the old chargers, but nothing is dying on her during the work day so no complaints!Side note- it doesn’t have a crazy bright light either, just a tiny blue light at the bottom that comes on while charging (but it faces the phone’s screen, not facing out) so it’s not distracting at all- bonus!

    I first bought my wife one as a gift and saw how great and compact it was!  So I purchased one for myself. This is an excellent charger which I use for both my iPhone and Apple Watch. It is compact and fits neatly on my night stand.  There are no issues with charging multiple devices at the same time. I also like the fact the phone is upright so you can tap it to see the time or turn off any alarms easily. I also like the fact there is only one cord to deal with making the whole setup neatly organized. This would be an ideal setup for the office too.

    The charger works as intended to provide battery power to Apple Watch, Air Pods and iPhones. The design of the station is sturdy and you can tell it is high-quality. It solved my problem of cable management and lack of outlets for these three devices. It looks cool, too! You will have to take the case off your phone to charge it. Another pointer is I recommend plugging this station directly into a wall for best performance. When plugged into my desk via USB, it did not receive enough power to charge my phone. Works fine when plugged into the wall or power strip.

    We didn’t need the AirPod charger part; the watch and phone chargers work perfectly )with an iPhone XR). It is so convenient having just one plug and two devices charging on the bedside table, plus it takes up less space than separate chargers. The almost vertical position of the phone on the charger allows hands free viewing. In fact, after confirming that it would work with our in-laws phones, I ordered two more as gifts. And they are just as happy as we are.

    If you're like me, iPhone, Apple Watch, air pods on your bedside table, then you know the problems with charging..... cables everywhere. Plus, my charger port on my iPhone is getting loose where half the time it doesn't even charge. Frustrated, I decided to get a magnet charger to at least hand that charging issue when I came across this little device. I do charge my watch and that another cable and I do charge my Air pods and that's another cable in another location and I always forget where I put them, so this looked like a perfect solution, and it is. I now have one device for everything. It comes with a long power cable (no cube) so you have plenty of space to move it around. I also charge my air pods there, so I always know where they are. I was traveling this week and I brought along, and it was perfect. One spot, one plug for everything. I'm actually buying another one just to keep in my carryon so I always it for traveling. I only write reviews for things that extremely disappoint me or for things that really impress me and this device impressed me and made my life so much easier.

I was annoyed by all of the different charging chords, so when I saw this all in one charger on Amazon, I decided to give it a try. It has made it so much more convenient and visually appealing to charge all of my electronics in one spot. It charges quickly and is so easy to use. I also bring it with me when I travel to use when I stay in a hotel. I am extremely pleased with my purchase!
