    This keyboard has been reliable especially since i tend to hit keys a little too hard, changing keys are a bit difficult and it comes with some key caps that aren't even on the keyboard. Other than that, it's pretty great

    It’s my first mechanical keyboard purchase and will use only for my home office work. That being said, I love the feel and sound of this keyboard. It’s fun to see the different light modes and was super easy to plug and use. Get this keyboard! It’s so cute too

    For a cheap keyboard, this thing is great. I have the old school looking one with the brown switches and out of the box it feels pretty good. The brown switches are bit mushy but at the price I really can't complain. It feels good enough and for typing I think it's great. I am going to be using this in an office setting so I needed a keyboard that didn't look like Las Vegas at night, so this fits the bill perfectly. The only real negative I can think of is that the backlight does not shine though the keys. But this keyboard is great value. Recommended.

    The keyboard is amazing! I love that they give you extra keycaps and let you choose how it looks.But for me at least, some of the keys have bad printing and one of the kick stands will fall if you push the keyboard slightly. Im pretty the kick stand is just a defect, but I think the keycaps having bad printing is most likely going to be for all the keyboards. But the sound of the stabilizers are so good! The RGB is mid but I didn't buy this keyboard expecting for the best.

    This is a lovely keyboard for the price. I wish the plue keys were brighter, they look bright blue in the product photo but are very pale IRL. I like the additional keycaps, and i like the quality of the keyboard overall. Just sad about the color discrepancy

    I loved this keyboard for the first few months. I am a casual gamer, so I didn't need anything high-end or fancy. I wanted a mechanical, aesthetic keyboard. It fit my budget and needs because the keys sounded great and it looked nice with my setup. The lighting was pretty cool too and I love typing on it. However, after about 7 months, the entire right side has stopped lighting up. I'm not sure why, but none of those keys light up anymore. Other than that, the keys still type and I've had no other issues with it.

    It feels premium and typing on it is very satisfying. It's got lots of light modes, I keep it on the one that only lights up the light under the key that's pressed.The only downside I see to the keyboard is that the backlighting doesn't pass through the keys -- the letters on the key caps don't let any light through, meaning no light passed through them either. So, if being able to see the letters on the keys in the dark is a must for you, I'd say this keyboard isn't for you. For me, it's not a problem because I don't look at the keyboard when I type, and so in the dark, once I know where my hands are (the backlighting allows a silhouette of the keys), I'm good to go from there.

    I bought this keyboard because I was on the hunt for an affordable small one that could fit in my laptop bag for classesFor the first couple of months, it was working really well without issue. But sometimes during gaming or other tasks the thing will just randomly disconnect and keep typing the last letter pressed, or in this case in game, it keeps the character moving forward. The only way to fix this is to unplug and plug it back in again.Other than that really, I have been happy with the keyboard and how quiet it is. But in the future it makes me unsure of buying from the brand because I don't know if this is just a faulty keyboard or a widespread thing.If you love tactile keyboards, this will put you right at home wherever you go!

    When I was a teenager on a tight budget just getting into computers, I would have loved to have a keyboard like this. But Ive used much better keyboard then this since then.You really get what you pay for. A cheap, generic mechanical keyboard that 'Mageegee' chose the keycaps for, and slapped their logo on. (The 'bar' with the company logo, and two indicator lights above the arrow keys is a big tell)The key switches are inconsistent, the keycaps are cheap, with bad light passthrough, it came with some extra red keycaps to customize the look, but those keycaps don't let the light through and some were for a numberpad which being a TKL, this doesn't have. The hardwired cable is kinda short at ~5 feet.Don't get me wrong though. I would take this in an instant over the rubber dome keyboards that come with your typical PC. The switches are responsive, the keys don't jam, the typing experience is overall not bad. Its just if you spend a bit more, you can find a much better keyboard.If you are just looking for a cheap spare keyboard that you won't actively hate every time you pull it out, this ain't a bad choice.

    Se nota que tiene calidad, es mi primer teclado mecánico y se siente muy bien al escribir. Lo único malo es que en las teclas que vienen para reemplazar habían unas que no sirven porque son para un teclado 100% como la tecla de suma.De resto muy buen producto lo recomiendo

    I had a really old work keyboard and I needed something faster and sleeker. I thought I would have to return it, but I LOVE it. Plugging it into my PC is wonky, it does turn off sometimes but other than that it is beautiful.

    For the price, I am impressed, I got a second one for a spare, looks like it's going to be a good while before that spare is needed.In my opinion, the typing experience is really good, playing FPS games is also good. It doesn't have some of the features of the big brand names, also doesn't have the price of them.

    I genuinely really love this keyboard the keys feel very responsive and ""clicky"" my only issue is its hard to tell which key you're pressing sometimes because the letter/symbols are really clear and difficult to see with and without the backlight. But its not a huge issue if you've spent hours playing games and have memorized where each key is.

    Keyboard looks great! I originally bought this to use at work, but it is a bit louder than I was expecting while typing. I didn't spend a lot so I didn't expect a lot. It is still a great little keyboard and I would honestly still use it at work if it didn't bug my co-workers!

    The tactile keys feel nice and the keyboard is cheaply made but seems decent for the price. No idea how long it'll last. The keyboard is backlit but the black/white version does not have transparent key symbols so if the lighting is dark enough, you won't be able to see the symbols. Lighting seems to only be white as advertised, in case you're hoping the 19 advertised lighting effects include other colors.For under $30, this is all very reasonable. If you need a keyboard to last a little while until you can afford a good one, like me, this is a decent option. If you aren't a cave-dwelling animal who hates light like me, the lack of transparent key symbols won't be an issue.

    I use this for playing games and writing emails.  It has a good feel and a satisfying click if you like that.  I have read a lot of reviews saying that people have trouble with the windows key.  If it doesn't work just press FN+WIN, this will unlock the windows key and make it usable again. There are two lights next to the logo above the arrow keys, the upper lights indicates CAPS lock and the other indicates WIN lock. Hope this helps enjoy the keyboard

    I'm not sure how this holds up compared to more expensive mechanical keyboards. This is the first mechanical keyboard that I've ever owned. It definitely has the feel of a mechanical keyboard, so whether or not you find much practicality in it, at least you're getting your money's worth. I'm a gamer, and despite how much I've seen mechanical keyboards recommended over the years for gaming, I can't say that it makes much of a difference.The lighting on the keyboard is dimmable(and can be turned off completely), and it's not too bright to be annoying in any way, even in a dark room. I honestly can't stand people who have a gaming setup that looks like some sort of lightshow.It's a 75% keyboard, meaning that it doesn't have a number pad. If you're don't have a lot of space on your desk, it's pretty useful.I saw another review mentioning how the font looks weird, and I have to agree. It also seems like the lighting doesn't evenly distribute through the keys, leaving some parts of each character having dim spots. It doesn't make much of a difference to me though, because I don't care much for keyboard lighting, but it does make you question the quality of the product.Lastly, the manual included with the product has a few spelling mistakes, indicating that whoever wrote it was not a native english speaker.

    I didn't realize that backlit meant lights under the keycaps, but the letters aren't illuminated (only around the keys, but not through the keys). Impossible to type in the dark, turning backlight off makes it much easier to type.  Otherwise it seems like a pretty nice keyboard.

    I think this is an excellent choice for a wired mechanical keyboard.  My only complaint is that the F and J keys don't have the bumps so you can locate your hands on the keyboard.  I learned that this is a trait of gaming keyboards since F and J aren't generally important for gaming.  Even so, I just bought a separate set of cheap key caps and replaced these two keys.  I do more typing than gaming so I want normal keys.  This is just a minor inconvenience.  I would buy this again.

    I honestly don't get all of the noise complaints, keyboard is great. Sound is moderate at best, no one else in my house can hear it. Keys feel smooth, and are easily changeable. For the price of this keyboard I'd buy 10 more if I needed them. 10/10 would buy again

    If you are in the market for a under $50 mechanical keyboard this is a pretty good option. Some nice RGB/LED lighting. Hot swappable keys and the keyboard comes with keycaps for you to swap out if you like.Certainly not the best keyboard on the market and it sits a little too high for me

    The keyboard itself looks great and the material feels quite nice to the touch, I bought the white and blue variant and it works pretty well so far, the only things are that the color is a lot less saturated and vibrant than the one depicted in the pictures, looking more like a blueish light gray rather than light blue most of the times, especially when the lighting in the room isn't ideal, with poor lighting you almost can't even tell the blue and white keys apart from each other, and also it is way noisier than expected, especially the spacebar for some reason, but being a budget keyboard it works pretty well and does its job just fine.

    I think the keyboard is definitely worth the $25 I spent on it. I bought it to match my new white PC build while I decide which keyboard I want to order, so it is satisfactory for temporary use. I don't like it for gaming, tbh. It's a little clunky and slow for me.One star knocked off because the 'm' key doesn't work 90% of the time! I've tried to clean/lube the switch and idk man. Just a defect I guess.I don't really care about the lighting effects, but I know some will. They have all the usual effects, but note you cannot change the color. I got the blue/white and the backlight is blue.

    So I got this keyboard as a quick replacement for my last keyboard which had a switch die, and I do not have the soldering know how so it was just more convenient to replace it. First time using a linear switch, I have to say I am a fan of this yellow switch. It's very smooth overall after using it for a few days and not too light either. I was used to a clicky blue switch previously, so the overall sound experience is arguably an improvement.I did a few modifications to make the keyboard feel and sound better, added some foam to the bottom of the case, rubber o-rings for the keycaps (double ringed the spacebar, really made a difference for that), and lastly a strange one but: masking tape applied to the bottom part of the PCB, this gives the keys like a ""poppier"" sound though I'd say things even out with the other modifications.For the money this is definitely a worthwhile option, I kind of wish it had a Hotswap PCB but that's not something you'll typically see at this price point; and if you do I heard they don't have full switch support outside of a handful of manufacturers.

    This would've been a 5 star product if it weren't for the caps lock key to be broken upon opening the package. I used one of the other color keys that the keyboard came with to replace it, now I have two esc on my keyboard. Even so, I love the colors and the feel of the one I ordered. A good mechanical keyboard for its price, the keyboard body is durable and very portable thanks to its size. The last thing I will say is that the brightness of the keyboard is the right intensity, doesn't hurt the eyes and even if I leave it on at night my eyes barely pick up the light.

    Best bang for your buck keyboard, I’m going to be switching over soon to a more expensive keyboard but after a couple months using this it really wasn’t bad at all I just have big fingers and feel the keys have a little too much give for me, but for a beginner or someone who likes a softer touch of the keys this is the perfect keyboard and they come in lots of nice colorways

    I replace my old full size keyboard with this one and I am very satisfied with the product. It is small enough to fit on my table but has all the keys I need for gaming. I have not noticed any ghosting so far. It also comes with spare keys which is a plus.

    [black/white/orange keycaps, brown switches]Update:  No problems after 70 days usage.  At this price level, it's a very good starter mechanical keyboard, or a fun gift for someone who appreciates computer peripherals.Good deal for the price (~25 bucks, on sale).  A good to very good starter mechanical keyboard. Keys feel nice enough. 5 stars compared to other mechanical keyboards at this price level (under $30), or 4 stars compared to slightly better quality keyboards costing $40 to 60.This cheap mechanical keyboard is as good as _some_ more expensive ones I've used. If you are looking for best 'bang for your buck', or a starter mech keyboard for a youngster, then Magegee's offerings are usually a good place to look.Notes:Not quite as pictured. Comes with black and white keycaps ONLY attached (no orange ones attached). The few included orange keycaps come in a plastic bag. Also included is the cheapest possible (but functional) plastic key puller. Keys are easy to swap.Works fine for a keyboard at this price level. No bad keys after 1 week use  (update:  no problems after 70 days).Would we buy again?  At this price (sub 25 bucks):  YES.A removable USB cord should've been a feature here, but it's not. The USB cord is permanently attached, which we knew before purchasing -- so no points deduction, in spite of the seller cheaping out on a 17-cents feature.

    I am a bit hard on my equipment. But I’d say pretty confidently that I didn’t have any spills or accidents around the keyboard.After a couple months of use…“T” key started missing punches and I  tried taking it out and dusting out the switch. Still no luck. Currently collecting dust in my closet :(Don’t think I’ll be buying another.

    This review is for the ""MageGee 75% Mechanical Gaming Keyboard with Blue Switch, LED Blue Backlit Keyboard, 87 Keys Compact TKL Wired Computer Keyboard for Windows Laptop PC Gamer - Grey/Black"". I mainly program on the computer I got this for. I'm not young and have had buckling spring, membrane, scissor and the occasional mechanical. This is definitely a mechanical and these are definitely blue switches. If you're not familiar with them they're the loud clicky ones really good for typing. If you're a kid or gaming, get reds, not these. Otherwise they will seem really loud. Build quality is excellent and sturdy. Was relieved it doesn't have red keycaps on as I dont like the look. I was extremely partial to the old IBM keyboards, but the re-releases go for 150$. This is ballpark and having to pay 25$ on sale was pretty nice. Its 14"" across with no numpad which is a pretty good space saver and the key backlighting is there without being overpowering.
