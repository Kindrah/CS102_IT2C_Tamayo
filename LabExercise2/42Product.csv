    I love how quiet, yet tactile the the keys feel. I am a developer and it's probably not the best keyboard you can find on the market, but it's honestly pretty nice. I like the RGB colors. The software doesn't work with M1 Mac, but I was able to change the color with openRGB. I would definitely buy another one.Only knock is it feels kinda plasticky, cheap, but it's to be expected for the price range. It fits my purpose however, I am a happy customer.

    First off this is Steel Series so I already rock their headsets. This keyboard is amazing for the price. The key clicks are quiet and feel very responsive. The keyboard itself does NOT feel cheap. If for some reason my current one stopped working I would definitely buy another one. Great value from Steel Series

    I bought this keyboard and used it for a few months. Here are my thoughts. While the keyboard feels very nice at first, membrane switches tend to wear over time, causing the quality to worsen over a few months noticeably. The same can be said for the keycaps, made of cheap plastic, causing them to absorb finger grease over time. While I was impressed with it at first, I replaced it over the course of a few months. Instead, I would recommend getting a mechanical keyboard. Those tend to last much longer. (I upgraded to the Keychron v3, which I am now satisfied with.)Pros:-Great RGB, customizable with software-Quiet switches-Looks coolCons:-Switches and keycaps wear out quickly, causing the quality to worsen-Doesn't last!Verdict:7/10For the price, you get what you pay for. It gets the job done.

    I am a $20 keyboard kind of guy I feel a keyboard should be cheap in price and good in quality, however, this little keyboard feels so smooth for typing that as I type this review I am more and more happy that I bought it.  WOW, this thing feels amazing your fingertips just fit the keys so well and the spacing of the keys is just perfect.  I recommend this for the price point it is and I will probably be picking up a few more for gifts this year.  Terrific job Steel Series.

    As many before me, I crashed my great lighted KB which I had loved for 4 or 5 years. It was always doing great till one day it died! There are many things in reference to computers that can be hair-pulling, but loss of the KB ranks right up there, especially if you have no replacement to grab! I didn't, and I hate the virtual KB available in Windows.I am not a gamer, just a slow typist and need those lighted keys! OK, here is my likes: 1) The absolutely stunning lighted base and each lighted key! Great night light to find my way to the head in the middle of the night! 2) The keys are over-sized a bit (shaky fingers) and the letters are large and exceptionally  legible. 3) Tactile feedback reminds me of the old IBM clickable keys, which I really loved, not being a touch-typist.I purchased this one in May of '22 and was so happy using it that I purchased a second as a spare, as I damn sure don't want to have to use the virtual KB again!This KB feels like it is well-made and with the revolving (brightness adjustable) colors is kinda' neat. Oh, I am 76 years old and I've not played a lot of games. The only ones I recall are Star Trek (with asterisks launched) to shoot down Klingons, Mission Command, and those great text-based D&D-type text adventurer games, so this one is great for what I need!Hopefully my Apex 3 TKL RGB KB and I  can last beyond 80, but if one of us doesn't, I'll have a spare for my kids (53 & 46)!Thanks to  the manufacturer for a fine product!Alan Arnold

    As soon as I plugged this keyboard into my IMac M1 2021 desktop computer, a message showed on screen that it did not recognize the keyboard and all I had to do was do two things when it asked me to. Sync shift to the UP arrow under the caps lock arrow on this Keyboard and the ctrl key as well if I am remembering correctly. Typing has that old school keyboard sound and the lights are bright but in a satisfying way. Amazing work around low price keyboard for mac. I would recommend this to many!

    Pros:- The RGB is very nice and bright- Can customize the RGB to an extent using the Steelseries GG software- The additional wheel and button on the keyboard are both very useful, sadly I chose to look for a smaller keyboard and life has become Win+A.- Turn on the Air Conditioner and put on your headset (mine doesn't have ANC) and you will not hear the keys, but you surely will feel them well enough.Cons:- The RGB is not per key, this limits the customizability of the keyboard.- Is 50% louder in the morning.- Is wired (Yes, I'm that kind of person)Opinion:I live in NYC, there is no space for wires, buy it if you don't mind wires and don't care too much about customizability of RGB. I think it's worth the price.

    The first keyboard I received the ""Q"" key didn't work.  I returned it, ordered a new one the second keyboard worked.The numbers are on top of the special keys.  They work the way the should. But, 2 is on top and @ is on the bottom of the printed key.  However shift 2 gives you the @ symbol. Since I'm a touch typest, I didn't notice this for several days.My biggest complaint is that there isn't a keylock indicator. Trying to log in, entering the password, web sights kept saying I had the wrong password.  OK, the keylock was on:-(

    I LOVED everything about this keyboard. Feel, sound, size, shape, look, except.. having to keep the software installed for anything other than cascading rainbow lighting. You can change it, with the software, easily. Don't start the software, back to default cascading. It just needs one static, non-rainbow default color scheme out of the box.Ultimately, I returned it for something almost identical but with persistent memory of color settings without the software running. It was a shame to have to do so.

    I love using this with my media PC. I know it's not wireless but try gaming on a large LG OLED with a unlit wireless keyboard. Get a USB extension cord if you need. The keyboard is great in your lap or on the arm of your recliner. I use wireless mouse and this. I started gaming in the 90s so at 64 I appreciate a easy to read durable smaller line-up keyboard. Grouchy Boomer approved.

    Small and soft. I hate the number pad so I like this. Glows in the dark. Immediately. Automatically. Good price. Love it so far day one. Only thing I will say is - it's difficult to figure out how to screenshot. I still don't know how to screenshot right now. Regardless I will still give it a 5 star rating. I would give it a 4.9 review if I could. But I won't because that makes me sound like a salty boomer. Heh.

    This keyboard works great. I wanted a quiet keyboard with decent tactile feedback for gaming at night. I expected WAY less than this and figured id only use it when I don't want to anger the wife. Turns out that it feels good enough to use full time. I was also interested in the waterproofing because my damn cats always knock cups over.I will say that using a mechanical keyboard is better for typing if used *properly*. But let me tell you, 99/100 of you use them incorrectly to type and 100% of you use them incorrectly to game on. The entire benefit of a mechanical keyboard is that the actuation happens on a partial press where you do not need to bottom out the key....but I have NEVER seen someone gaming not bottom out the keys when spamming. Ever. All my friends, all streamers, everyone uses them like a typical membrane keyboard and just full sends every press. SLAM SLAM SLAM. So you may as well just use this keyboard and make 1/4 the noise at 1/4 the price and slamming these feels very similar to slamming a brown switch.If you are actually aware of how to use a mechanical keyboard for typing 120+ wpm and type a lot then it would probably be a good idea to keep one around. But I am a very picky typist and can peak at about 145 wpm and have no issues.Waterproofness - Id call it water resistant...even their website kinda hints at this. I had a cat knock over black coffee on it so I thought id test out the waterproof claims and took it to the sink and just blasted the entire thing with the shower head setting on the sink with the keycaps still on it. I really gave it the business. I shook it as dry as I could, dried it with a towel and it still works but now one of the led zones colors don't match up anymore. Keys still work fine though. So it will protect against spills but I wouldn't toss it into the dishwasher.

    Pros: My favorite keyboard for a clicky feel without the bone-jarring clack of a true mechanical keyboard. I prefer the TKL version because my right hand doesn't have to travel as far to reach the mouse. Cons: Have to install the branded software to change the backlighting. If you are happy with slowly changing rainbow backlighting, the software is not necessary, but I find the changing light distracting. So in order to get constant backlighting I tolerate the software, which seems to exist mostly to advertise the company's other products. Now and then the keyboard loses its backlighting settings and reverts to the default changing pattern, so I have to restart the software and set the backlighting again. But I love the keyboard so much that it's worth this annoyance.

    Bought this originally to replace a longer 10-key keyboard. It is awesome! The RGB effects are really cool and easy to switch, and the keys are loud and clacky like other 10-keyless mechanical keyboards out there. The keys feel smooth and easy to press. Love this keyboard, would highly recommend.

    One of the top featured reviews has many false claims about this keyboard, some drawbacks for sure but it has very good value for the price:- The software SteelSeries GG is required for changing RGB colors and key layout, but you are NOT required to create an account. Just hit skip when opening the software up for the first time and go to Engine to change settings.- The software is REQUIRED to run in the background for your settings to stick. It won't close out completely until you right click the taskbar icon -> Exit. It won't take up much resource so I wouldn't worry much.- There are macro key numbers labeled (M1-M6) but you cannot assign macro functions to an existing key without it losing its original value (For example, if you assign a macro to the DEL key, it won't delete anymore even if the SteelSeries key held down or not).- Dedicated SteelSeries Function key can only be used to change light mode and increase/decrease keyboard brightness level.- Keys are very quiet and decently tactile. You definitely won't type as fast compared to a mechanical keyboard but this is good for office work and gaming. - Build quality is very nice for the price, it is (I believe) plastic but very sturdy and high quality while not being too heavy.

    I didn’t want to spend a lot on a keyboard. I usually replace them every few years. I went with steel-series because I have some of their products (Arctis 7 headset, mousepad) and they are all high quality. To no surprise this keyboard is also high quality. You won’t be disappointed.

    Not that quiet, just typical membrane with keys that don't wobble for less noise. Software is required for lighting if you don't want it just color shifting all day which is ugly.Why can't I pick preset colors without the bloated software? My merc stealth from 15 years ago did it with, no software.Keyboard is well built, feels sturdy. Next one will not be a steelseries unless I can pick the lighting color (within reason) without software.

    I got this as a budget 10-keyless to give me more mouse room for FPS. I've owned 200 dollar keyboards and I've owned 5 dollar keyboards. The quality of this board was surprising to say the least. The key response feels good and the build quality feels excellent down to the rubberized stands.

    I prefer my cheap keyboard that I gave to my girlfriend.  I got this thinking it would be quiet, capable of a solid red display and had a volume knob.  It is smooth for typing.  Quieter than my previous keyboard, not as quiet as I had hoped.  I like the volume knob.  My primary requirement was a keyboard I could set to all red so I can get to sleep at night.  My last keyboard managed this manually on the keyboard without special software, and never forgot to stay red.  This keyboard required an app that runs in the background demanding attention and updates.  Even with the app running, the keyboard forgets my instruction and only preference setting for all red, and goes all color changing all night.  The keyboard once set, should not require further instruction.  My cheaper keyboard followed my instructions.  I'll probably throw this one out.

    Bought this for some more mouse wiggle room when playing pc games, and it did not dissappoint.  Had it just over a day now, and while its not ""whisper quiet"", its not obnoxiously loud.  The RGB is great and can sync with my Arctis 5 headset, so thats neat.  I'm a happy gamer dad.

    Paired this with my son's Series S setup.  The keystrokes are nice and soft, and doesn't make a lot of noise like the mechanical keyboards.

    First of all Its a membrane not mechanical (i bought it by mistake) but it have a good feel to every keystroke like a dell US SK-8115 - NM467 (that keyboard has an amazing feel but this steel series is way better) , second i has a multimedia multi funtion button with a scroll for volume and mute. I like the fact that i can type for hours with not having any disconfort. I have month using it and still love even tho i cant play osu and apex to a good level with it because is not perfect for fast and precise key pressed like circle streams in osu and technical maps or super glide in apex and movement techniques (you can do it but will not always work as you want or need). I must say its actually a good keyboard overall and call it again its membrane with good feel. if you can buy the mechanical version i think i can do the trick.

    This seemed like a good choice as an illuminated keyboard for astronomy at night. Can't find anything to gripe about concerning the hardware, but REALLY... a 300MB download just so I can change colors? What's worse, the software is full of gaming BS and you need yet another account to actually set anything up, or just live with the rainbow lighting wave if you don't. At least the default out-of-the box could be something less distracting.  It took me an hour of fiddling around with the software to figure out how to get a nice subdued red color because the manual is worthless. It provides a little bit of info that becomes obvious 5 minutes after opening the box. However, it does see fit to translate everything into many other languages! Likewise, the website's ""help"" is just a bunch of Q&A. C'mon Steel Series...you should have considered this product would be used by someone other than a gamer and provide enough info to help someone set up the software. Or is there some obscure key combination that renders your bloatware unnecessary? You almost got this keyboard back.

    my normal keyboard is a g pro tkl, though i decided to try this one out as the g pro is very clicky and noisy. i love how quiet and smooth the typing experience is, and it plays great in games. there is something that puts me off of this keyboard, and that's the fact that the caps lock indicator is obscured by the macro keys. i would suggest moving the light indicator an inch or so higher so the user can see if caps lock is on without having to lean over their keyboard all the time

    i love this keyboard, it small and better then the apex 100 i have but one of the biggest problems i have with it is that it dose not have a polling rate, i really need to polling rate on this keyboard because i want to change it to 500hz or 1000hz and the reason being is because i play on a laptop and the more hz you have the better response time but at the cost of your cpu and i don’t have a good laptop so i really want steelseries to put a polling rate if they and or tell me how many polling rate it has to know what i’m working with. Otherwise this is probably the best budget keyboard every and even the apex100 is a really good budget keyboard but only thing i don’t like about it is that i can’t change the rgd but it has a polling rate which i did change a lot. so steelseries if you ever see this can you please tell me how many hz it has or if there ever going to be a polling rate for this.

    I got this keyboard to replace my RedDragon K552 keyboard that started to have different keys failing after a year.  This keyboard has a soft quiet key unlike a Razor or Roccat.  People used to tell me to mute on a conference call because they can hear me typing.  With this keyboard, I did not get that when I was un-mute.  I decide to give this to my son for his gaming as this is a shorter keyboard thereby giving him more space for his mouse.Pros:- Smaller Keyboard if you have limited desktop space (TKL)- Very quiet keys- Decent gaming keyboard (Will have to see as time goes)- Reasonable priced.Cons:- Key cap feels too plastic for me- Keystrokes too quiet for meI did not use for gaming so cannot comment on the application to control the keyboard.

    I bought the full keyboard version for primary setup, and 10 keyless version for travel. It fits nicely in my backpack. Very nice key feel.

    I love this keyboard. Good quality, the clicks are not too loud, but still have that clicky satisfying sound and feeling. The only downside is that the keys don't change color when pressed, but otherwise it's cute! Love the availability to change the patterns and colors. I use it with a macbook air, so it's compatible!

    The product is good for the price but the only thing that’s annoying is when I set it to be set to one color, some sections of the keyboard would turn green or white or blue when it’s set to red and once the entire keyboard turned different colors. But other than that it’s a good keyboard for $40

    Love this keyboard. It's my first keyboard and it's very functional. The colors are really nice and honestly it's not distracting at all since I'm not staring at my keyboard while typing. It looks pretty cool and safe to say it's durable. It's also fun to press on the keys and it's not super loud.

    REMEMBER, THE KEYBOARD WILL NOT WORK IF YOU DO NOT UPDATE IT REGULARLY. IF IT STOPS WORKING REMEMBER IT NEEEDS AN UPDATE AND IS NOT BROKEN.

    Light up computer accessories are an absolute must have for me. Not only does it make my desk look slick and awesome but it helps make the keys easier to see. The lighting is pretty bad where I have my desk set up but it helps make the rainbow glow even prettier.

    For a cheap steel series keyboard it is a great option for someone who doesn’t want to spend 200$ on a higher end keyboard, it is confortable and most importantly it works well. I even got the cheapest steel series wireless mouse with it to and they both together look great on my desk, and work fantastic. I would definitely recommend getting this.

    This keyboard has nice spring loaded feel.  Kids love the LED lights and the faster response versus the wireless keyboard they were using.

    The Apex 3 TKL is a decent functioning membrane keyboard that is RGB backlit. The software was easy to download, install and get the backlighting working. When the computer goes to sleep, or is turned off, and then turned back on, the software doesn't resend the lighting command, leaving a working keyboard without any backlighting that is not easy to see the keys. I have had to open the software and  change the lighting zone color to get the backlight to work again, but for that zone. After repeating for each zone, I finally have a lit keyboard again. My corsair 60% keyboard lights back up without trouble when pressing a key to come out of sleep mode or when I reboot of the computer. The Steel Series engine software lets what should be a decent entry level TKL keyboard down.
