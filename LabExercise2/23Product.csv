    It doesn't work very well at low zoom, but works great at high zooms. Took a picture of the sun and picked up sun spots.

    The Smartphone Solar Imaging Enhancing Photo Lens exceeded my expectations with its remarkable ability to enhance solar images captured on my phone. Its innovative design effectively filters out excess light, resulting in clearer and more detailed photos of the sun's surface and solar phenomena. This lens is a must-have for any amateur astronomer or enthusiast looking to capture stunning solar images with their smartphone.

    Works very well. You cam state directly at sun, or take pics and video of the sun with thus little item. Nothing fancy but does the trick

    They say to hold it with your finger while taking the picture. MEH, I just used some blue painters tape and stuck it to the Iphone. Now I can pinch and zoom with no issues and it doesn't fumble around or come off, until I want it to.It really works and I can't wait for the eclipse. Also, you should try and take pictures of the sun before the eclipse. Now is the time to figure it out, not then.

    I just tested this filter out and my images are very distorted. Unfortunately, this did not work for my phone. I have a Google Pixel 7.

    This photo lens looks cheap, but it wasn't.  I think it is highly overpriced. I bought it to use when the Solar Eclipse happens, but don't know if I will know how to use it. Hope the viewing glasses are better when they arrive.

    I purchased this this past fall prior to the eclipse in October. I used October as my test run for April. I got great pictures from my phone using this. I recommend this to friends.

    Simple to use, just hold it in front of the camera lens and it blocks out all light.

    I put it against my phoneâ€™s camera lens. It took out the glare on a full sun day.The only drawback is you will have to make an adapter to hold it on your phone. Tape would work.

    So I used my iPhone to take these pictures while I was at a solar astronomy event at a museum showing people the Sun with my solar telescope. I did some cropping and used the built in iPhone editing tools.

    Using this, I found it hard to steady / aim this and the camera in opposite hands.  That's not the mfgr / vendor's fault, to be sure.Best images were with this sitting about 6"" or so from the camera lens.  But my own ratio of bad <> good pics was about 6:1.  Again, not their fault, I suppose.Although the instructions state not to use it with your eyes to view the sun directly, I did use it that way, and found image quality a bit better than some disposable eclipse glasses I had for the 2017 event.For the price, I'd buy this again.  Didn't damage mine, so I can use it again in April, as a backup ('eclipse-safe' film lasts about 3yrs, before replacement is recommended).

    The device works as advertised and produced nice images.  However, it does not attach to your cell phone.  You either have to hold it against your phone with one hand, or find a rubber band.  Of course, you then have to find a way to point it to the Sun and avoid eye injury.It works with my 35 mm camera, too, but has to be held in front of the lens with one hand.

    Itâ€™s a piece of cardboard with a filter but it works. I used it for the annular eclipse and got good pictures. It still seems pricey at $8 but again, it worked.

    It's inexpensive but the filter works really well. The sunspot even shows up great, and I rotated the filter to make sure it wasn't a flaw. Can't wait for April's eclipse!

    This is a thick piece of paper and some film like that of the disposable eclipse glasses. Iâ€™m sure that it would be more economical to use the glasses as you can purchase a dozen for the same price.

    To large and clumsy for cell phone use. Good of your a large camera dsl user or large camera lens use.

    You will need a solar filter. This item will do the job without damaging your phone's camera sensors. This especially true if you are like me planning to take photos or videos of the Sun during the next solar eclipse before and after totality.

    This was the first picture I took using the filter. I used my Samsung S21 Ultra (so three generations old) zoomed in to 4x. The line through the pic is a power line.

    I purchased this and one other product because of the 2024 Solar Eclipse coming to our area in April. Since receiving it I have used it with both my Nikon SLR and my Samsung S23 Ultra phone and it has worked better than expected. Cannot wait for the Eclipse.

    The pictures taken of the recent eclipse with this photo lens and my Iphone were not as affective as desired. I will say that the sky was a little cloudy and this may have had an impact on the overall photo quality. My results were somewhat disappointing.

    You have to hold it against your phone (or maybe tape it to the phone), but you can definitely get pictures of the sun. You probably won't see sun spots, but it does work.

"33","Smartphone Solar Imaging Enhancing Photo Lens","Amazon Customer","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2024","







  
  
    While it filtered the sun for some O.K. pictures, it really couldn't help with most pictures of the sun.  Most of the photos made the sun seem oval-shaped.  I could see sun spots with my eyes through filtered glasses, but I was unable to capture that with my Samsung S23 Ultra.  It is also very difficult to hold this filter in place while taking a picture.  I recommend spending a bit more money for a higher quality filter.

    I bought this well in advance of the April 2024 annular eclipse.  I tested on a sunny day and the lens does filter the light of the sun to where it can be photographed.  If you take a lot of digital photos,  this is worth having.

    It does exactly what I expected.  I haven't played with exposure, iso or any other pro mode camera settings yet. You can probably get a better shot if you make adjustments. I just put it over my lens and zoomed in with a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.  Pretty cool.  Your phone definitely matters.  Zoom capabilities are a problem for iPhone users.  I compared it to my friends iPhone 14 pro and his pictures were trash.  I feel like the bad reviews are just iSheep not having the ability to zoom like a Samsung can.

    Bottom line is you need an old phone or a very new phone.  My Pixel 4 cannot focus since it uses the cameras to focus.  You need a single-camera phone or an advanced top-of-the-line phone that is smart enough.

It was alright. Shot on an iPhone 13 pro-Max, not a professional at all. We ended up with many glasses at the end of the day, and so many other people ended up taping the glasses to their phones.
