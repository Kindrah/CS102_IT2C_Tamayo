    Been sitting on a Respawn gaming chair now for a few years, it was like sitting on plywood at that point. I'd been shopping around for a bit, off and on, for another chair. Kinda didn't want to give up a limb for a decent chair, but it seems those days are gone (the respawn chair cost 125-ish).So after a bit of looking around, I decided to choose this chair. Now, I didn't choose this chair for the bluetooth speakers (I literally didn't realize it had any until after the fact), I chose it for the lumbar support and the color.Fast forward to this past Saturday, and I had it assembled. Took about an hour, and the pictograms didn't help all that much. Pretty intuitive though, just had to make sure you had the right bolts. Do yourself a favor and have a cordless drill with a hex head onhand for running them in, and hand tighten for the finishing touch. Once that was all done, I sat down and was pleasantly surprised to find it was firm, but flexible. I'm sure though in a couple years it'll wear out but for now, win!So, next step since at that point I realized it had bt speakers, was to TRY to get windows to sync with it AND my desktop setup. Yeah that didn't work out so well. Windows sees the speakers, but it won't allow the mixer to sync with the desk ones. I have zero clue as to why. Went on YT and all kinds of forums for an answer, and walkthroughs... Nadda. Just doesn't work on my rig. But since i'm running 5.1 surround, its not a HUUUGE deal. This chair would be perfect for someone with a laptop, or console, or just needing speakers. My phone found the speakers as well, so it's phone supported.Now the speakers aren't super good. And if you want that kind of sound quality, pop them out and replace them with alpine, klipsch, etc etc and go with that. But they aren't terrible either. They're in my opinion a mid range quality speaker. Helpful tip: they run off their own power supply, and have 2.5mm jacks to plug into. Recharging is done via usb-c, and takes about 1.5hrs to fully charge it. I have no idea how long the battery lasts, but given the size of the battery box, and weight, i'd say not too long.So, the best redeeming quality I found was in fact, the comfort. I've sat in this now for 2+hrs and have fallen asleep. This isn't me being tired or whatnot, it's just that its surprisingly comfortable. First time, I reclined in it while listening to some Low Roar, and was gone within the hour. Had the back portion reclined, no footrest extended. Woke up 2hrs later, wasn't kinked up or anything. Second time, I had it slightly reclined, and was just reading emails on my phone and off I went again. About 2hrs later I wake up, back still doing ok. Still didn't use the footrest. At some point in time, I gotta try that part out, If I can stay awake long enough lol.So i'm going to say, its worth the $ if you want something like this but don't want to spend a mortgage on a high quality seat. It's comfy, doesn't take forever to construct, has built in speakers that aren't terrible, and the quality is there. So, what're you waiting for? Buy with confidence!

    Without a doubt it is comfortable and looks great, once it is assembled.  The assembly instructions not so simple though. Although I assembled it by myself after half a day's work, but I am 90 years old and not so easy getting around.  Some of the metal (prethreaded) screw holes were not properly aligned and one even had damaged threads which made it even more difficult. Be prepared to have a few extra tools to help and some thread tape to put on some of the screws to get a better trheaded connection if you want a good fit.  a battery powered drill is also very helpful.  Also watch the assembly videos on Youtube. The directions leave a lot to be desired. For instance, I had the most problems with the foot rest and the arm rest due to screw and screw hole problems, and the directions are incomplete. Directions say (with not so clear drawings)  ""Install the mechanism and foot rest rails"" that's it for those items! which could use better explanation on the 'How and Where' part of it since the diagram is poor.  That's why the lower rating from me.  Would I buy it again?.  Yes, because now I know how to assemble it! But I would willingly have paid extra if it came assembled.  NOTE:  When you ever see a message on any assembly that says ""DO NOT Tighten The screws completly until they are all fixed in the correct position""... That means one thing, Always!........That the screw holes may NOT be properly aligned.  You will see that message in several places, and you will see what I mean.

    First, I love that the color looks exactly like the image. I love that I can listen to music right through the chair itself. It was super easy to assemble. the pillows are comfortable. I will say the strap for the headrest one broke pretty quickly, but that was an easy sew fix. Speaker quality isn't surround sound or anything special, but its still a neat feature to have. I do spend most of my down time in this chair and it is very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.

    This chair is beautifully made! I got it because I work from home and I needed a comfortable chair to sit in for 8+ hours. This chair definitely delivers in the comfort area!It wasn’t super difficult to put together. The most difficult part for me was attaching the seat to the connector. Also I did have a hard time putting one of the arm rests together. But nothing a little elbow grease couldn’t take care of.Other than that, set up was easy. The chair is super comfortable!The one drawback for me is the foot rest. It’s hard to pull out and even harder to put back in. There is no release mechanism so you do have to use some strength to take it out and put it away. I’m assuming it’s just cus it’s new though, so may get better with time.Also I wish that I had the option to lift and lower the foot rest at different angles because sometimes I don’t want my legs stretched out.Also the material needs to be wiped down frequently. It gets dirty quickly.Aside from those gripes, the lumbar support is great. My back no longer hurts me.The chair moves very easily. A little to easily. I had to put a rug underneath it but that’s because I have wooden floors.I have yet to test out the speakers but I’ll get to it one day.For now, the chair is amazing and is serving its purpose wonderfully.

    Very nice office chair  great speakers sound quality is good bluetooth signal cuts in a d out  once in awhile  but  it's an easy troubleshoot  the receiver just needs to get valcroed under  my desk for a better signal which I'll do once I get into my bedroom of the house with my desk. Other than that it's a beautiful comfy chair and the sound quality is awesome.

    I bought this as a gift for my fiancé for Christmas. He loves to play call of duty on his Xbox, just like every other dude. I wanted to get him a gaming chair that was still aesthetically pleasing. Our den/game room is the first thing you see when you enter our home so it was important to have a neutral color chair. The color is perfect however the quality is not. Both the arms have broken off within the first month of him using it. When you try to reattach them or tighten them so they don’t break off, there’s no resistance to hold it in place. Like the threading in the plastic isn’t there for the screw to grab onto, if that makes sense. He still likes it though and says it’s comfy.

    This chair is amazing, assembly is super easy and lots of spare parts just in case.assembly booklet was pretty easy to understand.everything arrived in perfect condition via FedEx.I have tried many chairs and to me this one get all 5 stars.as for the padding on the bottom and sides is excellent, this is not a soft chair like some in the market, so makes it even better however is up to the user, some prefer soft, super soft or firm. to me this one is perfectly firm.Speakers on the back are ok, wish it had something a bit better but i do have a digital sound system for my games so no biggie.

    Simply, it was very easy to put together, Bluetooth works incredibly, so far it’s not as plush as what the product image shows but actually still pretty comfortable. Naturally since it’s brand new, it’s a little solid because it needs to be broken in but after a few days of some excessive gaming time, I’m sure it’ll adjust very well to my body. Everything is in great quality, material smells nice (weird I know but I love the smell of new things), recline with foot rest is probably a little dangerous because I know I’m gonna fall asleep in this thing. Overall I’m incredibly impressed. I’ll come back to this if anything changes after some time has passed. (Oh note I should add I’m 5 ft 1 and it fits me really well, probably not suitable for tall people)

    What I did like was the Style of the chair. It's not your run of the mill color scheme for gamers. It was very comfortable. What I did not like, was one of the screws for the wheel base would not go in all the way. The major drawback for me, was the seat was bobbling up and down because the platform mechanism the seat sits on did not have an extra crossbar added. So I had to add several strips of heavy duty velcro to keep the seat still. And also, the cats that hide the bolts and the tube that hides the gas lift should have been a harder plastic. These were very flimsy. If these were updated with these problematic features, it would be the perfect chair.

    My friend purchased this chair last year and had recommended it to me. I have a full time remote job that I started a few months ago and my previous chair was not helping me. My back pain and hip pain was getting worse. Too many hours in a seated position is not ideal. I decided to bite the bullet and purchase this chair and it has been life changing. The support of this chair was felt immediately. The pain I felt in my back, neck and hips lessened. Proper support made all the difference! . I highly recommend you invest in yourself. This is worth it. The chair also has a foot rest so I can stretch out and leans back as well. These are just bonuses. I have not utilized the speakers yet. We will be ordering this for my husband next.

    This is a good chair , looks exactly as pictured. The only things are it arrives completely disassembled so get your tools out because the tiny ones take a while to use. And the other thing is it is a little squeaky when leaning back not super crazy but sometimes it is loud and catches you off guard haha. Looks lovely. Comfy.

    This chair is great. It’s comfortable & sturdy. The speakers are a nice feature. The seat is a little stiff but might soften with use. The foot rest is convenient but isn't top quality. Still overall i like the chair & for the price it’s worth it.When I received the package one of the arm rests was broken during transport. I contacted the manufacturer with an email. They asked for some photos & receipt. Once confirmed they immediately sent out a replacement & informed me that the parts are warranted for 1 year. The punctual response & warranty made this a 5 star purchase.

    The chair came in faster than when it said it would be, opened the box and everything was there and it was super easy to follow the instructions and put it together! They proved everything for you, you don't need any other tools. It's super comfy and fits his office perfectly. Will definitely recommend!!

    I’ve had this chair for a couple months and I love it.  It remains comfortable through a full work day when I’m working remotely.  I’m 6’2” and 220 lbs and the chair feels very solid and well-built.  The built-in speakers are surprisingly decent and the rechargeable Bluetooth module has a remarkable battery life, still indicating a 75%+ charge after long gaming sessions.For an adult my size, the leg rest is small and feels like I’d end up damaging it, but my kids love using it.  The recline feature is also nice as you can adjust it to the exact position you want then lock it in-place, versus typical desk chairs that either tilt back all the way or don’t tilt at all when locked.Overall, I would definitely recommend this chair and I feel it would still be an excellent value at a higher price.

    My new home came with a built-in desk and a BIG suede office chair, that left a 5""‐6"" gap between the chair and my back, and arm rests outside of my elbows. The previous owner was an over 6' tall older man and I am a 5'1"" female.On a tight budget, I searched to find an affordable cat-proof ( =non fabric) light-colored chair that looked good, fits me, and supported my low back and arms at the right height.This chair, designed for teen gamers <5'9"" who spend hours in a chair, met all that.It was easy to assemble.Only complaint is that the back pillow needed velcro strips at each end to hold it up in the small of my back; I was suprised it didnt come with them.  Once those were added, it was perfect.The built-in speakers are a nice bonus and beats wearing those annoying pods in my ears.

    My biggest issue was the hardware kit was missing 2 screws. The kit had the count on it and said that much. The manual said the correct number. The good thing was they were a  common screw and locally available. Chair is sturdy and comfortable. Comes with built-in speakers that face away from the occupant and toward anyone else in the room. Might have been 4 without the hardware shortage and 5 if the speakers made sense. There is good enough potential I would buy again, so not too bad.

    So far I love this chair it’s very comfortable and was easy to put together the Bluetooth speakers are pretty decent and material of the chair is nice and it looks just like the one in the picture. Only issue I have with it is the foot rest is really weak and feels like if you put to much pressure on it it will bend or snap you don’t get much support at all from it which is like that with most of these chairs at this price range. Also I read people were having problems putting on the arm rest that it would get stripped while screwing them in and I thought this happened to me but then I noticed the washer was in the way you have to make sure when screwing it together that the washer is placed right since fixing that problem the arm rest have been sturdy.  But other than that it’s a solid chair and I am very happy with it.

    I was squeamish to but a gaming chair off of Amazon, but this one caught my eye and also had some great reviews. Turns out I was correct. I received the chair today and all the parts were neatly packaged and labelled. Assembly of products can sometimes be difficult, but it was not with this chair. It took just under 30 minutes to put the entire chair together. I am 6'2 and 150 lbs. and it fits me very comfortably. My only complaint would be the footrest not really being a ""footrest"" its more of a ""back of the knee rest"" for us tall folk, lol. All in all, this is a great gaming/work from home chair. If you sit at a desk to game or work, I highly recommend this chair!!!!!

    Purchased this in December of 2023.  It was easy to assemble and comfortable to start.  But now, barely 3 months later, the studs in the armrest under the padding have broken leaving the padded part of the armrest to flop off.  There seems to be no way to contact the manufacturer to get a replacement part either in warranty or to purchase.  Very disappointing..

    I am a gamer but I bought this chair specifically for work, as I started a WFH job and needed to be able to reach my desk without straining my elbows like I was with my previous chair. This chair is fantastic, and more comfortable than the $500+ office chairs that my previous employers would buy. It is firm, in a good way, kind of like it's been stuffed fully. There is a slight plastic-y leather-y smell that is pretty strong but I'm sure will pass. Update: it did indeed pass within hours, honestly. I'm not a sensitive smell person so it may be more like a day or two if you are one, but now half a year later it doesn't even smell if I press my face against it and breathe as deep as I can. I have not done anything to try to remove the smell, I don't light candles, etc.I decided to ignore the armrest issues other reviews mentioned, and then when I tried to install them I initially thought I had the same issue. However, you just need to press firmly while rotating the wrench, because the bearings will simply turn otherwise, presumably for the function of being able to lean the chair back. So, you are not stripping the screw and it is not an issue of length; just press very firmly, and you will feel the resistance of screwing it in and will be able to feel it reach full tightness.If you have any issues with the rubber ring for the footrest, what worked for me is holding it very firmly with one hand at the top, and using the wrench to pull the bottom over. It takes some tries, but I just wasn't able to get it on with my bare hands.

    So I work from home and in creating me a work from home space my partner also wanted a work from home space even though he does not work from home.I told him that he could get a chair that he wanted, but at least had to match the aesthetic and the rest of the room and we were going with neutrals.He was really obsessed with having a gaming chair and the options that he showed me were atrocious and were not going to fit my vibe at all.Therefore, I did my own research and came across this chair which is essentially just like the other chairs he was showing me, but it’s a very beautiful, soft, neutral cream, which goes perfectly with the rest of my office space.It was a little challenging to put together, but it is very comfortable.

    It looks just like the picture when assembled.  However, there was a problem with the chair...it has three rips/tears in the leather/vinal material but nothing I can't live without.  The packaging was damaged on one corner but was limited to the packaging itself and nothing inside.  I took pictures of the damaged box just in case but didn't need to make an issue out of it.  Assembly would've been a breeze except that there weren't enough of the right screws.  I got the right screws from the local hardware store.  They send ""extra"" fasteners but not the ones I needed.  Comfort and use are spot on and fulfill the reasons I bought this chair.

    Got it for brother for his birthday and he said it’s a 5/5.Cons:-the material is gonna be easy to stain, but most like this are.-putting the legs on was a struggle because you gotta hit them hard against the floor to make sure they are in properlyPros:-instructions were clear-didn't take that long to put together, about average time-looks like a fancy car kind of seat, exactly like the picture-has Bluetooth speakers built in if you like that sort of thing-can lean back and kick your feet upNot sure if user error but the foot rest is a little janky about sliding in and out, but I might’ve not tightened the screws properly so don’t let that deter you! I got weak hands so it’s probably my fault.Overall, fresh out of the box and freshly built: we are happy with it. Let’s see if it holds up to gamer rage later tho.Highly suggest so far!

    I’m 6 foot eight and 330 pounds and it seems to work well for me I’m not sure how long it will last though it’s a good option for the next year maybe two but if I were you I’d just spend the extra hundred bucks and get one that will last upwards of four years maybe five or six

    The chair is comfortable. The only problem was the left arm was very hard to attach due to the screw receiver on the seat being misaligned. Otherwise easy to assemble & granddaughter loves the chair & built-in speakers.

    Great for everything else and all the options and accessories are great for the price. Only tiff is the bottom is very flat. Not good for hours or streaming but I bought a separate seat cushion to help.

    I had difficulty putting together the base. It takes alot of muscle to put them so lined up with the screws. I didn't know if there was an easier way so emailed the company. They went above and beyond sent out a new base and 2 lwgs. Plus pillows. My left thumb was broken putting this chair together but that is my fault. Looks great and my son loves it. Definitely recommend buying this chair.

    Bought as a gift and went over well.  Received many compliments on color and style.  So much so, may have to get one for myself.
