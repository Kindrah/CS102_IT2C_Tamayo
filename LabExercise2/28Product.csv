    Really for the price, this is a great gaming mouse.  The mouse has good tracking, a bit heavy to move when not on a mouse pad.  The controlling programs is a breeze to use.  Honestly easier to use than Corsair.  The mouse feels good in the hand and buttons are great.  I am sure it will last a while

    The RGB looks great, all the modes are nice! The mouse tracks well, and there is no blinding light on the bottom. The braided wire is sturdy, and the mouse has a nice weight to it. The app lets you set DPI to your liking, and the rapid fire key is great.

    I like the lights it’s not too much and looks cool at night. Material feels like a good quality and sensitivity of the mouse is pretty good. You can also adjust the sensitivity depending on your preference.

    Pretty solid for the price point for a mouse. Other than the dpi switching in its own it’s not bad and very comfortable to use. The software is a little tricky to find and download but once you do you can change up the settings on there and be happy with it.

    I am a big fan of Redragon mice! I usually buy them when they are on sale, but even when they are not on sale, they are still super affordable. Their build quality, feel, and features are on par with the expensive mice for a fraction of the price. I'm a bit of a keyboard and mouse snob and collector. I will often buy them on sale even if I don't really need them, just because I just like to change them out and see what feels and works best. I've had four different model Redragon mice so far (3 wired and 1 wireless) and all of them have worked great. None of them have had any mechanical or LED failures at all.

    Upstairs I have a white and black version of this mouse. On a black mouse, dust collects and makes it look ugly. On a white mouse, dust still collects, but the white color camouflages the dust. It is an easy task to clean a black mouse, but this task needs to be performed quite often. However, on a white mouse, the war with dust is not as detailed. Most of the time, a dust war cannot be seen on white terrain.Downstairs I only have 1 black mouse. But I keep it downstairs because I can never see any dust collect on the black mouse when downstairs. There is a dust war upstairs, but there is no dust war downstairs. Everyone has a different environment. You will need to perform research in your own environment to find out if you need to fight off dust. I have to upstairs, but I don't have to downstairs.

    I won’t lie, I have a lot of game rage so I blow through mouses quickly. I have two PCs, one at home and one for college. My college PC is brand new and premium and I had a good MSI setup going. I tried the RedDragon mouse for my home PC and was so impressed I came back to college with it and threw out the MSI mouse which was actually more expensive surprisingly. One thing I’ll note that is a bit weird is that the DPI button is under the mouse and RGB buttons are on the top. Kinda strange but aye I gotta get my exercise in one way or another so thanks for that as well.

    I already a mech keyboard from the same company and it has worked great for over two years now, so I decided to go with them again when my older, but much more expensive mouse started to act up. It’s honestly just as nice as ones $50 dollars and up. No reason to spend that kind of money on a wired keyboard these days.

    My husband had gifted me a keyboard from this same company, and I liked it! When I was in need of a new mouse, I decided to look to see if Redragon had some good ones! No problems with it at all! A great mouse overall!

    A mi novia de manos pequeñas le resulto algo incómodo, pero si no es tu caso lo encontraras muy ergonómico. A diferencia de otros modelos, la calidad del cable es igual a la de las fotos, el tejido se ve resistente. Por el precio vale la pena.

    My child is in love with this mouse. Especially loves the colorful lights. I do want you to know the light are on even when you close your laptop, but you could simply unplug it when not using.

    I like RedDragon. I have several other devices from them as well. However, this mouse has some weird quirks. First off, I got it used from Amazon Warehouse. It took basically 3-4 weeks to get it. Next, there is a software package you can install to control the lights, speed, etc. I strongly suggest using it, because the mouse will randomly change color or pattern of the lights. Finally, it doesn't fit completely comfortably in my hand. The material used where your thumb rests just feels... odd.I don't hate the mouse, I'm just really glad I didn't pay full price for a brand new one.

    I tried several and this one is a winner. I don’t play games but it flies through word processing and spreadsheet work like a champ.  Extremely accurate and smooth. For that price.  Come on this would be great at twice the price.  And BTW you can set the fire button to double click. Open files and folders with one well-placed button.

    So far this is a great mouse--especially for the price. The main 'bump' is towards the back of the mouse which I like because I have more of a claw grip. I've been running a DeathAdder (also great mouse) but its main bump is in the middle which doesn't work with my hands as well.

    I use this mouse not for gaming but for the extras this mouse has. First, I hate it when batteries run out on your mouse; that is why I like wired. Next, this mouse has extra buttons you can program to do whatever you need. The colors are cool, and it goes only with my mouse pad, which also has colors.

    This mouse has a lot of nice features. The RGB is really nice with different modes to cycle through. Buttons are very tactile and offer a solid ""click"". The ability to adjust dpi on the fly is really awesome. There are two buttons for adjusting it up/down on the top and the color change that flashes for couple of seconds determines the dpi setting you are currently using. You can also use the third button on the top of the mouse to adjust the RGB. There is also a rapid fire button next to the left mouse click and a mode switch button at the bottom of the mouse. Lots of great features for such an inexpensive mouse. Smooth, beatiful, and comfortable to use.

    [Updated 2/15/24] My computer used to automatically go to sleep after a timer and stopped doing it recently. I left the mouse unplugged overnight to troubleshoot and woke up to a sleeping computer. I believe it's either the stiff cord causing the mouse to move very slightly when there's a vibration, or something in the mouse software. I have noticed the mouse moving on its own a few times since I wrote my last review. For reference I use a Windows 10 desktop PC. This ""feature"" may not be an annoyance to some but I'd rather spend money on a mouse that doesn't do this.-------Old review:Good option if you want a cheap gaming mouse with RGB. The only cons for me are: the wire's braided material does not allow it to lay flat on your desk (pictured). The included Redragon software is lackluster and could use some improvements; it's a bit slow and tends to leave itself open upon startup instead of auto-minimizing itself. Also, to use the programmable buttons, they need to be bound to something in the software, they cannot be ""OFF"" or unbound or no program will detect them. Annoying if you want to bind them to something for a game but have them not work otherwise, though you could always program one of the top buttons to switch between profiles. The included ""Rapid Fire Button"" is kind of an awkward reach even for someone like me 5'10"" with big hands, I'd rather it be somewhere on the side of the mouse instead of way in the corner of the left-click. Either way, decent budget mouse, though I personally would look for something with a less stiff cord and better software.

    You will think this is a high DPI mouse, well it is not, what they advertise is misleading as the 8000 DPI are divided by ""modes"" where the real DPI of the mouse is only 4000.Well, it turns out you need a software to access the whole 8k DPI.It works pretty well. Customer support was fast in providing an answer. Left it at 4 coz the info should be more clear.
