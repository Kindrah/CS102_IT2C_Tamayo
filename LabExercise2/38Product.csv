    I currently play on PC and have used the xbox one controller since 2014 but this PS5 controller is honestly way better.- For bigger hands like mine, this one fills your hands. If you ever used the ps4 controller you know what I mean. Theres no fatigue after 30 minutes because the controller keeps your hands at a comfy position.- The tech is impressive, the trigger feedback thing is wild. Playing Helldivers the trigger starts to get harder to pull as I run out of ammo. And yes this is on PC connected through bluetooth.Id highly recommend this controller to anyone either in need of an upgrade or just a new controller.

    If you’re a true PS5 Gamer, then this is for you! Not only does the color look black like from the original look of the PS4 Controller, it also feels amazing with comfortable grip, smooth handling controls, and holds nice and stable together.

    I bought this controller for my son and he loves it and uses it everyday. It is very durable despite being dropped more than once, lol. Definitely recommend. He likes all the software features you're able to change on the console with custom profiles. He did say It's WAY overpriced compared to other controller prices. He also said the battery on the controller doesn’t last more than like 7 hours so you will have to charge it a lot. They need to improve that feature.

    It's a PS5 controller.  It works well.This was a replacement for the controller that came with the original system.  That one was always a bit flaky, particularly when using the headset jack.

    Solid black and bland. Came time to replace a launch DualSense, and I wanted something different than the default white/black. The DualSense color lineup is dreadful, and fun colorways a seem to come near the end of Sony console cycles. Regardless, went with the solid black with every intention of customizing. So far, I've just added a brushed metal accent trim shell, but it really lifts the controller's aesthetic. Going to do thumbsticks and touchpad cover next.

    From the brilliant minds that got millions of people's Credit Card data hacked due to their incompetence, I present to you:A PC-compatible controller that doesn't include the CORD USED TO LITERALLY RECHARGE THE DAMN THING.Hello? Sony? Anyone home over there? The boneheaded decisions yall are making lately are pretty alarming, but this one is exceptionally stupid and greedy. If a non-battery device requires charging and is used for the PC, then why would you assume the buyer has a PS5?Stupid, stupid, stupid. Unbelievably, unfathomably stupid.

    That's the PlayStation 5 controller design. The cover console, is original. That is a black console by 'faceplate', I left the reverse cover, because it is windowed with the PlayStation (relief). The 'mmidnight' controller, (not pictured) is black.As a companion console (no disk), these include a bid, to install downloaded games from other Asia companies,. Even though my company won the bid, it produced a more complete product within the US, (with disk player). The console disks insert readable surface up, that retailed at around 500$. The PlayStation 5 console crossover, was made available from Wal-Mart.

    Not much to say if you like the DualSense controller then buy it from here, heard people had problems receiving used controllers but i got it new in the box like you're supposed to so im happy.

    My son purchased this, he’s gone through 4 in a year. Hoping for the best with this one and that it’s durable enough to last.

    My controller that came with ps5 has a bad type c port after years of general use. The first gen controllers were intentionally bad. Hopefully this one lasts.

    If you need to replace one of your controllers or my case you only have one, I recommend getting this PS five controller caveat because it’s a Sony controller it’s going to cost you $70. Back in the day you could get them for $40-$50 but not anymore; you’re looking at $70 a controller.

    When I got it and opened the box to my surprise there was greasy finger prints on it.. a bit gross but so far it feels durable hopefully there is no internal damage and this last longer then my original remote controller I’m hoping!

    Was a PlayStation controller, but was missing the charging cable which is key because it’s not just a charging cable. It’s the communication cable as required for syncing it with the PlayStation console.
