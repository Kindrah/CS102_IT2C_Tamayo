    This remote is really good! My old remote was gross and sticky from stuff being spilled on it, and I got these as a replacement and they work perfectly! We didn't have to sync them to the TV or anything, they worked right away and the Netflix, YouTube, etc. buttons also work! No voice activation which sucks, but it's definitely a good and cheap replacement if you're needing a new remote for your Roku TV :)

    Had no issues with them working for my roku as soon as batteries were put in. No programming was necessary. Great buy!!

    I would prefer not to explain how it happened but I dropped the remote in the toilet. Sadly, not a clean bowl. Still, I tried to salvage it but it had to be washed. It did not work after that. I got these remotes the next day. They work. Happy about that

    If you're in need of a reliable replacement remote for your Roku TV, look no further. This one not only works perfectly but also eliminates the hassle of complicated setup procedures. Highly recommended for its simplicity and efficiency! I just hit the power button and it turned right on. Gone are the days of following 100 different command prompts on the universal remote.

    I came home from a long trip, and my TCL remote control was no longer working. I assumed the batteries had died, but even replacement batteries couldn't get it working.Roku wanted $20 for 1 remote, which works out to about 4x the price of one of these badboys. They also no longer sell remotes without a built-in microphone. Hey Roku, I don't need a microphone on my remote control. I already have enough gadgets spying on me. I just wanted a cheap replacement that works.This worked perfectly right out of the box. A surprising bonus was a new key on this remote control, which is a shortcut to setting a sleep timer. I also use 3/4 of the channel shortcut keys, so that worked out better than my old remote as well.Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase.

    These remotes are amazing and work great right out of the packaging. The reason it got 4 stars is because there are no instructions that say remotes do not need to be programmed, just add batteries and use. They come with a QR you need to scan but it only works with downloading a third party app, once downloaded and scanned it just gives you the capabilities on how to use a remote, so dumb. But these are ready to go right out of the packaging. Two remotes for this price is not bad.

    Okay first off, the remotes do not contain batteries you will need AAA. Next, I was in a rush to buy these and did not read the description which clearly states they were ONLY for smart TVs. Not the sticks/other attachments. Lastly these do work amazingly with a smart tv I have one luckily or I would’ve needed to return these. They were meant to replace my remotes I lost when moving but for now it only replaced one. So hopefully I find the real Roku remotes for my attachment. Anyway if you are looking for a new smart tv remote I think these are a great idea. They are very responsive and you don’t need to connect them in anyway. It’s an automatic connection. It can be used on any smart tv listed in the description from what I assume. I have a onn Roku tv that I used mine on and it worked great. If you are getting this for some type of attachment it will not work (I tried just in case but it needs physically paired, the correct remote should have a pairing button under the battery cover). I hope this review helps.

    We needed a new remote asap. This one was exactly what we were looking for. Bonus of two for the price of one and an extra bonus, it was delivered right to our front door the same day as we ordered it. I don't know how they did it but we are impressed and happy.

    Worked well right out the box!!  Just need to the purchase batteries! Honestly was a steal only 10$ for two remotes when the name brand one is more expensive for one. Having an extra one works out for my favor, since my dog chewed my remote up in the first place.

    These saved our butts as parents. My daughter is constantly loosing her remotes. Even the link room ones as often as her bed room.  We ordered this 2 pack after hers had been missing weeks at that point.  Both remotes worked perfect after putting battery in them.  I had to do no programming or anything. She has a Roku smart tv.  And the best part was they are exact same as the one that came with it so her glow in the dark silicone remote cases  fit right on no problem.  Oh and soon as they arrived to my home she found her lost one! So we got 3 now for her tv, 1 hidden in my bedroom!

    I have  4’TCL TV and we’ve gone through many remotes due to my dog deciding to use them as chew toys.The remotes work very well with our TVs in our home.just add batteries and your remote is good to go.  Thank goodness for these remotes!

    These remotes work better than the ones that came with the TV’s!! For setup you just put batteries in them and point at the tv as simple as that. I turned around and pointed it in the opposite direction as my tv and it still worked, before I would have to make sure it(remote that came with tv) was pointed directly at the tv. Stop looking around and just buy these! I’ll update review if they stop working

    So, my dog literally ate a remote for one tv, and the remote for the other was missing the power button thanks to a teething toddler. I saw the listing for a pair of Roku remotes for about $10 with good ratings and decided to take a chance. So far, I am glad I did. All I did was put a AAA in each remote and they worked with both my tv's instantly with no programming necessary.  I have a Best Buy house brand tv and a TCL and the remotes both work without fuss. There are a few buttons I have not yet tried, but I assume that since the power, volume, and back buttons are working the others likely due as well.

    I have an older TV with the  remote getting a little weak on sending. This is better than the original; It has a wider field of view and an easier press on the button. It seems much stronger than the last 3 or 4 I have ordered over the years. If it holds up I will be very happy. It also has an extra dedicated button for the sleep timer which will come in handy for me.

    Great replacements for our original Roku TV remotes. Everything works fine right out of the box for both our Vizio Roku TVs. Very light, but had a few small drops with no issues.

    Good deal on these because you definitely need two! There isn't anything wrong with them, and I just needed a basic one to work with the Roku TV.

    We had ordered a different universal remote for our new smart TV, but it wouldn’t program to connect to our TV (it was supposed to be compatible). Ordered this set of two when I logged in to return the other one. When the new ones arrived, I put batteries in them and hit as button as I was replacing the battery cover….TV came on! No programming required! We especially love the YouTubeTV button that takes us directly there.

    I don't know about anyone else but my kids destroy remotes. They are always losing the battery cover and the remote itself.  This cover is amazing. It allows us to find the remote better and keeps the kids from removing the battery cover. The remote is a slippery sucker and this cover gives us a nice grip.

    Apparently turning the tv off and dropping the remote to the floor as you fall asleep isn't a smart thing to do! LOL So I had to buy a new one.This product actually works better than the one the Roku TV came with! Worked right out of the box. And it came with 2!!Shipped really fast.

    I have a short term rental and only use the Roku remotes.  From time to time these remotes go on vacation somewhere and can't be found again.  So I have a few on hand for when I can't find the remotes and they work perfectly!  Highly recommend and I'm sure I will be buying again in the future.  Much better than using the regular TV remote as these identify your TV immediately once the batteries are installed.

    The remotes are great, for the price of 1 you get 2. They don’t come with batteries so if you don’t have them you may want to order them at the same time. Inserted a pair of AAA batteries and didn’t have to program anything. They worked as expected. Now all you have to worry about is fighting over who gets to watch what…

    I bought 4 of these thinking they would control a Roku attached to a TV. These are Toku TV remotes and NOT made to operate the roku units that attach to the TV.If there's a volume control on the side it will not operate a roku. Volume tells you that it's a TV remote.Returned and refunded with no issues.
