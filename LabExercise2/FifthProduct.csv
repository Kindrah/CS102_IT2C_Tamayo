    Love it. I'm not good at asymbeling and this was super easy. Just do one step At a time and read the notes per step. Last gamer chair I had was a titan secret lab  and this was as comfy as that. The armbars don't move but that wasn't a problem for me.the footrest is just a easy sliding bar that doesn't really extend to far but still worked for me. The headrest is OK but is not luxury comfort. Having said all that for the money and ease of setup it's a great deal for under $200. The chair is really comfortable the recliner steadily stops at several recline positions. If you knew what you were doing 100 percent you could set this chair up I'm 10 minutes but with reading it's probably a 40 minute setup. When you connect the top to the bottom there is a slot at the bottom the top fits in so you can easily screw the screws in with one person. No extra tools required or needed. While it's not premium luxury it is a really really comfortable chair and even has a massager that uses USB. Its not super strong but it does a good job. Only complaint it's a little loud but not deafening. If your looking to spend under 200 and need a one person setup I highly recommend this chair! Delivery was also fast! It's a little intimidating when first opening but the directions were fairly easy to follow. Had a few extra screws in the end but I think they are just backups. Just buy it lol.

    Highly adjustable for seating and reclining preference. The chair and parts do not feel cheap or like it won't last long. The reclining feature has a lock to set it exactly where you want it. The bottom back pad has a vibrating feature which while not like a massage chair, feels nice to use. Too many gaming/computer chairs are way overpriced; for what you get, this chair is a solid purchase. May not fit larger legs or waist, (I'm 230lbs, 250lbs would be the upper limit for seat space between arm rests). On the stiff side, but with back and head cushion.

    I got this chair on sale for $110 (not counting shipping) which I recommend you do.Assembly: It took barely an hour to put together and could’ve honestly been quicker than that had I not been multitasking. It’s incredibly easy/simple to assemble, a child (of good enough strength to tighten the screws and lift the chair) could build this. Despite it’s simplistic construction is feels smooth and sturdy.Experience: initially, it felt cheap. The sides of the backing of the chair feel as though they are lined with pool noodles, which threw me off at first. I was worried the chair was going to be stiff or uncomfortable. However, I was pleasantly surprised! It’s very comfortable to sit in, and the telescoping arms and foot rest are incredibly appreciated. I will say the plastic of the arms feels on the cheaper side and they already seemed a little wobbly shortly after construction. This can likely be amended by tightening the screws. The lumbar support pillow sits a little low for me, so I wish it adjusted to an even higher point, but I will say I am rather curvy so that’s likely a me problem. The headrest pillow is very nice and the backrest reclines and locks well, doesn’t feel wobbly or like it’s going to tip backwards. The chair also sits very low which was wonderful since it fit under my bunk bed, *and* fit my legs comfortably under my desk, which is impressive since most others do not (I have thicker thighs).Summary: I think this chair is definitely one of the best on the market for the price point. It’s not exactly top of the market quality but that’s to be expected for only $110. I would expect slightly better quality if I were paying the full $200 for it, though. Recommended on sale, and especially for those on more of a budget. Exceeded expectation. 8/10

    It is exactly what we were looking for ! True to specifications, easy to follow instructions, and came with a few spare pieces of hardware just in case ! I think the purple is even prettier in person ! Very comfortable and sturdy.

    This is a fantastic gaming chair for the price! The seller shipped it promptly after I ordered ,and when I received it I was highly impressed by the ease of assembly. The instructions are the clearest I have ever seen among my furniture kits. It is so comfortable as well, with the lower back pillow supporting my back and helping with my posture. Not to mention, it is quite durable and sturdy so far, holding up great to my ADHD-fueled spinning and rolling across the floor. I would absolutely buy this again!

    I've gone through a few chairs over the years. I've tried office chairs and 'gaming' chairs alike, but they always left me achy and would break down over the course of a few years. I take exquisite care of my stuff (frfr I'm a germaphobe) but I'd have chairs start to tear or fray and leave my back hurting SO bad that it'd make my stomach hurt. I can't say I have the best posture on the face of the planet since I am hyper-mobile but it was ridiculous. I decided to give this chair a try because of the reviews and it seemed reasonably priced compared to the Titan Evo chairs I was looking into ($800).Assembly: Took me a little longer than expected, the instructions aren't the best but are relatively straightforward.Comfort: Fabulous. I can sit criss cross. I can sit like a shrimp. I can kick back and watch a movie. I can hunch over to do my homework. OR I can even sit properly (sometimes). I've never had a sore back no matter how long I've sat in the chair.Price and quality: I'd say this is mid tier quality. A step above ""you get what you pay for"" and a step below ""overpriced gucci chair"" that most companies market towards gamers to price gauge the title of 'gaming chair'.Is it worth it? Yes. I think you are mostly paying for functionality here and not style or aesthetic. Just a generic ol' gamer chair.

    When I received the chair, I was missing some parts. Wheels, screws, levers, chair. Contacting customer service and getting them to send replacements was time consuming. Now that I have been using it for awhile I can give a review. The seat of the chair is not near as comfy as they say, the footstool is very useful or sturdy and the back support of the chair is already losing the padding there and is now very uncomfortable. Also - not made for short people - I'm 5'3""  and I can only just barely have feet flat on floor and the arms are too short (it'd be nice if they could be adjusted.) Definitely not worth the cost.

    I spend a lot of time at a desk. I work from home, go to grad school and I like to game and write in my spare time. I have back issues due to a congenital condition, so a comfortable and supportive chair is very important. I sprang for this one because I really, really needed a better chair than the one I had. I'm not the best at putting things together without a visual like a video,  but the instructions were clear and very easy to follow. I was able to put it together myself, shaking hands, motor control issues and all!The chair is so comfortable and feels sturdy when I sit in it. I have really long legs and the seat itself doesn't feel too short to me at all. The foot rest is a fantastic feature; I will say that it's a bit shorter than I will like, but I chalk that up to my legs being so long. Even with that, putting my feet up at work and being able to recline is a godsend on long days. The armrests feel sturdy and come up to a comfortable height. I tried the massaging lumbar support; it was a bit loud but it's by no means a deal breaker.If you're on a budget and are looking for a gaming or office chair, I would recommend this one for sure! If my husband likes it, I may even get him one.

    I was looking for a gaming chair and out of so many that there are I chose this chair, the colors are all pretty but I chose the black and red one so that it would match my gaming table.  Delivery was very fast, everything arrived in good condition.  When it came to assembling, the manual is very detailed and explains very well. It took about 35 minutes. It was very easy. You just have to do it slowly so as not to get confused with the screws.  The gaming chair looks good quality and I hope it lasts like my last chair for 7 years.

    Have used the chair for a day now after building it, and I am pleased with the overall function especially for the price. It’s is not the best chair in the world, but it is a very good chair and a comfortable one. It reclines far enough to take a nap in with the foot rest, and a vibrating pillow on your lower back. The pillow on top for your neck is tops off making this chair very comfortable.I would highly recommend this chair if you need an above average office chair that’s not going to break your bank. for the price it’s excellent. Building it was easy too and not long, 45-1 hr and it a a short hour. Easy instructions as well.I will say if you are a heavier person I feel like this chair won’t support you as well, at least the foot rest . It says 250lb limit and beileive it’s because of the foot rest as it’s not held in the trails at multiple points, just one screw. Keeps it from sliding forward. Luckily Im I on The lighter side so the foot rest has been my favorite part

    I wanted to wait a week before I did my review and here are my thoughts.  For the price, this is a great chair and I'd buy it again.  I work from home 80% of the time and also play Xbox at night in the same room so I use a chair A LOT.  Previously, I had a cheap desk chair from Amazon that I got in 2020 when the world shut down and we were all working from home.  I'll just do pros and cons:Pros:1. Easy to assemble.2. VERY sturdy chair.  Metal frame and smooth wheels, height and recline adjustments are very smooth and natural3. Vibrating lumbar pillow is a plus.4. Recline is great and feels sturdy.5. Nice to have a pull out footrest.6. Very large seat cushion.  I'm a small guy and can easily sit with my foot under my leg in like a ""4"" very comfortably.7. Cushions on the arms are soft and great for sitting all day.8. Every function is very smooth and feels very sturdy.9. They give you some extra parts.  I was actually missing a couple washers needed for assembly and found what I needed in the ""extra"" parts.10. Neck/head pillow is soft and comfortable.  It's very small but definitely standard for most of these gaming chairs.Cons:1. Seat cushion is NOT very soft.  In fact, it's a little too firm in my opinion.  I found sitting for long periods of time, my butt getting kind of uncomfortable.  I'm assuming over time it will get softer but I wish it had more of a memory foam type cushion on top of the foam.  I got a cheap memory foam cushion pad for my old chair and am actually using it on this one which does help, but then that also puts your position on the chair higher.  This in turn makes the lumbar pillow lower than it really should be.2. The leg rest comes out easy for me (saw some people having issues and you need to make sure the mounts are straight when assembling, they are adjustable as you tighten).  However, the way the leg rest flips out to use makes it very easy for it not to stay where it's supposed to be.  If you rest anything on the inside part of the leg rest, it's going to want to flip into it's storage position.  If you have your legs straight this is not an issue but I found this cumbersome at times.3. It gets kinda warm.  If you're sitting with shorts on or I would imagine if you didn't have a shirt on for some reason (don't know why you wouldn't but you do you), your skin with start to stick to it a bit.  Obviously it's not like getting into a hot car in the summer, but just something to think about.3. Being a shorter guy I wish it did go just a tiny bit lower.  My desk at home is even a little higher than some ""normal"" desks and it doesn't fit under the desk even in it's lowest position.  I can make it fit, but it scrapes the arm cushions a bit and I could see that ripping them in time.  Certainly not a deal-breaker, but if you're used to storing this under your desk, this may be an issue for you as well.4. For the vibrating pillow, you must be connected via USB to a power source.  I'm guessing you could use some type of battery pack but there's also no on/off, once you plug in you're on until you unplug.TL;DR: Great chair for the price.  Seat cushion could be softer imo but function/style/stability is on point.  Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a gaming chair and don't want to spend a lot of money.

    Attaching the back of the chair to the seat was a bit tricky and definitely a two person job, but otherwise assembly was easily done by one person and it’s a great chair! Haven’t set up a desk yet but got it early since it has a footrest and I have knee surgery coming up.

    Amazon wouldn’t accept my photo but the chair does the basics of nothing else. Not hard to put together. The massage pillow just vibrates. Nothing too special. The foot rest is a pain to pull out. I don’t really use it. Chair swivels, it leans back, and it can be lowered or raised.it does its job.

    Price was right, so I ordered it.  For $100-ish not sure how this will hold up as the user is 6ft 2"" and 200lbs.  If he gets a year out of it...then great, its paid for itself.  Very easy to assemble, looks cool, and has some nice features, for example the head rest and pop out leg rest.  Just hope it holds up as now and then it needs tightening up here and there.

    My boyfriend and I both got these and they are great, they don't take up much space and the colors are really nice. Super simple assembly though it seems a little intimidating. The footrest is a game changer. My only critique would be the neck and lumbar pillows do need to be adjusted every time you sit or move off of them but, it only takes a second so it's not a huge deal.

    This is how I would improve the overall quality of this chair.1. provide more robust lower back support2. provide a better seat cushion that's not so hard3. I prefer a straight padded arm rest vs. a curved one. Provides better wrist support.4. Lengthen paddle arms for chair height / back adjustments

    I'm 200lb and 5'2. Mainly use this to sit to do homework or play games. Assembled this by myself. Connecting the top part of the chair to the bottom part is a .... but it would've been easier if I had someone to help me.Pros: color is cute, armrest can be used lying down on the chair, neck pillow and back pillow is comfy, back pillow can massage, footrest, chair is comfy on my butt(very important I had to buy a butt pillow for my last chair)can be improved: wish there was a royal blue or lighter blue option, the armrest can't be adjusted lower or higher( I prefer it to be a bit higher), no on/off button on the massage pillow

    Not bad, quality fits the price, easy to assemble. The lumbar massage pillow is a simple vibration, nothing fancy but it does feel good after doing some deadlifts or fight sports. Took me about 40min to assemble myself. The fabric option would probably be easier to maintain, because the fuax leather gets marked easier with sweat, its easy to clean, but I'll probably have to do it often.

    Now I was super excited to receive this chair I ordered for My Son . It came a day early. God bless the delivery man who brought it up my stairs cause it was a heavy box. Putting together was very simple. It took me about a whole 40 minutes to put it together by myself, the chair itself was so comfortable literally between the leg rest and be able to recline all the way back. You could just fall asleep in the massaging pillow. Very nice touch. I am very very happy with this product.

    This chair would have been easier to put together if the screws would have been in easier packaging to open. The pictures are super small and once you get the screws out of the package it is hard to figure out which ones to use. Otherwise the chair was easy to assemble. It just took longer because of the packaging.

    I like the chair and it seems well built. I have only had it about a week so time will tell. I use this chair in my home office which doubles as my gaming room. I had a big comfortable office chair that this is replacing. I will say this gaming chair is not as comfortable as my office chair. It doesn't rock back, but the back is adjustable and the lumbar massage pillow is nice, but there is no control for it. It's on or off and always on full vibration. I am 6' tall and 200lb and I think if I was any bigger this chair wouldn't work for me. I think a little more padding in the seat would be a nice upgrade. Like I said time will tell do I will update this review after I have used it for some time.

    It must be comfortable because my son fell asleep in it last night. I did have the tighten the screws for the arms after a few uses. They didn't stay tight. But other than that no complaints. Only advise is to hold on to the tools it comes with.

    Have a lot of friends with secret labs chairs that told me not to buy this and it’s terrible. Personally I think it’s fine. I’d it a lazy boy no. But for the price I can sit and game in it for 5 hours and I’m fine.

    My 6 year old picked this out for his new bed room. It was very important to him to have his very own gamer chair. It was easy to put together, it's sturdy. Works well for my son and fits me as well. Easily adjustable if needed and we completely missed the massage part when purchasing so that was a cool surprise.

    Easy to assemble, my grandson loves it says it’s comfortable. The only issue is if he has it reclined he has to be careful not to stretch as it will tobble over

    After 5 months of regular use, the welding of the bracket used to connect the arm to the frame has broken off. Now the arm cannot be used and definitely cannot be easily repaired. For the price though, it's been a good chair!

    I'm obsessed with this chair. I was struggling in an old classic black pleather Walmart special before with 2 seat cushions under my rear and a blanket over the back for support. This chair cradles me so well. The lumbar pillow is easily adjusted to where you need it based on what angle or position you desire to sit at. The neck cushion is similarly adjustable, though not as extensively as the lumbar one. The material is soft yet feels sturdy, I got the all light grey one and even with 2 dogs, and ""house sweatpants"" with dog hair, it remains clean. Hair brushes off easily and a Tide pen is perfect for spot cleaning.The adjustable foot rest is incredible. I can sit with my legs crossed or extended. I'm 5'4"" and this seat lowers to the point where I can sit flat footed and in perfect posture. I also have a floor cushion for my own sake because I have a nerve condition. I typically spend HOURS at a time in this chair and I don't have the extreme pain and discomfort one would expect from a typical desk chair. The arm rests are cushioned so well, so propping your forearms or elbows on them is plush and comfortable.Asswmbly was swift and simple, with thorough directions and tools provided. Everything about this chair feels smooth and sturdy. The only thing I haven't tried is the massager in the lumbar cushion, so look to other reviews for that :)

    Don’t get me wrong the chair is nice but in comfort wise this chair is not comfortable for plus size people the seat is a bit to hard to be sitting for 2 hours, if you do end up getting the chair i definitely recommend buy a memory foam cushion.

    My granddaughter loves it. It said lombard support but we didn't expect it is heated lombard support. What a great idea.

    Bought this chair when on sale during Black Friday for my son. The price point was good but after assembly I found the seat cushioning was a little hard. Some may like a harder seat but not me. My son did not care so we just kept it. There are more comfortable chairs on the market. Not sure were the rating ""For Gaming"" comes into play as you can sit on a bucket or even the floor and play video games. I know for me when I play to sit for an extended period of time 1-2 hours to game I am looking for a comfortable seat.

    Very easy to assemble, all hardware was included.  It's not the most comfortable but from the reviews I figured I'd end up getting some extra cushions for it.  Lowered all the way, my feet are flat on the floor (I'm 5'6"").  The levers for the recline and height are a bit further in than I'd like but it's not a huge deal.  It's a bit annoying to get the head and lumbar pillow adjusted to the right height and to stay put but again, I figured I'd getting new cushions anyway.  The foot rest is cool but it's more of a calf rest, I'm not sure how functional it would work for someone taller.  The back of the chair is a lot thinner than I thought it would be, hoping it holds up over time.  For the price it's a good deal, I just wouldn't expect anything phenomenal.

    I really like it, the material seems good quality and it comes with 2 small pillows (one of them is vibrating) but the chair seems a smudge too firm for me. Its ok when its inclined but it would probably be uncomfortable sitting strait up for long periods of time...I like the idea of the footrest, but it seems useless to me (not long enough to hold your legs comfortably, or put your feet on, unless you tuck them maybe)...I like the different color options, really wanted the white and pink but went for black and purple for cleaning purposes (but the material seems pretty easy to clean)Assembly was ok, lots of pieces but not that terrible.
