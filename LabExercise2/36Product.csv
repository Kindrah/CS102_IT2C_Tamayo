    For reference I've had a Ficmax and Dowinx gaming chair previous to this one. I wanted a chair in the same competitive market as both but one that matched the aesthetic of my current gaming set up.The biggest plus to me is that this chair was the easiest to assemble out of all three chairs. No awful pilot holes, everything was clearly labeled, only took 5 steps, and most of the screws already had the washers placed onto them before being neatly packaged.Immediately comfortable out of the box, and in pristine condition considering white is the hardest to maintain.All in all this chair is my recommendation compared to both Ficmax and Dowinx.

    After I research on Amazon , this is the gaming chair I picked!I have to say it’s way better what I thought! First it has easy instructions to install, all parts packed well.Second, it’s comfortable that you can adjusted the back to any angle you like.Finally, the texture of material feel good and you can tell it’s not cheap~Overall I am very satisfied with this product, I think it’s time to get your own gaming chair!!!

    Looking for a comfortable gaming chair?The OneGame Video Gaming chair provides long duration comfort for those extended gaming sessions. The chair is super easy to build and everything needed is provided. (Including the 6MM allen wrench). In terms of comfort, I’ve used this chair for long coding sessions, and a few long video games and found it to be very comfortable. I guess the most important observation is that I didn’t notice the chair even after an hour of sitting in it. If you are going to be seated for a long time, then consider the OneGame chair.RecommendedBuild: My total installation time was approximately 30 minutes from start to finish. The instructions were extremely clear except for one tiny area. The back bar can be installed in two ways, and the installation instructions are not clear on the correct method. The manual has a QR code that is labeled installation video, but it doesn’t go to a video either. No matter, I skipped that step initially and after building the seat area, it became evident that the back bar needed to be installed with the side with three screws facing down. I also found an installation video on Amazon that shows the correct orientation. (at 1:06 into the video). Overall, the chair build was simple, easy, and fast.Ergonomics: The mesh back and soft seat make this chair comfortable for long periods of time. I had a little issue with getting the headrest, lumbar support, and armrests into position. I think the chair is designed for humans under 6 feet tall. I just removed the headrest to be comfortable since it was too low on my back. The lumbar support falls down every time I get up, but it’s trivial to put it back in place. The armrests will go up and down, and slide front to back, but do not rotate in place.Feel: The chair rolls smoothly on nice high quality wheels. Additionally, the materials seem well made and have a “new car” scent. The scent went away within 12 hours, but I enjoyed it while it lasted.

    This is the best gaming chair I have ever owned so far, and I've gone though many over my 16 years of playing World of Warcraft! It was very quick and easy to assemble, it took my husband less than 15 minutes to put it together. The instructions were clear and the hardware was well organized.The chair is surprisingly comfortable to sit in for hours. It reminds me of a higher-end driver's seat. The seat cushion is wide and comfortable, not too stiff or too squishy, I would say pretty much perfect. The cushion is vented,so it doesn't retain heat.The backrest is comfortable as well. I wasn't sure if I would like the mesh backing, but it provides support and does keep me cool with the open ventilation. The headrest pillow has an elastic band to keep it in place and is easily adjustable. This also comes with a small lumbar pillow that helps provide great lumbar support. The only down side to this pillow is that it doesn't have an elastic band to keep it in place, so you will have to consistently adjust it to where you want it.The tilt/recline feature is top notch. Great range of angles and the full recline is stable and comfortable. Can absolutely take a nap in this chair if you want to! The seat height adjustment is easy to use and the hydraulic is strong. The arms rests are 3D, so they adjust forward, backward, and up & down. I like the ability to be able to adjust them to make my arms more comfortable while gaming or being on the computer.Also, the caster wheels on this gaming chair are smooth as silk. They glide so effortlessly on my tile floor and the chair is so easy to move, even while sitting down on it. My last gaming chair was old and the wheels were so bad, I could barely roll it around!The only negative I have to say about this chair isn't even about it's materials or construction. It has a couple of black scuff markings on it (pictured) that came on it as we were unpacking it. Not sure where they came from, but it was unfortunate to have marks on the seat cushion and on top of the chair upon arrival. I tried cleaning them off also, but they seem to be permanent black marks. It doesn't take away from the functionality of this chair at all, but it's something to be aware of if you decide to order a white one, it may or may not come with black scuff marks.Overall, I am thrilled with this gaming chair and I absolutely love it. I wholeheartedly give it 5 stars and very much recommend buying it!

    Of all the computer chairs that I have owned, this is definitely one of the most comfortable. My favorite feature of this chair is how the chair reclines, most reclining gaming chairs will only go back and set at 3 or 4 different points and then be locked in to that specific point, where as this chairs reclining can be stopped and set at any point. The seat cushion is nice and is right at that goldilocks zone where it is just fits in between of being soft and firm, and all in the right spots.The assembly is super easy for this chair, the construction is literally 2 pages with big pictures and labels for all the parts and hardware. My wife and I were watching a Tv Show when I was assembling it, and I had it completed before the episode had finished, so in total it takes maybe somewhere between 25-30 minutes start to finish.There is one issue I have with this chair, and that is the backrest, or the back of the chair. It looks and feels like some cheap plastic, mine is NOT broken or busted, but the molding in a few big different spots is very warped, like most plastic molds are made with big metal molds that are pressed together and then molten plastic is poured into it and when they separate the molds it has a perfect shape, the back rest for this however with this kind of warping seems like it was made from one side of a mold, that they just panned and rolled the molten plastic into place with.The reason i bring this up is because the chair pops loudly every time i set in it and lean back. It is a loud enough pop that sounds like something is broken, but I have checked this chair multiple times over, and made sure all the bolts are securely in place, nor is there any busted plastic. So this brings up the question of Longevity, and I cannot be certain that this chair is durable enough to last even a year without falling apart. Now that being said, I have only had this chair for less than a week, its just a sign that this chair is giving that that normally doesn't surface well into a chairs life, and this one is Brand new. I have a sneaking suspicion that the warping in the back plastic I was speaking of is the culprit for the loud popping the chair exhibits when you lean in it.All that being said, the rollers are smooth and the arm rest are great, the Popping in the back rest doesn't make it any less comfortable of a chair and it is indeed super comfortable especially being able to lock the backrest in anywhere.

    This is a great looking chair and is super comfortable. It was a great addition to my gaming setup. I love how unique the white color is. My wife calls it my storm trooper chair. The seat has this perforated leather look that reminds me of a high-end sports car. The neck and back rest are really nice to have. The mesh back and perforated seat breathe really well, so I don't get hot in this chair.It's easy to adjust the height of the chair and the height of the arm rests. Make sure to lock the tilt mechanism. The first time I sat in the chair I nearly fell over backwards.The chair was pretty easy to assemble in about 10-15 minutes. The instructions were good, although the pictures and font were really small. The base required more assembly than other chairs I've owned. It included extra screws, which I greatly appreciate. The toughest part of assembly was attaching the back bottom plastic plate. It was a little difficult to line up and get snapped into place.The only thing I would change about the chair is the lumbar support. It falls down the second I get up. If it could attach to the chair I think this would be an improvement.

    Got this primarily as my office chair. The chair itself has quite a bit of weight to it so that seemed good before even opening the box.Once the delivery box was opened it was disappointing to see that not everything was packed great. The gas lift has already broken through it's packing.  It looked like the base plate wasn't packed right, and the box looked like it was opened (maybe this was while it was at an Amazon distribution center?), but when the chair costs as much as it does, you expect everything to be packed right.  Luckily nothing looked damaged and everything was in the box.Assembly doesn't take very long. The instructions are clear and the screws you need to use are also labeled, so that makes it so much easier. It took me maybe 15 mins to assembly this chair.  Ah allen wrench is included so you need no tools to assemble it.The chair looks good assembled.  The backing is mesh, and feels decent. There's a plastic backing that's the back of the chair and basically it's hollow in-between that and the mesh.  The cushion has good support and feels good fit extended periods of sitting.  I'm not sure how it's going to hold up over time, if it'll flatten, but for now it's good.  The material feels decent too (again hoping the wear and tear is good on this).The armrests, initially look hard, but they have some give so that's a plus. They're not ""soft"" but they're made of what seems like injection molded plastic.  They're comfortable and they have enough height adjustments that my elbows can rest on them properly.The raising and lowering of the chair is easy, and the gas lift seems to work well.  I don't like that the metal part of the lift is exposed (in most chairs I've seen a plastic flexible cover over it). I can see this collecting dust, especially since it seems to have a little bit of grease/oil on it. The recline of the back is good too.  I keep it fairly straight, but there are enough adjustments to get the position you want. The rollers on this are very good, and it moves so easy.Overall this is a good chair, and I'm only knocking off a star due to the poor packing.

    Fairly decent office chair. I love all the different options with the reclining and raising and lowering of the chair. Those work great. It's not as padded or comfortable as some of the office chairs i've had but it works for what I need it to. The extra pillows and lumbar pillow are a little too stiff and are loud when rubbing against the main material of the chair. Assembly was fine besides the instructions not showing a very good description of which direction the back bar needs to go. So I guess on that one. Other a decent office chair.

    Definitely a pretty chair with a lot to like about and clearly built not only to play games, which it excels as a gaming chair, but also to relax, which is where I found a little bit of an issue that I'll explain below.I like the overall quality and ergonomics, but I believe that many if not most users will feel that it is a bit on the hard side, which means that it is not super comfortable for relaxing. On the bright side, it will last even being beat by the hard core gamers out there. Here's the odd thing. It feels very comfortable  when playing games. It only feels hard when you try to relax on it. But I would still recommend it since I never found one that would be perfectly comfortable for both functions.

    This chair is great if you have back problems. Comes with great support pillows. I really appreciated the instructions and felt they were incredibly user friendly. Loved that the hardware all came labeled and not in a bag jumbled up together. I do wish the lumbar pillow had a way to be attached and not just sitting in the chair. Also, I wish the arm rests were farther up. They are too far back, so someone as short as me.

    I ordered this gaming chair for my 19yr old grandson and he is pleased with it.It was fairly easy to assemble and looks really nice.He said that it is comfortable for the most part but, is a little firmer than he had thought it would be.Hopefully he will be able to keep it clean!

    The chair look absolutely amazing and is an excellent fit into most interiors because of the color. It is also well-ventilated and comfortable. Recline works well, adjustable armrests are a plus. I didn't quite like the pillows - it is quite cumbersome to use those so I just took them off completely. My biggest complaint is that half of the pieces came with tears and worn spots on the right out of the box. Moreover, these tears cannot be taken off and are pretty deep. Besides that, this is a great chair and well worth it's price.

    It’s nice, I like the reclining feature. It’s comfortable and came with two pillows. Only thing is that the outsides made of plastic so I don’t know how long that’ll last. But it looks nice and it works as it should, wasn’t to super hard to put together, but also not super easy either… like medium level. Comes with the tools you need to put it together. All you need comes in the box with it.

    Ive had a couple of racing chairs and one ergonomic chair and while the ergonomic chair usually beats all my chairs, this gaming chair gave it a run for the money! Unlike most chairs, this one features a straight flat back that I personally find much more comfortable than the standard racing chair, and the cushion is much more thicker than other chairs. For someone with back problems, this chair helps me keep my back more straight than any other chair and that helps me with pain management! Its easy to assemble and really POPS out in my room since its all white! Its commonly mentioned on my stream where I get this chair!

    I really like this chair. It is very sturdy and was extremely easy to assemble. My 4 year old son helped me and we had a great time getting it all put together. Once it was assembled, we both agree that it is very comfortable! The leather is very soft and has the perfect amount of grip. The mesh back is comfortable and allows good airflow to keep you from getting too hot. I think it definitely needs the lumbar cushion, but the head/neck pillow is a bit of an afterthought. It seems to me that the designers and engineers finished a great chair and the marketing team said, “wait! Other gaming chairs have these neck pillow things! People won’t buy it without one of those! Also, we need a second location for our logo!” So the engineers and designers threw one at the marketing team and said, “fine! Use this! It doesn’t need it and we are not changing the design of the chair since it is great the way it is, but if you insist, here is a pillow for your logo!” So, it includes a neck pillow that really only works if the chair is leaning way back and doesn’t really fit well or stay on well. I never lean my chair way back, so I never user my neck pillow. Other than that, the chair is awesome! I got the white one and if you wear new jeans, it might turn it blue. So far, mine is still nice and white. It also has been easy to clean.

    I want to first say that I have had around 6 or 7 gaming chairs already and this one takes the cake. From the easy assembly,  the cool look, to the comfort level of this chair is unbelievable.  Everytime someone comes over and sees my chair they just have to say how cool they think it is.

    I got this chair for use in my kids' computer room.  The chair was very easy to assemble, as a disabled person that's important for me since I am limited in my mobility.It's very comfortable, and the adjustment controls work very nicely.  In addition to the standard height adjustment, the back rest can easily be positioned and locks in place.  The castors roll very smoothly.  The arm rests have a height adjustment which works smoothly and locks solidly, but the arm rests are otherwise fixed in place.If I had any complaint at all, it would be that the lumbar pillow doesn't have any kind of retaining strap or similar to hold it in place, so it's always falling over.  It just rests on the back of the chair.  I don't personally think that warrants removal of a star from an otherwise great chair, but I did want to mention it.

    This thing is so cool looking and comfortable, I feel like I am the captain of my own space ship.  Mine is white, and I am thinking about customizing it with some color.  The back of it has a shell that you can make your own or just leave it as is.  I feel like I am in a Star Wars movie riding in the Millennium Falcon.  It is very easy to assemble, even I did it.  The instructions are clear and concise, so much that even a cave man could do it.  It took me about a half of an hour to put it together.  And get this, the tools supplied are well made as well, no twisting and not stripping of the heads.  Now the comfort, I have noticed that I am no longer sweating on my back like I used to do with my full leather chair.  This has a mesh back, and vented seat to keep you cool and comfortable.  Now not only does it have a lumbar pillow, it has a smaller one for either your head or I have mind just at the base of my head and it is very comfortable.  It's adjustable, even the armrest are adjustable.  Great value for the money.

    Assembly was fairly simple and quick. All hardware and tools were included with the chair. The chair looks nice and is comfortable. 2 levers, 1 to adjust height and another to lock the reclining position. The back mesh is firm and feels supportive. The top part comes with a pillow that is adjustable or removable while the lumbar support pillow is just a freestanding pillow. Lumbar support could be better, but the pillow does offer some support. I changed out the wheels, but no issues with the standard casters. The quality is nice and the adjustable arm rest heights are convenient. Good office chair or gaming chair.

    This OneGame gaming chair is very comfortable, the seat is large and roomy and very soft for those long gaming periods. The arms are adjustable and comfortable. You can lock the back in place so you can sit straight up or release and lean. The head rest is comfortable, it also came with a head cushion that helps in supporting the head when sitting straight up. It has a lumbar pillow which I don't see as needed. It looks good for a gaming chair. Recommended.

    This is a nice chair. Its a little bigger than what I would typically go for, so it would be great for tall people. I was able to assemble it myself, and the wheels glide SO smoothly. The mesh on the back is nice, and the seat is a weird pleather, but its not bad. The chair looks nice, and its a clean white, not a cream or anything. The place where the back attaches to the seat has a cover to hide the components, and I appreciate that attention to detail.

Chair held up and they were very comfortable. The casters work well, it swivels like a champ, and the lumbar support is adjustable so you can move it around to be exactly where you want it, instead of hoping for the best.

    This is a nice mid-level quality gaming chair.  It wasn't too hard to put together as we've now assembled several chairs in our lifetime so you sort of get the hang of how they generally go over time.  I've seen much better wheels than these and can already tell that they are going to get gunked up in the carpet in no time at all.  We'll be looking into our replacement options.  A younger teen is using this chair and they report that the seat is comfortable to sit in.  The 2 moveable cushions are nice as this makes the chair completely adjustable to the person sitting in it.  Teen loves that it reclines way back.  The mesh backing is nice to keep the body from overheating.  All in all, it's a good chair for the price.

    When we received this office chair it came with pillow for the back as well I definitely recommend this office chair very comfortable to sit in. My customers say it look like a storm tropper lol. Very easy to put together.

    Very comfortable. I’m a little short but the headrest is perfect four me.  Most chairs push my head forward but this lines up terrific.

    This is my first brand new game chair and I gotta say, I quite like it. Some of the parts packaging seemed rather thrown together and gave me a chuckle but all in all, it got here undamaged. There were moments when assembling I was skeptical but everything came together just fine, some parts (bolts) needed a little more elbow grease to get in but now I'm positive they won't be coming out any time soon. This chair is pretty darn comfy, bottom cushion, the back it like a hammock over a frame, optional pillow supports (lower back and head/neck), even the arm rests are firm and lightly squishy. The base is made out of solid metal and the back out of sturdy plastic. Overall, solid and comfy, I like this chair. Oh, and the hardware was very neatly organized and directions easy to follow.

    It took roughly 30 minutes to assemble this gaming chair, even though the instructions were quite vague. The chair is incredibly comfortable and quite spacious. In fact, it's larger than my car seats!

    I got this for my son's gaming room and I love this chair! It was so easy to put together and its really comfortable! I could not believe the price on this chair as it is priced great for a gaming chair. The quality is unreal as I have never heard of this brand but I can promise you this chair will last even with an aggressive teen who likes to play online games for hours on end. This chair took about 30 mins together and I love the seat cushion on this chair. The back support is awesome too and it helps when you are sitting for a few hours.

    This computer chair, is comfortable and sturdy. It allows you to recline, and lock in any angle recline that you want. It also allows you to go up and down simply so that you get the right height. It does give you neck and lumbar support cushions that you can adjust.The only problem I had, was, there was one picture in the instructions that wasn’t clear, that connected the back to the seat. Took me about five minutes to figure it out, then it was great! I would definitely recommend.

    Comfortable and stylish. Gaming chair with adjustable back. Easy to put together. Durable, I have my 260 pound son using it, and he is rough on everything. Works great. Can recline to 150 degrees. Would recommend. Comes with pillows for added comfort.

    This gaming chair didn’t take long to put together for me being a single person. It was pretty much straightforward which I like. The gaming chair itself is not the most comfortable for me personally as I like a little bit more cushion but it works. The only thing I would have to say that I’m not totally loving is that the chair itself is able to lean back and lean back it does almost to the point where you can fall if you tip it way back enough. The chair doesn’t have a feature where you can stop it from leaning back a certain degree. It does glide across my hardwood floor pretty well, the little pillow it comes with is a bit hard and does nothing in my opinion. My teen seems to like it though.

    Review for the ""OneGame Video Gaming Chair""I'll start with the things that seem negative.1. The lumbar support is awful, and that included pillow feels very unnatural against my back.2. The head pillow is hard to position with the wideness of the chair, seems like a poor addon.3. There is no spring support when adjusting the angle of reclining.Here are some positives.1. The seat cushion is comfy. (At first I and others did not like it, but it felt better after a few days.)2. It reclines far back which is nice for lounging and watching long form content, or relaxing.3. Assembly was easy.4. It seems very sturdy.I think this is a good chair in some respects, but for the negatives I pointed out. I would not be able to use this as my main chair.

    For the price, I thought this would be more comfortable for long periods. It's nice looking and the embroidery looks amazing. But the seat part is super flat and firm. Which really took a toll on me after a short period.
