    I struggle with airpods and squishy earbuds because they're too big for my ear canals. These have lots of fitting options and I have them in comfortably for hours. The sound is good for a wireless set. They of course won't have the deep bass of a real sound system but it works great for day to day in the office. They are not 100% noise canceling but it's enough I can't hear much. The price tag for such good sound can't be beat. They charge well and the case is very small. A tiny improvement would be if the case had a small bar so they can be attached to keyrings or hooked in a bag. For now they easily slip into a pocket or purse.

    The TOZO A1 Minis are a solid low profile pair of TWS earbuds. They just get the job done. Nothing particularly wrong with them nor spectacular which is fine. If I were to give a rating based on the price I got them at (about 15$ before sales tax) I'd give them 5 stars, but that may not be the case when you the consumer are browsing low budget options for wireless earbuds so I'm critiquing them at their roughly 30$ retail price.The sound quality is solid for the price. The mids are good enough, the bass feels a bit recessed, and the treble can sometimes seem sibilant depending on the song. These issues are further exacerbated the louder you crank up the volume. It's not that bad because there’s way worse sounding TWS buds in this price range, but it's just something worth mentioning. The other thing I'm a bit mixed on is the battery life, but it's another small compromise you have to deal with in this price bracket. It's good enough sort of like how I described the sound quality but I wish the actual listening time was in that 8 hour range alongside the case with maybe an addition 10 hours charge time. But these are a small low profile pair, and the case as well is tiny so it is what it is. 5.3 Bluetooth connectivity is nice though I'll say, have not had connection issues and you can sort of walk around your house with your phone down and not have the audio cut-out.Overall I may came off as a bit negative/dismissive, but I just wanted to give a realistic assessment. Like I said for about 15 bucks if you're able to get it for that price it's nearly a no brainer if your pockets are a bit tight right now. The compromises I mentioned earlier would be mostly negated at that shoestring budget price. Otherwise I'd spend another 15-25 dollars and go up a tier like with the Soundpeats Engine 4.

    I have small ears and the different sized ear adapters that came with it were perfect. The sound is great and they stay in my ears comfortably. I can't figure out all the things they can do, but they have touch controls. The sound is really good for the price point. The case is pretty good, and they keep charge for a long time. I can't wait to try these under my noise cancelling headset I use while mowing this summer. Great buy.

    Not a fan of ""bud"" type headphones and would never consider buying a pair that would cost 100.00 or more, but I have to admit that the A1s are a great set of buds.  For phone calls are pod casts they're great.  Vocals are nice and clear and I've had no issues with the mics.  Clear calling all the way around.  For music, they are lacking in bass, put I've heard far worse.  The bass improves when I press in on them a little, and I found that by putting on the larger ear pieces greatly improved the bass and blocks out a good deal of outside noise.If you're looking for a nice set for a very good price, give the A1s a try.  You'll be surprised and pleased as long as you aren't expecting Bose or  Beats quality.I was impressed enough to upgrade to the T20s for the larger diaphragms.

    I don't understand! I bought a newer version of these ear buds just a couple days ago, yet when I came to review them it brought me into my old review of over a year ago? What's up with that Amazon? Anyway, as you can see below this paragraph is my year-ish ago review. These newer ear buds are far better then the older ones. They have great sound, easy to pair with all my devices (including my gaming PC), and the touch/tap commands are easy to follow - they don't always work, but they're easy to follow. For example, it comes with them set in a ""bell/beep"" type setting for indicating things like connecting, power low warning, etc. The instructions say to tap three times to get it to set to voice prompts (which I prefer, as the first time they ran down on power it was apparently sending me odd beep sounds. I paid the beeps no attention because I thought the beeps were coming from my game. I only figured it out after the buds shut off). So I tapped three times on the right bud - nothing, I tapped three times on the left - still nothing. I tapped 3 times again on the right and heard a beep. Since the instructions don't appear to say what the beeps mean, I have no idea if I was successful. Including even a brief mention of what the beeps mean would get nearly a five star review from me. As it is, I'll just have to wait and see if voice prompts are even possible with these. Just a suggestion, since the previous two types of these ear buds came with voice prompts already set, you might consider making these newer ones also come with voice prompts already set so you don't unnecessarily confuse and thus annoy your repeat customers. Over all, for the price (was on sale for around $15 U.S.) these are pretty good little buds - not the best for sure, but well worth even the normal $30ish they ask at the time of this review.OLD UPDATE: I finally found the brand I had been looking for and bought a second set. The quality is great and the battery life is about eight hours. Even so, this isn't about those ear buds, it's about these TOZO buds. Not long after I left my original review the company reached out to me and presented an offer to make up for my opinion of their ear buds. (My previous review below included only three stars, I would like to note that I know how this update might look considering what follows, but I assure you I am not bought, I speak my real mind in truth. That's just how I was raised. In any case, just read on and decide for yourselves.) They really like their product and wanted a second Chance to get a better opinion from me. Perhaps the pair of ear buds I originally got from them were just a bad set, I don't know. Anyway, they offered to replace the set I bought for free, also they offered a different set for free if I didn't want to try the first set again. I thanked them for the offer, but I found the original brand I'd been looking for (as noted below/above) and didn't need any more ear buds. However, about a week later they again reached out with the same offer adding that they really just wanted to make things right because they work hard to make sure all their customers are satisfied with their products. In truth, it seems their customer care services are very motivated, they do go out of their way to satisfy their customers. By my wife's suggestion I took them up on their offer for a different pair, the TOZO model T9. Instead of being small and hiding in the ear, these have a tail that resembles some Apple brand buds. Once I received them I charged them up and tried them out. They were much better than the first ones I bought, sound quality was very clear, I could even understand the voice in the buds telling me when they were connected. Most impressive though was the length of time the batteries appeared to last, I started using them about 12:30 p.m., and they finally ran out of juice at around 10:30 p.m. That was with non stop use! So I would like to add two things here. First, this company really prides itself on taking care of their customers. Second, I am especially glad my wife talked me into taking them up on their offer, because these second set of ear buds really met the great reviews that convinced me to try these in the first place.(Previous review:)I had bought a different pair for about the same price as these and was so impressed that I decided to buy a second pair. Since I couldn't find the ones I was looking for I decided to try these based on so many positive reviews. After receiving these, charged them up, set them up, used them for roughly four hours and the right ear bud ran out of power fallowed shortly by the left one. The other brand I used might have spoiled me a bit since they easily last a full eight hours before needing recharged. These also do not have the sound quality as my other pair even though they both were under $20. Finally, the announcer on this pair that tells you when you've hooked up to a Bluetooth connection, or when the ear buds need recharged is really hard for me to understand. Sorry but the accent is simply too distorted to make out clearly. I'll use these as an backup set for now, but I'm really going to look harder to find the brand I originally purchased since, for about the same price, they are far superior in every way.Your milage may be better than mine, but I won't be buying these again.

    I needed some earbuds quick like after I couldn't find my trusty buds and I had prime, these were the only available ones for one-day same day shipping, and they used USB-C to charge, and my GF needed a pair as well. And when you type ANC into amazon's search these are the only ones that come up. Should've read the specs a bit harder; that isn't TOZO's fault  just amazon being unfriendly.Anyway, onto the buds:The construction:They are, the definition of mid, meh, whatever. Okay, fine, these are awful-ish? They are super plasticky feeling, not a slippery plastic feeling but these weren't built with quality in mind. They are fine to be honest. The eartips included are those flimsy plastic ones that are always included in cheap-o buds like these. Maybe they are silicone but I couldn't tell that's for sure. They do the job but it could've been done better. The default tips work fine for me but maybe experimenting with the included ones can get me a better seal. The buds themselves feel fine. They are shockingly light so I could see these being an advantage for fitness people who need earbuds that last two hours max for a gym outing. The charging case is where they really cut back. It's not the best built case. If the buds are waterproof the case most definitely is not. Be careful because if you loose the case  you lose the buds anyway. The lid on the case closes with even the slightest of breezes so that WILL annoy you very quickly. See the included  video in this review. When you put the earbuds to charge the lights on the case light up once, and that's it. There's no other activity to indicate the earbuds are being charged so you have to open the case and look at the buds themselves. The buds themselves only have a blue light or red light for charging or something. There's no included instructions on the packaging so you'll have to take your best guess on what that means. Luckily most bluetoth hardware should show the charge on the buds.The sound:These are not your audiophile phones that's for sure. I've messed around with various EQ settings on my phones, PC, laptop, etc. I just can't quite get them to behave right. That being said after walking around and playing music through them while shopping at Costco and such I've been pleasantly surprised at the ability to damped sound. Way better than I expected.Fit:The one part these headphones shine is that they are very comfortable to wear. At no point was I tired of wearing them, they just fit right. They are light and the angle they are built in works for your ear. I've gotta say it's a good design. Wish they had better everything else. If you are the kind that sleeps with earbuds on these may be your ticket.Pairing:Worked just like your standard Bluetooth earbuds. Take them out, check your Bluetooth menu, pair them, and you are done. I should point out the announcer voice is hilariously awful. No multi-device pairing so be careful of that one. These connected to my Samsung phone before my Pixel 4XL (my main phone) for some reason and I was lost for a bit wondering why they weren't connecting. Something to watch out for if you have various Bluetooth devices around you and are wondering why they aren't pairing right.Packaging:Very eco friendly packaging. Everything was cardboard with some kind of eco-friendly foam thing which felt not unlike a dish scrubber. Included was the eartips, a comically small USB-C cable and the buds and case themselves. I have to say, I approve. The less plastic I have to deal with the better.Summary:If I could sum up these earbuds it would be simple:""Great design, decent implementation""It would be nice if Tozo could take this same design and make a better high end version of them.

    UPDATE: My original review complained about the controls, which I found difficult to use initially. After several days, I've gotten better at tapping and holding, and am having greater success in controlling the output. In addition, I switched from Podcast Player to Pocket Casts (on a Samsung phone), and now I'm able to double-tap to go forwards and backwards in the same episode, which is what I really wanted. (I care much less about moving to the next/prior episode).  My only remaining complaint is that whatever I was last playing still starts automatically the second I remove the earbuds from their case. I now just single tap one of them to pause the playback, and then try to screw them into my ears without accidentally starting them up again (and that's hard).However, I feel that for $16, this is now definitely worth 5 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Let me start by saying that these are a good buy. For under $16, I wasn't expecting deluxe earbuds. The sound is fine for podcasts, which is what I listen to.What puzzles me is that everyone else is very happy with the controls, while I find them extremely difficult to use. I have them configured (via the Tozo app) so that one tap on either side should start or stop the podcast. Neither earbud reliably registers the tap every time. Double-tapping the right bud skips to the next episode, and that works OK most of the time. However, double-tapping the left bud, which should go to the previous episode, does not work at all (I've tried it from various places in my queue.). I had to disable triple-tapping on both sides--it's supposed to activate the Voice Assistant--because the buds didn't seem to distinguish between double- and triple-tapping.  Long pressing the buds to change the volume is finicky as well.  And there's no tapping option to skip ahead or go back in the same episode.After spending half an hour testing all the taps and experimenting with different configurations via the Tozo app to see if I could make the taps work better, I gave up, and decided just to use the phone's podcast app for all these functions.The other thing that's weird is that when I take the buds out of their case, they immediately begin to play the podcast that I listened to most recently, EVEN if I  exited the podcast and closed the podcast app (I use Podcast Player) on my phone.  And EVEN though the podcast app is configured to not allow external devices to start playing.  So by the time I get the earbuds out and screwed into my ears, I have to back up 30 seconds to catch what I just missed.So those are my kvetches. Having said all that, they're a good buy for the money. (I'll update this review if they don't last long). And I really appreciate the slick storage/charging case, and the fact that they came with multiple sizes of earbud tips.

    First of all these are my second pair of Tozo ear buds. My last pair lasted many years until the battery gave out after heavy daily use. I was happy with them so I got a new pair from them. Let talk pros.THESE ARE TINY! I was shocked, I knew they were smaller than my old ones but they are almost comical how small they are.Battery life is good. These last easily the advertised 6 hours and from dead the case can charge the buds about 3ish times. Pretty goodUSB C at this price amazing. That's it that's the tweet.Now I'm sure you read the title so let'sntalk the cons and why I'm disappointedBattery life indicator. It does not want to disclose what it's remaining life is. It flashes quickly when putting a bud in and that's it you have to remove and replug the bud to check it. No other way to checkSound quality. These are NOT good as far as base. They are thin and all mids. That said it's not terrible for me as I listen to podcasts so not a deal breaker.The fit. My biggest disappointment. To be clear it's not the buds fault but they hurt my ears. I've tried wearing them several different ways with a few days break in between and several ear tips. They just plain hurt my ears. This is sad because I would tolerate the other cons if not for this.Overall these are great especially for the price. They are good build quality and they are good enough for most people. However I think if you are concerned about them hurting or like more than mids in your ear buds you may want to reconsider. If you need some earbuds you can toss around and won't be too sad if you lose or break them I say go for it. As for me I'm going to clean them and give them to someone as a gift.

    I have been using these now for a little over a week and after testing and having the time to fiddle with them I must say I am very pleased. They come packaged well and the ear buds have a protective barrier over the gold contacts that are used to charge in the charging case which I've never gotten with any head set I've owned (including beats) it made me feel vetter knowing that they didn't get damaged during transit especially given the issues I've had with similar cases and ear buds. The sound quality is superb and comparable to some of the higher priced products out there. Another HUGE plus is the number of ear bud choices and the different shapes. I have smaller ears and smaller ear canals and love that I could choose not only a different sized bud but a different shape. I wind up listening for 10+ hours a day alternating ear pieces as I work outside on residential properties and need to hear while on property and my ears don't hurt. Its the most comfortable head set I've ever owned. I can not recommend these enough. Price low and the quality and value is amazing. Don't miss out on these.

    I am NOT a morning person. Neither is my boyfriend, but his 3 youngest children live with us full time and I am the one who gets up with them every day during the week. (We have all 5 of his kids Friday into Saturday and just the two oldest on Sundays, but Sundays I get up early to spend the day with the little boy I raised, for full context.) My ONLY day to sleep in, whatsoever, is Saturday. Given that the 5-year-old wakes up before the sun on school days, she isn’t any more patient on Saturdays and quite often wakes up everyone else in the house around 4:30/5am. We have FINALLY convinced her to just go sit alone in the living room so everyone else can sleep, but I always hear her (her dad sleeps like a log). Saturdays are the worst because it isn’t just one kid being noisy, it’s 5, plus the dog usually.Needless to say, I almost never get to sleep in. Whether it’s a school day, my Sunday responsibilities, or the kids coming in asking for a snack/a phone to play on (you have a million toys, PLAY WITH THEM!)/to get changed/or any other typical kid request, also god forbid the dog doesn’t get her medication on time or she has an accident because no one let her outside. These babies have saved me. I pop them in when I have my usual 3am wake up for water or the bathroom, turn on some brown noise on Spotify, and their dad has to take care of the morning routine.I can’t hear a THING. It’s great. All 5 of them came in this morning apparently, but I overslept my alarms by 30 minutes! I didn’t hear any whining or fighting, no one asked me for the breakfast I had set out for everyone (just in case their dad didn’t get up, I wanted a little tiny break). He had to field all of their dramas and questions and I just slept. I’m not even sure if these are marketed as noise-cancelling and, if nothing is playing, they aren’t as likely to drown out sounds as some other brands, but with subtle music on, I’m in a completely different world.Thank you for a product that allows me to sleep in at least once a week!BONUS: I can’t hear my boyfriend’s snoring over the music, either. 10/10 recommend.

    I was unsure which earbuds to purchase as I am new to this.  I've heard how great earbuds can be and I have heard bad things as well.  After researching a few different brands and reading a LOT of reviews, (positive and negative), I decided to purchase these.  The reviews were very positive on these earbuds and the company's description about them was very thorough.  I felt this was a brand I could trust as they stand behind their product, so I purchased the TOZO A1 Wireless earbuds.  When they arrived I read through the instructions, charged them fully and then turned on my Bluetooth to my phone then my laptop.  Both connected with ease.  I called my husband with them in and he said it was as if I was talking directly into my phone, he wouldn't have known is was wireless.  They have crystal clear sound.  I watched a movie on my laptop and heard everything clearly.  I would tell anyone not to hesitate as these earbuds are the way to go.  Especially for those like myself who have never used them. I had a few questions and in case you have the same I'm gonna tell ya.  Yes, you can listen to music, or any video, movies as well as use your phone through these little earbuds, they are super light weight, fit comfortably in the ear,. they are packaged in a nice little  box with a quick start guide and user manual, extra silicon earpieces and a charging cord.  The charging case (super compact), that they sit in has a strong magnetic hold (these babies aren't falling out) and charges up super fast and on the quick guide is a QR Code you can scan and get an additional 18 month warranty from the company.  Like I said before, ORDER THESE NOW, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THEM!!!!

    Ok so more detail.I like the price (got it on sale myself) I like the size etc, these things are actually really small and can get lost easy so be sure to get the correct ear tip size when you get them! Infact ive used these while my phone and the case was left in my room while I was in my bathroom brushing my teeth, I even cooked with these in. They have a pretty nice range and don’t seem to drop in quality of sound, I keep my volume at 40-50% these things can also get really loud.My only real dislike.. the ear tips can be difficult to put on! But these come with many sizes and they’re nice.Can’t say how long these may last but I take care of my stuff; will update this post when they break or anything and give when.March 23rd 2024

    So I got these little things a while back and paired them with my Apple Watch cellular. Now they pair with each other and the watch usually within about 7-8 seconds, without you doing anything except take them out of the case. The touch panel works okay. A firm tap should do it. Also I should mention that these come with a lot of different tips to use, but I like to use the small ones. By the way, the charger they come with is a short USB-C type, so if you want to charge them at any distance at all, you'll need a different cord. Not sure how much of a problem that would be since they're so light that I think it's fine to hang them from the cord.Overall:Pairing - 5 starsCharging - 4.5 starsSize - 4.5 stars since they are easily lost and have no tracking that I know of.Ease of use - 5 stars, since they do not fall out of my ears, pair automatically, and have a 4 light indicator that tells you how much the battery of the case has left. Not sure why it doesn't show you that when you open and close the lid or take them out or put them in but the pairing makes up for it.Also as far as I can tell they are not waterproof but I haven't gotten them wet yet.So in conclusion, they are a great little pair of earbuds that were definitely worth the price.

    I purchased these earbuds partly because of their enormous tally of positive reviews which persuaded me to take a chance- of course it's a low cost was the biggest incentive.  Recently I had purchased a pair of Samsung & beats earbuds for work, but had a stretch of bad luck and lost one earbud from each set. So I decided to give these a try until I could figure out what to do about perhaps buying another expensive pair in the future.  Being a huge fan of music, I like to consider myself an audiofile with a taste for very high quality sound for my music. Before I bought this set here on Amazon, I gave another site a try selling a (slightly) used pair of Bose quiet comfort first generation. The sound wasn't that great, and overrated my opinion. But I return them because I couldn't link the pods to my phone. I researched the problem and found other buyers had the same issue, I returned them in the in.  As far as cost, packaging, fit, pairing, operation, these TOZO earbuds are extremely difficult to beat in those regards and receive 10 out of 10 stars in my opinion. But sound quality, I wasn't expecting much and sadly I was right. With bass sounding nearly non-existent It's sound is similar to a 1960s transistor radio. Still, for the price is an excellent buy and a more than decent starter set or for the younger ones in your family.  I won't return these, but I'll keep them as a backup just in case whenever my other earpods need charging.

    I'm a walker, most of the time I wear bandless earmuffs. I purchased these so my earmuffs would go on properly. My other set of earbuds  have bands that go around my ear and I love those and use them at the gym.  My earmuffs don’t fit properly, and so I bought these. The sound  is clear. I have two issues with these, the first is that I can’t answer the phone and end a call as instructed so I use my phone. The other is that they are hard to remove from the case. I recently had my kids over and informed them of this so I wanted to be fair so we all tried to remove them from the case and two of the five of us had issues with removing them, the rest had no issue.

    My air pods gave up on life and I can’t afford new ones for a while. These are pretty comfortable and come with 4 size options. Battery lasted at least 6 hours on and off. Sound quality is okay even at max volume. They come with a charging case and a short (4-6in) charging cable.They do NOT automatically disconnect when in their case. I have to disconnect in settings to use my phone or listen/watch without headphones. Not noise canceling (I don’t think it said they were but it’s kind of jarring if you’re going from AirPods to these).I’ve had them 2 weeks with no issuesIn a pinch I’d get them again and I’m happy with my purchase so far.

    I picked these up because my old ones had a battery that only lasted about a year.  My wife used these and on her recommendation, I picked up a set for myself.  The noise canceling is very good, the audio quality excellent, and the battery life (depending on use) can be up to two days.  Overall I'm very happy with these, except that I'm used to tapping to raise or lower the volume.  Unless you have both in your ear, you have to use your device to raise or lower.  The only other issue I have is that you have to download the app to set what the various taps do.  Otherwise, very good product at a great price.

    So far so good, they seem to stay in my ears which is good because most earbuds don't, I just have wonky ear canals I suppose. I haven't used them while working out or walking yet so I don't have a comment on that, what I can say is that they synced up to my phone nicely and were a great price, I bought two because of that, I have no problem with the charging case, these seem to be a good, basic pair of wireless earbuds for someone like me, woman in her 50's, just looking to have some genX music playing here and there in life, I wouldn't know about bass or sound quality and don't really care, they do the job just fine.

    Sound quality is great and controls are easy to use! The app is great too because you can change some settings like EQ there. The downside is that the silicone ear pieces it comes with are very small. The largest one is probably closest to a size medium. They provide 5 sizes to try but they are all smaller than the default ones that come already attached. They are continually falling out of my ears while working at my desk job. I have not even tried to do any kind of exercise with them in.You can also tell from the pictures that there are clearly two different manufacturers of the silicone pieces they provide. The default ones are far right in the picture if that helps.

    I use Bluetooth on every device including the computer, I'm often communicating through programs like telegram and/or doing YouTube videos. I could not find a set of headphones Bluetooth that recorded audio while at the same time recording my voice, until this set. I have literally tried 8 different versions of different Bluetooth that claim they could do the same thing and none of them did, a lot of frustration and a lot of returns. This 1, I've only had it for a day, but already I've completed a 2 hour telegram conference call and have communicated on the phone and not a single person is made a single complaint nor have I had a single issue, so yes I would recommend it.

    These headphones have great sound quality for the price. They also come with a few different sizes for the pieces that go in your ear, so it's easy to find a size that works for you. I have seen plenty of headphones that only come with 3 sizes, including the ones that are already on the headphones, but these ones came with 5. I always struggle finding headphones that stay in my ears without creating a pocket of pressure behind them. My ears are very sensitive, so most headphones hurt my ears, but these ones are great.  I wouldn't say these are the best headphones I've ever had, but for the price, they are great.

    I love these earbuds. I have bought multiple pairs (not because of the product not working, but because I accidently crushed one pair when lowering my car seat 🙃, although while the case no longer works for that pair, the earbuds themselves still stay strong as I charge them with my current case. You can use them individually or both at the same time with no problem. After a couple months, the magnet did start to have a problem and cane off when I opened the case. I put a small piece of tape to hold it in place and it works perfect. You can't any tell! (This is also probably because I am a little rough with them) I definitely regiment getting a pair. I also once lost one and just played a video really loud out of them and heard it from upstairs, I was very impressed.

    I liked these because they were inexpensive and I needed a pair of earbuds.They are worth the price. They charge fast, about 3 hours or so from dead to full.However they only hold a 3.5 hour playtime charge. Straight out of the box, first fully charge to empty, 1 earbud at a time. 3.5 hours. 1 year later. Still 3.5 hours playtime. That's lousy.Otherwise the sound is decent and the noise cancellation is decent. Not bad at all.Except for the playtime. I have to swap them out several times during an 8 hour shift.

    i did a lot of reading reviews on amazon before purchasing these and i have to agree with the majority: these are truly superior for such a low price. the app offers a lot of extra features. but they're also very simple.. one tap to play/stop, one tap to answer the phone. no problems at all with phone calls. they're small and fairly discreet.the price point was a big factor in choosing these and the sound quality and noise cancellation are truly better than more expensive ones. i'd give them 6 stars for exceeding expectation. tozo seems to be a really good brand.love being able to have both buds in and just get immersed in some good music. it's trippy if you have the right sort of lettuce to mix with it.

    Bought this as an addition to an expensive headphone so that I could use while exercising. The quality of the audio is clear and works well. Recently, the left and right headset started functioning in a way where I could connect the right to a different phone and left to another phone via Bluetooth…call it feature or bug..I leave it to you…but I could not connect both to one single phone.The reported the issue to the manufacturer and within 12 hrs, they provided a way to reset the Bluetooth and make both the left and right headset work simultaneously.

    I wasn't expecting much at this price point, and with no EQ adjustment, the sound was very tinny. After upping the bass and lowering the 2k range - wow! Got about 5 hours of continuous use today (mostly music) before a recharge was needed. These are my 1st Bluetooth earbuds, so the only thing I can compare them to are the wired headphones and earbuds, many of which were ""studio monitor"" quality. These come very close and are a lot more comfortable to wear throughout the day. Will see how long they last!

    I am really impressed with this buy so far. (I just got it)It was well priced and I was pleased to see the beautiful professional packaging. The sound is nice and loud and it comes with different sized rubbers so you can be sure that it’ll fit. I am very impressed by how light they are compared to my JBL Vibe in-ear headphones which I sadly lost (thus why I bought these)I have TOZO over-ear headphones too and they are also great, so I might have a new favorite brand!

    Okay I have had these for about a week and am ready to review them after running them every day with a lot of music of various genres.In this review I am comparing them to the TOZO T12, which are supposed to be TOZO's better pair.The sound of the A1 isn't amazing, but it is clear enough and represents the entire range in a very nice and clean way from mids to highs, although the highs may be slightly cut off. The staging is somewhat poor but that is sort of to be expected, it is a true left/right experience with little depth yet good sound. Battery life so far has been okay enough for me, although I wish they lasted 10 hours so they could be used through a full shift.Compared against the T12, the T12 wins in the sound department. The bass is punchier, there is more separation in instruments, and the overall sound is wider and more 'open,' although overall the t12 is still quite closed. The t12 clearly sound slightly better.Yet between the two I would choose the A1's over Tozo's other offerings. Why? The bliss of silence. The T12 hiss quite bad in the ears, making them very bad for audiobooks. Now these A1 minis? Not only are they vastly more comfortable due to their size, they are COMPLETELY SILENT when not playing music, and when voices are talking there is NO HISSING or white noise. That is what makes these actually quite amazing for the price, and it's really sad that TOZO's more expensive earbuds all hiss in your ears. Go with these, and if you need more battery life just get two pairs in different colors (so you don't mix them).These earbuds are great.

    Overall, I am very happy with these earbuds. I liked the following points:-They provide great sound quality.-Call come through crystal clear.-Holds a charge well.-Love that I have color choices.-The “insert and twist” to fit in the ear takes some getting used to, but was not very difficult. It gave me a feeling of security that they wouldn’t be falling out of my ears.-Pairing with my phone was a breeze.-I still use my phone to pick up calls rather than touching the earbuds, but that’s just my preference.My only and biggest gripe is that I wish there was a way to adjust the bass down, as I listen to a lot of audio books and symphonic music, using more treble.Aside from that, I have purchased a set for my friend, and plan to purchase a couple more sets for gifts.Suggestion:It would be really nice if there was some sort of loop for a carabiner or key ring on the case. Or maybe link a compatible case cover? They are inexpensive enough to replace, but I would prefer not to misplace them if possible.

    These obviously aren't going to be the best earbuds, but they are AMAZING for someone looking for a cheap option that gets the job done. They're really good quality for the price. Mine came with a few different sized ear insert things (the little rubber thing that goes in your ear that you attach to the earbuds). They were a bit difficult to change out though, and some of them seemed like they weren't even meant for these headphones. The tap function is good. I haven't tested out the phone call feature yet, but there are instructions in the little manual it comes with. The battery life is pretty long, so depending on how often you use these earbuds, you can go weeks without recharging the case. They fit comfortably into the ear. I don't know much about sound, but so far these are pretty good. They're definitely not noise-cancelling, but I wasn't really looking for that. I also like how many color options there are.

    I got this item today and I was skeptical as I’ve brought several of these ear buds from other companies even Apple but let me tell u when I opened the cover they did connect automatically. They stay in ur ears so securely once u read the instructions which way they’re supposed to be worn.  I jumped around dancing and not once did they fall out. All the features worked as stated and the bass is incredible.  The volume was so loud my phone asked me to turn it down.  I would definitely buy these again and plan to buy more for gifts.  First inexpensive ear buds I bought that actually work.

    The earphones were in very nice packaging. When I opened the box I enjoyed the styrofoam placing for the ear one’s charging box. It all looked neat and they came with extra earbuds. I tried them on and their very light weight at hardly noticeable inside the ear so that is very convenient. I tried them out and the sound was of good quality, the pairing is nice too and easy too. It’s only a 9/10 because I’m not used to earbuds so they were a bit funky at first but after getting used to them they’re a 10/10.

    I love these little guys. I bought them in November 2022. It's March 2024 and they're still going strong.  Now I don't use them everyday, just when I travel via planes and cruise ships 5-6 times a year. But the point is they've been dependable when I pull them out to use. I'm not an audiophile, I just want to hear my games, music and videos clearly and loud enough to block out surrounding noise. These work great for that.

    I use them 99% for listening to audio books. They are perfect for that. Fit well, look like they are constructed well, and voice audio on them is very clear.I tested on some music, and found the low end, maybe even the mid-low end pretty lacking. Would do in a pinch.For $20 though... that's makes these a deal!  If you want great sound for music, I don't think you can get that with even wired headphones that have no BT or battery!

    The ear buds are a slippery texture and paired with their smaller size makes them so hard to get out of the case (and I have small hands!)Battery life is great, and they do fit in my ears nicely and don’t fall out. Would recommend the larger size though, this “mini” size just isn’t worth the money.  I have the larger version and they are fantastic.

    Desde hace tiempo tenía la intención de comprar unos auriculares Bluetooth, aunque ya había comprado otros, siempre había sido para mis hijos, el último que tuve de uso personal era con cable, de modo que tomé la decisión de comprar estos.Había realizado una compra de otros artículos y quería completar el monto mínimo para obtener el envío gratis, decidí darme la oportunidad de comprar estos auriculares luego de haber leído algunas reseñas donde lo valoraban con buena calificación, mis expectativas no eran muy altas debido al precio, me llamó la atención que traían varias almohadillas para ajustarse a los oídos y garantizar un mejor ajuste, cuando recibí el paquete me gustó que se adhieren a la base con imán. la calidad del audio es buena, decente, acorde a su precio, el micrófono recoge muy bien Nel sonido, en ocasiones he estado conversando por llamada con mi esposa y se han generado sonidos que se encuentran distantes a mí y ella los capta perfectamente, así que considero que el micrófono está por encima del precio. algo que me llamó la atención es el alcance de conectividad que tienen estos auriculares, tengo una bocina Bluetooth la cual solía utilizar para comunicarme y en ocasiones dejaba el teléfono en la oficina y cuando salía de la oficina y me moví hacia el pasillo, sin poder alejarme mucho empezaba a fallar la conectividad, con estos auriculares me puedo distanciar aún más, he podido ir de una habitación hacia la siguiente habitación paralela al lado he dejado mi celular en una habitación y he podido mantener la comunicación sin problemas desde la otra habitación sin interferencias. me gusta mucho que tiene un indicador del nivel de batería en la cajita de carga, también me gusta que puedo ver el nivel de carga desde mi teléfono y que tienen magnetismo para pegarse una a la otra.Así que, si estás interesado en comprar unos audífonos Bluetooth muy discretos, que casi no se notan en tus oídos, que tiene varias alternativas de almohadillas para ajustarse a tus oídos, que tiene buen alcance por lo que puedes distanciarte de tu dispositivo y no perderás la comunicación a una distancia razonable, que podrás utilizar los en llamadas telefónicas garantizándote una comunicación cómoda y sin distorsiones, y si no quieres invertir mucho dinero en esto, definitivamente este es tu producto.Un detalle importante es que la duración de la batería no es exagerada, pero si tiene muy buenas prestaciones, no he podido realizar mediciones muy precisas pero en notado que si empieza utilizarlo con un nivel de batería del 100% a las 12 del mediodía y le doy un uso intensivo y continúa escuchando música, realizando llamadas telefónicas, he podido superar las cuatro horas Y el nivel de batería permanecer en un 50%, por lo que asumo que podría brindar prestaciones para unas ocho horas de uso sin mayores complicaciones, claro manteniendo un nivel de volumen moderado. En cuanto a la intensidad del volumen aún no lo he probado a su punto máximo pero los graves o bajos no son muy potentes, sin embargo los agudos se escuchan muy bien.

    Ordinarily I don't like ear buds (I have smaller ears) but these are the first pair I've had that I can wear through an 8 hour workday with no issue/pain. They're very light and comfortable. I'm not a sound snob so they quality is solid imo, great for music and podcasts. Admittedly I've not used them for phone calls or the microphone but setting them up and figuring out the touch commands was super easy. Defo recommend as something to keep in an office, gym bag, ect.

    The sound quality is great, it always connects quickly, they have lasted me years and have definitely been abused. I was hit by a car on my dirt bike and the earbud case took my entire weight during the fall, but fell out of my pocket due to my ripped pants. I found the case 2 days later on the roadside covered in scratches and the buds still worked and charged! I frequently use them for hearing protection too and they work surprisingly well.

    Who knew they could write instructions in a font so small that the characters look like distorted periods, even with a magnifier? And what does “Tap L/R” mean? Tap L OR R? Tap L AND R simultaneously? But all buds struggle to encode 10 functions with two touch controls. (Tap L hold R while squeezing nose.) But the sound is great, connection range very good, and external sound exclusion excellent. I wouldn’t wear these while driving: might not hear a siren. I’m happy I bought these A1s, good value.

    I use it at work to listen to audiobooks or music and it works pretty well. The sound is good, but the charge only lasts about 4-6 hours. I’m charging it on my breaks for about 10 minutes twice a workday and it gets me through the day just fine doing that. Also, if you move your head to much they will start to loosen from your ear and may fall out. Would buy again if needed

    It's nice. I like how simple and easy it is - when you put it back to the case it auto charges and turns off, which is nice.The only downside is that there's this mold like smell from the case, the earbuds, and the packaging. I asked for a replacement and unfortunately it is the same issue for the replacement box. I used the disinfectant wipe hoping that will take out any chemical smell or residue, but the smell is persistent.

    I spend about two hours every night feeding community cats and I like to listen to videos or music while I'm feeding them. I lose my earbuds on a regular basis so I try to buy decent, no frills, inexpensive earbuds so losing them won't be a big deal. I had been maintaining two pairs of earbuds so I would have a pair to use while I was inevitably searching for the first pair that. After I managed to lose both pairs of earbuds I looked for good, inexpensive replacement earbuds. I've had a few Tozo earbuds in the past and I liked them so, when I found these Tozo earbuds priced at only about $20, I bought them.I use only one earbud at a time so I can hear things going on around me. That single earbud has to be loud enough for me to hear the program I'm listening to and the sound has to be clear. These are definitely no frills earbuds but they're loud and clear enough that I can hear my programming clearly even when there's a lot of traffic and other noise around. They're also small enough that they're not immediately visible. The light slate blue color helps too.I only miss one thing with these earbuds; they don't show the charge level of the individual earbuds when I put them in the case. The charge lasts a long time so I can live without knowing the earbuds' charge level. I've had these earbuds for just under a month and I've charged them 3 times, the initial charge when I first got them, a second time around two weeks after I got them, and a week or so later just to top them off.All in all, I'm very happy with these earbuds, although I might buy earbuds with an indicator showing the charge level of each earbud next time. I would recommend these earbuds if you're looking for inexpensive straight forward, no frills, good sounding earbuds.

    I use this head phone at least 5 days a week for about 8 hours a day. I use one and when it dies I switch to the other one and repeat. This is the second pair I own. The first has lasted over a year and still works the only problem is that the left one only last about an hour while the right will last for about 4 hours. Great pair for the price would strongly recommend.
