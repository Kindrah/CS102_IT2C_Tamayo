    I'm absolutely delighted with this paper! Whether I'm printing reports or flyers, the quality and brightness make everything look top-notch. Plus, the bulk pack means I don't have to worry about running out anytime soon. I wrote the date on the box when we opened our last case and the last one lasted exactly 3 years for our family.  A solid choice for anyone who needs reliable, everyday paper!PROS- Versatile: Works great with all my devices - printer, copier, and fax.- Quality: The smooth 20 lb weight paper ensures even ink distribution and vivid color prints.- Bright and Crisp: The 92 bright white paper makes all my documents look sharp and professional.- Economical: Getting 4000 sheets in one go offers fantastic value for money.CONS- Bulkiness: The whole case is a bit heavy, but that's expected with 4000 sheets!

    I recently purchased the Amazon Basics Multipurpose Copy Printer Paper and I am extremely impressed with the quality. This paper is perfect for all my printing needs, whether it be documents for work, school assignments, or even creative projects at home. The 20 lb weight is just right – sturdy enough to hold up well during printing and handling, but not too thick that it jams my printer. The 92 bright white color is vibrant and really makes my text and images stand out on the page.With 1500 sheets in 3 reams, this pack is an excellent value. I never have to worry about running out of paper in the middle of a project. The paper feeds smoothly through my printer every time, without any issues. I appreciate the consistency and reliability of this product.Not to mention, the price is fantastic for the quality you receive. I have purchased more expensive printer paper in the past that did not perform as well as this Amazon Basics paper. I love that I can trust the Amazon Basics brand to provide high-quality products at affordable prices.Overall, I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase of the Amazon Basics Multipurpose Copy Printer Paper. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable, affordable, and high-quality option for their printing needs. Thank you, Amazon Basics!

    Folks, gather 'round! If you are in the market for some great quality printer / copy paper, you have come to the right place. I've embarked on a Copy Paper Odyssey, and I've just returned from a thrilling adventure with this AmazonBasics Bright Multipurpose Copy Paper! You know you're in for a wild ride when 10 reams of paper show up on your doorstep. lolFirst of all, let me say, this paper is so bright it practically has its own tan lines. Seriously though, this copy paper is as described for brightness and I am very satisfied with it.Let’s talk texture here. Who knew paper could be so velvety smooth? It’s as smooth as a new puppy’s soft tummy. Now that’s smooth.I decided to put this paper through some tests, and wow, did it perform! I printed out my meticulously crafted masterpiece—a recipe for homemade peanut butter dog biscuits. Julia Child would have been so proud.But it's not just about the looks; it's also about the durability. I accidentally spilled my iced tea (the hazards of working from home with two Border Collies and two cats), and I was ready to mourn the loss of my precious dog biscuit recipe. But guess what? The paper didn't flinch! It absorbed that iced tea like a champ, and my doggie biscuit recipe remained unscathed. Crisis averted.Now, let's talk quantity. Ten reams of paper may sound excessive, but trust me, it's a game-changer and you save money by buying a case like this rather than one ream at a time. It comes with a heavy duty box with lid that you can keep your reams of paper in so it basically comes with it’s own storage solution. I enjoy putting my favorite recipes on Google Docs and when I want to cook or bake something, I print out the recipe which is easier than trying to see it on my phone with my poor old eyes. I also use this copy paper in my business and print out orders so I use my printer every day and even though ten reams will last me quite a long time, I like not having to worry about running out.In conclusion, AmazonBasics Bright Multipurpose Copy Paper deserves a standing ovation. It's like having a party in your printer every time you hit that ""Print"" button. It's smooth, bright, and as dependable as a dog’s ball throwing routine. So, if you want to elevate your paper game, grab these 10 reams of printer paper awesomeness and let the good times roll!I have been using copy / printer paper for decades and I have been disappointed with the quality in the past. I took a chance on the Amazon Basics brand thinking because it was called “Basic” it might be lower quality but I was pleasantly surprised, it’s really great paper for the price and the “name”.Five stars, without a doubt!

    This is a decent quality paper to use for printing of documents at a relatively inexpensive cost compared to some papers out there.  I like the paper weight and brightness.  The paper itself has a sort of glossier look to it.  It reminds me of more of paper made for a laser printer than paper made for ink jet printers, but being multi purpose paper, it does work fine with ink jet ink.  Smearing of. ink has never been in issue.  The paper feeds pretty well when printing - on occasion, an extra blank sheet may feed through during printing, though it usually does not mean a page prints half on one sheet and half on another - rather, it just means an extra fully  blank page might show up in the middle of a document if you do not check beforehand.  I have an HP inkjet printer/scanner combination printer.  Where this paper is more problematic than others is if/when I try and feed it through the auto feeder of the scanner.  It will jam alot of the time.  I know that part of that is due to my specific scanner/printer I have now, because my old scanner/printer never had the problems with paper jams this one has always had.  That being said though, if I run say Hammerhill Copy Plus paper through the scanner auto document feeder, the paper jams will definitely be less often than if it was this Amazon multipurpose paper running through the document feeder, which can be downright frustrating to do - to the point I oftentimes will end up scanning the entire document by hand page by page on the scanner glass instead.  If you do a lot of scanning of your printed documents, I would highly recommend you try a single ream of this paper first, to see how it works with your particular scanner before purchasing this paper in bulk, but for just printing, it is a good choice.  And for many people, it probably is fine too, as I do think my printer/scanner is largely responsible for the paper jams I experience with this paper.

    I used to always go to the brick and mortar stores to buy paper but slowly the price has gotten too much. I ordered this paper online to see the quality because its cheaper in price. It does what its supposed to do. I dont notice a difference in quality and for the cheaper price I will definitely order again

    What a good deal! I was tired of storing a ton of paper from another store so I though I’d try this because it ships directly to me and three reams is relatively easy to find a place for. Great quality paper for printing and kid drawings/crafts. I just purchased my second case of it. I think I’ll be permanently switching to this one!

    Not really much you can say in regards to this product. I needed printer paper at a reasonable price and not having an office supply close I turned to Amazon for my needs. The paper is neither too thin or two thick and in using it for my ink jet printer did a good job.

    If you want to take your enemies, grind up their body and print to do lists on it, this is the product for you. That is if your enemy are trees!! This paper works great, you can write on it, print your boarding passes, hell you can even use it to catch spiders!!

    We are a sign company that runs a small print division - so we order small batches of paper (unlike full time small format printers.) After the consolidation of the paper mills, it's takes an act of congress and a large order to get paper delivered to your door unless you go through Amazon or similar retailers.They sell this stuff by the pallet too. And guess what? It's so close to the same price they would have to price it by tenths of a cent. So you're basically getting small quantities for a bulk price.In case you were still wondering, this paper prints well. Definitely great for what we need when we're making copies or supplying low cost printing. And that's why they call this line Amazon ""Basics."" If you're looking for premium paper you can get that on Amazon too.

    There's nothing special about this paper. It's just basic everyday multi-use white paper. I use it in my laserjet color printer for printing all kinds of documents. If you're worried about it not being a bigger named brand, don't be. It arrived perfectly intact, all pages were nice and crisp with no blemishes. I took off one star because it didn't have the lowest price of all the options, but the paper itself is just as good as others of the same type weight/brightness.
