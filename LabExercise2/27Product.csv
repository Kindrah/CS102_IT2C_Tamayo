    I bought this in 2017. It is now 2020. I am still using it. It still works as well as the day I got it.Left button still clicks. Right button still clicks. Scroll wheel still scrolls. Side buttons still work. Except in some situations, namely certain games that I'm pretty sure don't accept extra mouse button inputs anyway. For example, in Deus Ex Human Revolution, Bioshock, and Starcraft 2 they don't work, but in Fallout: New Vegas, Metro 2033, and Dota 2 they work perfectly. Seems more a problem with the games themselves than with the mouse. Regardless, their primary function, to go forward and backward on most web pages, still works fine. I use it regularly- Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, even gaming apps like Steam, Origin, Battlenet, and Gog- it's a great unexpected utility. It's easy not to click them if you don't want to unless you have fat thumbs or a lack of muscle control; luckily I have neither but YMMV. It's a hardy piece of hardware. In the games I mentioned above, you need to do a lot of clicking. A lot. Honestly I've clicked it so many times that sometimes my fingers get tired (especially in RTS/Moba which take a LOT of clicking) but the mouse still clicks. It's been three years, I must have clicked hundreds of thousands of times if not millions, and it Still. Keeps. Clicking. Granted I keep it clean and pristine and don't let it get gummed up with cheeto dust or bbq seasoning but it should go without saying that you take care of your electronics or they don't work as well later.The weight and the DPI adjustments are functional, I just don't use them. I removed the weights because they bothered me bu hey they're removable so no harm no foul. Some certain games with messed up mouse acceleration or weird sensitivity input (looking at you, Dead Space) do require a DPI adjustment. There's only 3 tiers which is meh but it's better than none or having 3 million tiers. The lasers are incredibly functional on a variety of surfaces and the material is smooth enough that many surfaces can be used well. Mattress, mousepad, desk, a pair of jeans, I'm honestly shocked how well it works on different materials. The cord has frayed slightly over the years but that's mostly because in my setup, the cord wraps around my external speakers to plug into my computer, and it seems to have only frayed where it rubs up against the speaker. Even then, only a few strands pop out, and the cord itself is still in great condition. The black and red color palette is inoffensive and helps to see where it is in the dark. And the design overall is pretty sleek and cool. My hand is perfectly sized for the hardware so if your hand is the size of my hand (I have hands of fairly average size) you won't have an issue. I can't speak on battery life because it has a cable.Essentially this is baby's first gaming mouse. It's pretty much right in the middle between a practical one typically used for web browsing etc, and a pure gaming one which, well, is used primarily for playing video games. It's enough that I can use it for both activities without encountering any problems. I have to use it in the correct USB slot or I'll encounter problems, but that shouldn't come as a shock to anybody who knows basic electronics. I trust Redragon brand enough that when I buy a keyboard and replacement mouse (if this one ever breaks) it'll be them. Thanks for three years of a good mouse Redragon; here's to three more.

    Like most products from Redragon, this mouse ticks all the boxes when it comes to features, usability and comfort!The comfort of this mouse is very good! It's large enough to fit in the hand without being too large and has enough weight without being too heavy.The sensor is very precise and the DPI selection is on par with what one would expect from a higher priced model from another manufacturer.The RGB aspect is varied enough to be fun and customizable enough to satisfy anyone's needs. If you don't want any lighting, there is an easy option to turn the lights off, and of course the mouse remembers your setting selection when power cycled or unplugged.The button selection is excellent and the button clicks are solid as usual.As this is a wired mouse, one can expect the usual quality cloth braided cable to be long and flexible.Over all, an excellent offering from Redragon! Whether you are looking for a mouse for gaming or for desktop use, you will not be disappointed with this Ranger model!

    ***UPDATE on 5/24/2015***After having had this mouse for some time, I'd like to elaborate on some of the points I made about the mouse.First, the weight of the mouse.  Now that I have gotten used to this mouse, the weight is perfect.  Remember, I was coming from a very heavy R.A.T. 7 mouse that made me feel a bit shocked by how light this one is.  This mouse feels great and, not that the mouse is the ONLY reason, but I did manage to get from Silver Elite Master to DMG on CS:GO playing with this mouse and will not doubt hit The Global Elite down the road a bit.  The mouse is very ""grippy"" in my hands and this is very important, for instance, when you are zoomed in with a sniper rifle awaiting an enemy coming into your view from around a door or corner.  Using more of a claw grip in these instances allows me a ridiculous amount of control over my crosshair movement (in other words, I can accurately move the mouse just a sliver in any given direction).  A big part of this is probably due to the quality of the laser mouse in combination with my sensitivity settings (which for CS:GO are: 1.5 sensitivity, 0.80 scoped in sensitivity, Raw Input = on, and my Windows sensitivity is on the middle tick mark with acceleration off).The buttons have held up superbly.  They are still very responsive, especially with their ""clicky"" feedback.  Of special note is the mouse wheel.  The rubber ""tire"" like covering on it works great and the down-click motion is direct and not sloppy.  You know how some mouses, when you try to click the middle-mouse button, cause you to slip off the wheel or not be able to click it effortlessly?  I haven't ran into that issue yet with this mouse.Still happy with this purchase and I really cannot find a reason NOT to give it 5 stars.  It looks cool, functions great, and has had very little issues.With that said, I am giving it 4 stars due to a driver issue and computer sleep mode issue.  Whenever I put my computer to sleep and then wake it back up, I have to unplug and then re-plug the mouse to get Windows to recognize it.  I Googled this issue and nothing that would indicate it being anything else but this mouse.  My other mice don't have that issue and neither do my other USB devices.Also, I downloaded a driver/software for this mouse from the manufacturer's web site (if I recall correctly) and this caused my mouse to randomly click every few minutes.  During a match in CS:GO, you could imagine how this could really mess things up (sniping, defusing a bomb, maintaining stealth, having a grenade out).  After uninstalling the software, the mouse went back to normal.GET THIS MOUSE!  It really is an amazing value and I'd pay more than I did for it.  I got this for about $17 with Prime shipping.  I would easily have paid $25-30 knowing what I do now.***END UPDATE***Appearance:This mouse looks great, in my opinion.  It has a very aggressive look, and the pairing of a red and black color scheme is a nice touch.  The color LEDs appear on the back of the mouse and both sides which add a very coll effect.  Additionally, the side thumb buttons and the thumb rest are textured and/or slotted for design and grip.  SCORE: 9/10 for appearance.Build quality:So far, the mouse is holding up well.  There is a non-rubberized coating that is more like a matte finish on the main body of the mouse.  This seems to be slip resistant and helps with grip.  The buttons are very ""clicky"" which is great.  I play CS:GO a lot, and I had an issue with my R.A.T. 7 where it felt as if some of the buttons were a bit mushy.  I immediately noticed the difference with the buttons of this mouse and love the switches that the buttons use.  The mouse, overall, feels like it will hold up structurally for some time, and all of the pieces look well-finished and put together.  The braided cable tells me they went the extra mile to make sure this mouse delivers.  SCORE: 9/10Feel:This is the big category for me.  The mouse feels very light, even with the weights inserted into the chassis.  It feels light enough that I almost wish it were just a tad bit heavier, but this could merely be just personal preference.  One other complain I have is the feel of the thumb rest.  It is a piece of textured plastic (which seems like good quality nonetheless).  My gripe is that it would be nice to have something a little ""grippier"" or ""rubbery"" there to make my thumb feel a little more like part of the mouse.  Although, I must say that I enjoy the slotted thumb rest and it seems to help with keeping my hand/thumb cooler.The buttons feel great and responsive.  Not spongy at all.  I love the crisp ""click"" that this mouse has on all of the buttons.  There is only one button to change the sensitivity, so it would have been nice to have another one to change it the opposite way.  In CS:GO, I like to down my sensitivity depending on what weapon I am using, and it can be tedious to have to click 3 times on one button to cycle the sensitivity back to my original one.  The mouse wheel is extra wide which is amazing.  The rubber grip on it ensures that you don't slip when using the scroll wheel.Lastly, this mouse's light weight feeling also gives it a feeling of being ""cheap.""  I do not look at this mouse as being cheap at all, but more like a very good value for what you get.  With that said, maybe it is just me and a heavier weighted mouse would make that feeling go away.  The low weight, however, makes it every easy to move the mouse a tiny distance on screen.  Which leads me to the mouse feet.  My R.A.T. 7 felt like it would jump around a bit when I would try to move my crosshair a tiny distance.  I think this was a combination of the mouse feet and the wide, wide design of the mouse.  This mouse has NO issue with tiny movements and I feel like I can manipulate the mouse very easily and securely.  SCORE: 9/10Value:Cannot beat the value.  I paid 17.00 with overnight Prime shipping for a 6-button, braided cable, laser mouse with adjustable sensitivity and awesome button switches.  I cannot find a good reason to use my other mice over this one.  SCORE: 10/10Overall Score: 9.25/10I would highly recommend this to anyone.  The price is low enough that you have no reason to have it, even as a backup mouse.  Some mice are good for certain things, so if you find that you don't need your ultra-hyped, overrated $75 mouse, give this one a try.  I would buy it again and will now look at Redragon's other products (such as their keyboards).

    The Redragon M601 is a mouse for the casual, penny-saving gamer. It has a unique design, is made of sturdy material, and has a decent amount of adjustability, all the while brandishing a price of lower than $15. There are very few alternatives out there that you could find that include all of the features of the M601 at such a low cost.Design and ComfortAside from the cost, the design and comfort of the M601 was the main selling point of the product. The design of the M601 is rather unique in that, instead of having rounded edges all around the mouse, it has pointed edges at the front which gives it the look of a dragon's claw. This coupled with the glowing Redragon icon at the base of the mouse gives the whole thing a sense of fantasy created around the Redragon name. But the design is used for more than just creating a fantasy around the product. The pointed edges towards the front of the mouse are slightly raised up on the sides which creates an indent in the middle of the mouse buttons where your fingers can rest comfortably. The edges are used as a way to guide your fingers into the middle of the left and right mouse buttons which makes it easy and comfortable for your fingers to rest and click on the middle of the buttons where it is easiest to get a response. Overall, the design of the mouse creates the experience of guiding a dragon's claw while simultaneously creating a comfortable mouse to rest your hands on.DurabilityAfter just over six months of continual use, there has been no noticeable degradation in my M601. The M601 is made of very sturdy materials and has a tight constitution meaning that there are no loose parts or buttons flopping around when the mouse gets moved from one place to another. Each click of the mouse is distinct and responsive. The cord is about 6 feet long and braided the whole way.PerformanceThe actual performance of the mouse is solid. The changeable DPI button works perfectly with its three adjustable setting. The two side buttons work as intended and the mouse's optical sensor is very responsive. The only stumble in performance that has been shown is this weird bug where if the computer is ever put to sleep then started back up again, the mouse will not work. The simple solution to this problem is just simply to unplug and plug back in mouse. This bug does not happen if you shut down or restart the computer, it only ever happens when the computer is put to sleep. It is a simple problem with an easy solution.Overall, this mouse is great for a casual gamer. It gives the perks of high end costing mice, like the adjustable DPI and durable construction, while also holding the cost of a low end mouse. If you are a casual gamer looking for a new, adjustable mouse while also looking to keep your wallet intact, this is the mouse you are looking for.

    You don't really appreciate something as simple as a product working the way it should and working incredibly well until you get a bad product. I originally bought a black with blue lights gaming mouse from another maker that had over 1500 reviews with a 4-star rating for a few dollars cheaper and I absolutely regretted it. That other brand was the Tecknet M268 black mouse with blue lighting didn't feel at all right in my hand. The plastic had no real texture to it and actually felt cheap and somewhat thin and brittle. Worst part was the cursor tracking. Trying to click on the X of a web page or a window was a nightmare. The cursor was jumpy and unstable and playing games on a 2560x1440 resolution screen where everything you needed to click on was tiny was impossible. I tried using different mouse pads and surfaces and nothing made it better. I had to return that and I'm glad I did.My new Redragon Centrophorus is the complete opposite of the other brand's. Here are the points of the Redragon I find superior to the other mouse:- The feel is just right. The weights inside this mouse gave it a nice heavier quality feel and movement of more expensive mice I own.- All the buttons have a nice if not perfectly satisfying resistance and ""click."" Even the wheel button feels good and solid when I press on it. The other mouse's buttons actually felt clunky and somewhat hollow sounding.- The cord wrapped in red and black braided fiber adds a nice touch which also looks and feels great compared to the other one. I didn't realize there was a difference between braided cords until I felt the 2 side-by-side.- The red light inside slowly pulses illuminating the all the crevises, windows, and logo is just beautiful. The other one was just a dim blue light that was always on.- The center button to change the DPI actually makes a difference when I press it. The first level makes the cursor move slow and the 4th level makes it zip across the screen with barely a flick of the wrist. My favorite and most used it the second level.- It comes in a reusable plastic storage box with a form fitted clear plastic inner packaging shell and a locking lid that snaps closed on all four sides. The box even has the logo imprinted onto the lid. The other one came in a small thin brown cardboard box I've already tossed in the recycle bin (I hope it's recyclable!)- Best of all and most important in my opinion is the incredibly smooth, accurate, and precise tracking ability of the mouse cursor. It seems to just glide across the screen and gives me absolute control of where I want it to go and lands dead-on to what I need to click. It actually has more control than all of my 50 dollar plus Logitech mice. No exaggerating! I think it might be due to the driver and software I downloaded for the Redragon, but it was worth it. This is one point that I'm sure anyone will agree on. If a mouse can't give you precise control and do what it's supposed to besides looking good then it's a waste of money no matter how little you spend on it.Overall, for only literally a few dollars more, this mouse has surprisingly exceeded all of my expectations and is an absolute pleasure to use. I noticed my PC gaming had improved due to not missing any of the buttons anymore or taking extra time and effort to correctly position the cursor where I need it to be. I always thought great gaming mice had to be expensive, but Redragon really changed my views about that. You won't be disappointed with this one.

    AFTER ONE YEAR: This mouse is still great for the price. I've had two within the past year, but I honestly can't blame the manufacturers. This mouse can take some ABUSE! My cats push it off the table onto the wood floor every day, multiple times a day. They've chewed on the cord, they've ripped it out of the USB port... anything you can think of. I eventually ran into disconnecting issues with the first mouse, but like I said it took abuse. My ""new"" 6 month old mouse is still going strong. My boyfriend coincidentally has the same mouse, and he's had it for about a year and a half with no issues.For the price, I really can't complain about this mouse. It has a nice textured feel to it, the USB connector fits well in my USB port, the cord is high quality braided nylon. The color scheme is good, gamers love our edgy red LED lights. It's bright, so you might need to unplug it at night.KEEP IN MIND, for those of you buying your first gaming mouse or looking for a present: 6 buttons means the left click, the right click, the center scroll wheel, 2 side buttons, and the DPI button. Mouses advertised as 6 buttons only have 4 that you can use (5 if you count the scroll wheel).PROS:-Good price-Textured grip, so even sweaty hands won't drop it-High quality braided nylon cord, colored black and red to match the mouse-Edgy color scheme (the red LEDs are nice and bright, you might need to unplug it at night)-Plug and play-no customization of the software required-Customizable weights, which I was unable to try on this mouse but is a good feature nonetheless (more on this in the cons section)-Good size- bigger than a ""regular"" mouse but not too big for my hands, which I have run into before.-Works perfectly on random surfaces-I usually play on my bed or on the couch and I have yet to need a mousepad.CONS:-Long cord- like, way too long. I could sit 6 feet away from my computer and still use this mouse. It's annoying and it gets in the way. Plus I'm sure over time it will start to kink and cause issues.-The cover that holds in the weights just fell off after a day of use before I was able to mess with them, and now I can't find it or the weights. The mouse works well without them though, although it will feel light if you are used to weights.Overall, this seems like a good mouse for the casual gamer. The last mouse I bought of similar price (an AZIO) only lasted a couple months, though, so time will tell if this mouse will be more durable than that one. If I have issues I will be sure to update the review accordingly.

    Alright, I am going to do my best with this review here.For starters I want to start off with what I love about this mouse. Oh my gosh where to start. The mouse I used previous to this Redragon was a Microsoft Mobile 3500 model, which is a small wireless mouse that I used for the past year. The 3500 mobil model is great for travel and bringing to class when I am on my college campus, but not great for everything. So I decided to get another mouse that might be better for my gaming and more at home use. I saw this mouse and thought that for 14 dollars I can try out this highly rated game mouse and loved it. I play games often so this mouse has started improving everything I do in that sense. It has great response time and I love that is has customizable side buttons that I can bind in game. Its also nice to have a button that changes the mouse dpi setting with just one click. Its nice if you prefer your mouse more sensitive in game and less sensitive out of it (like I do. I like having it at 2000 dpi in game and 1600 outside). On top of that I think it looks really cool. Overall I love almost everything about it.Almost everything. There is one issue I run into and I know I am not alone. It has to do with the driver/mouse. When I first was trying this mouse out I was excited to bind the buttons on the side to commands for the game I play most (tf2). When I got in the game and tried to bind the buttons they did not respond and instead they both registered as m3 instead of m4 or m5. I was very confused and so I did some looking around online on how to fix that, because I thought that the software that I got from the official website (www.redragonzone.com) would take care of that. Turns out that every time you restart the computer you need to open the set-up and repair the driver. It doesn't take long (less time than checking my e-mail everyday) and you only have to do that repair after your comp shut's down and starts back up again. To me its not a big issue and I am just fine with it, but if that would bug you than this is not the mouse for you.Overall this mouse is fantastic, and for 14 dollars I don't know if you can get a better deal. I definitely recommend this anyone looking for a game mouse but cannot spend a lot of money on it.As a side note, here are some other specs that are on the box that are not listed in the Amazon page (I want to include this so you can get and even better Idea about the mouse):- Gold Plated USB plug- 10 million click life- 8 mm width scroller- 5 Programmable buttons (as the 6th is the one that changes the dpi and the program has no way to change that.)

    ***Product review update after 2 long years of use***So, I've had this product for about 2 years now and have tried trouble shooting a lot of the problems myself, but now it's gotten to the point where I no longer want to waste more time on trying to salvage this thing. About 1 year of owning this mouse with moderate use, the scroll wheel started acting up and wouldn't catch anymore because the rubber part has it has lost its tension around the wheel and would slip when I'd scroll. At that time, I took apart the mouse and superglued the rubber piece to the underlying plastic wheel (which had no scoring or texture for the rubber to give it traction). I also unhooked the LED light power supply at that time because the breathing red light was just horrendous after about 3-4 months of having the mouse (wished there was an option switch this light on/off without having to take apart the mouse). The second fix came about 18 months after having the mouse but the left click button stopped working consistently. It would register only about 70-80% of the clicks and about  30%% of the time it would register as a double-click. I took about the mouse again and swapped the left and right click buttons, but this only helped with problem for 1-2 months. In all, the mouse lasted me just under 2 years with the tinkering that I had to do.Bottom line:Is it good for the average user?-Yes, for about 1 yearIs it good for the avid user/ gamer?-No for the avid user. No for the gamer, although this is a decent starter mouse to give you the feel of what you'd like for the more permanent replacement.Would I buy this again?-Unlikely---------------------------------------------------Great mouse for the price. It's stylish and has a quality feel to it. The braided cord is a nice touch and actually feels very rugged (I think it has a like a 10 lb tension to it or something). The buttons are rubberized for grip, which is nice and so far none of it has rubbed off or gotten sticky.The DPI button works pretty well and I definitely can tell the difference between the different settings.I bought for everyday net browsing, word processing, and occasional online gaming.The one thing that kind of bothers me about the mouse is contour. It feels like it's made for either right or left handed people and the design kind of makes the grip not as comfortable as it could have been. So along the sides of the mouse, there are grooves for your thumb and your 4th/5th finger. The thumb grooves feel pretty natural, which is very nice, and the side buttons are great too because they are textured differently to allow you to differentiate between the two. However, the grooves for the 4th/5th digit do not feel quite right. There is a little over hang from the buttons, that kind of forms the grooves, and it feels a little restricting. I know it seems like minutia, but I've formed a little callus on the medial side of my 4th finger because of this.

    as a budget option this is a fantastic mouse, it feels good to hold, is customizable and comfortable to hold. they perform serviceably and i have not had any real issues functionality wise.the saying goes ""you get what you pay for"" and this holds true to an extend for these, i have gone through two and will be ordering a third one as the pads underneath, and mouse buttons tend to start going after a couple of years or so of use while my other mice have lasted reasonably longer.while i do personally not care for this fact, it is one that i am ok with.if youre on a budget or dont mind replacing it every few years, i would say seriously consider this as a budget or shorter time mouse to use.for 20-30$ this performs well and is a solid option for people on a budget

    I have been an owner of this mouse since November and honestly, I like using it due to the fact that it works out of the box, has software that's easy to install and easy to use, and because it also has a rapid fire/click button which I have customized it to where 1 click would equal 5 clicks. My only critiques of this mouse is that some spots of the RGB lighting are dimmer than other spots and that the dpi buttons and lighting button on top of the mouse are kind of loose.

    I got this as a gift for a 10 y/o who is really into gaming. He was initially thrilled by the sheer design and look of the mouse but after using it for an hour of play he made the announcement that he was filled with happiness over the shortcut buttons and programmable ability along with the colored lights. This old head doesn't know exactly what that means but you might!

    Perfect gaming mouse for the price.  Lots of customizable buttons, and is color responsive.  Thought it was cheap when I first got it, but have consistently used it for last 3 months and haven't had a single issue with it.

    This is a great mouse for cheap and has some nice features. I would give 5 stars if not for two things: It feels too light and the left mouse button often squeaks when clicked. I was able to fix the latter issue myself and I have directions below on how to do so.The mouse seem fairly well built and has been quite responsive on my computer. Personally, I think the appearance could be less garish (no need for an LED backlit logo or red plastic accents). However this is subjective so it doesn't factor into my review. The DPI button is the black chevron just behind the scroll wheel. When clicked, it switches between the various DPI settings which noticeably changes the tracking feel of the mouse on the screen. The scroll wheel has nice bumps between each notch. I feel like these could be a bit more snappy, but it's a very nice-feeling wheel nonetheless. The mouse buttons are responsive but quite audible, so don't buy it if you want a quiet mouse. The forward and back buttons on the left side are placed well for easy access by the right thumb, and the forward button is covered in raised bumps for texture and grip. The mouse feels good in the hand (my hands are medium-sized) and is comfortable for a palm grip. The USB cable seems like it will last a long time. When connected to Windows (7, 64-bit) for the first time, the drivers are found quickly without issue.My two issues with the mouse are rather minor. The first is that it is surprisingly light, and I would like a slightly more weighty feel to provide more resistance across the mousepad. The mouse does come with a set of weights inside, but these should have been made much heavier (or the materials of the mouse itself made heavier) because weights can always be removed but more cannot be added. Redragon should have erred on the side of a heavier mouse that users could make lighter if they wanted instead of a light mouse that can only be made lighter. At any rate, I haven't found the weight to measurably impact my experience with the mouse, it's relatively minor preference.However, the left mouse button began to squeak fairly regularly almost as soon as I started to use the mouse. This should not be the case and should have been caught in quality control before the mouse went to marked. The squeak is rather subtle but just noticeable enough to be aggravating. While the squeak doesn't always occur (and seems to be based on where your finger is on the button when you click) under my normal use I found that it squeaked the majority of the time when I had my finger placed where it was most comfortable for me. However, I was able to fix the click and now I have no remaining significant issues with the mouse, but I took a star off the review because this issue should not need to be fixed by the user.-------INSTRUCTIONS FOR FIXING THE SQUEAK [Materials needed: Small phillips screwdriver, exacto knife]1. Unplug the mouse and remove the two teflon pads near the rear of the mouse. I used the exacto knife to pry these up and off.2. Remove the 2 screws that hold the top and bottom sections together.3. Pinch the sides of the top section together near the front (but below the buttons). Gently pull the sections apart.4. Turn over the top half and remove the 3 screws holding the circuit board onto the top half. Gently pull the circuit board back and away from the two tabs holding it in place.5. Now with the top half disconnected from the bottom, identify the left mouse button (reversed when upside down). Click the button and notice where the moving plastic part slides past the stationary plastic. Along the inner edge side  of the stationary plastic should be a very slight protrusion that rubs against the moving part. Carefully slice between these two with the exacto knife, putting pressure toward the stationary segment so that you shave away a very slight amount of plastic and the protrusion is removed.6. Test out the button with a number of clicks in different areas to make sure the squeak is gone. If you're certain it is, slide the circuit board back into place, reattach it with the screws, and carefully pinch the sides of the top half together again. Note that there are tabs near the front of the top section that need to slide underneath the matching tabs on the bottom section. This might take a couple of tries, but gently try to match up the tabs and slide the top back into place. Don't use a lot of force! Then replace the bottom screws and the teflon pads and plug the mouse back in.After I reassembled the mouse it still works perfectly fine and the squeak is gone. Hopefully this helps you too.

    I love this mouse! The software was super easy to find on their website to control the color scheme and mouse settings. Middle wheel has become a little squeaky after only a month or so of use, but it still works, and the mouse itself is incredibly responsive.

    update: August2018: still works, middle click stopped working a while back.  Inexpensive, sorta, so maybe I shouldn't expect more, IDK.update 13Jan2017: it still works, a relief after that crummy Logitech trackball. I originally gave this 2 stars, but I've changed my mind. It works fairly well. They advertise this for gaming, something i know nothing about. I assumed it would have more programmable buttons, maybe like some fancy trackballs. Maybe I didn't know what I was buying, I expected a bunch of whizz-bang features. This mouse has served me well, for a while now. While I'm disappointed it didn't have more features, it does the job well. So, for surfing and such, I'm raising my rating from 2 to 3 stars. Maybe I'll revisit this review. If it's still working in a year....I don't know if this is good for gaming, but for most of my stuff, it's been decent. Maybe there are cheaper mouses that are as good. But as far as this mouse, so far, so good. I can tell you it has a thing in it with weights.update 25Oct2015: Here it is a week later, still working. I bought the #1 best seller trackball the Logitech m570 previously, the scrollwheel went out within months. So much for Logitech products. This mouse the RedDragon, is still working after a week or so. Not a great emdorsement, but at least its working. I write negative reviews to both help others stay away, and to hurt the company making rotten products. If this mouse goes south, I'll do an immediate update. I've explained my frustrations below.The feel of the mouse is pretty good, its symmetrical, nice for you lefties. I have no need for wireless, this thing is corded, which is one less thing to go wrong.Where I live now, I have a tiny desk, surrounded on both sides by furniture, so there's limited space. I wanted a trackball, because of space limitations. I've read that trackballs are less popular, fewer are available, possibly meaning the competition isn't there, nor is the quality.I prefer trackballs, but setting the sensitivity(mouse/cursor speed) has made this fairly comfortable. If you're not a gamer, & I'm not, I suppose you could do worse. Because I have this mouse, I can risk tearing  apart my Ancient MacAlly trackball, with the hope of getting the scroll wheel to work again. I am not a Mac user, but the trackball's 4 buttons were sufficient, and one can work around the nonfunctional trackball. Ít came only with Mac software, so wasn't customizable, but the default setup is the most logical setup anyway.But who wants to?------------------------------------I'm not a gamer, so Io can't say anything to help you folks. I expected a bit more from this mouse, I guess I love buttons, this hasn't been a great choice, it doesn't seem to be awful, either. Somehow I thought I'd be able to use the 6° button for *enter* or something, i once had a fancy trackball with extra buttons/functions.Really, for the regular non-gamer like me, this mouse has the minumum buttons acceptable, l;-click, R-click, forward & back.When one's looking to. buy this, on thee page, further down, you'll see several more mouses Many seem to share the same body shape, and nearly the same lights on the mouse-body. I can't evaluate  those mouses, just mentioning the similarity in appearance.So far, this mouse hasn't been too bad, the frustration of driver-software is something that angered me, So far, this mouse hasn't been too bad, question is---will it at least hold up for a year or more? I'll update if/when  it fails.I guess for a non-gamer, this isn't anything special, but doesn't seem to be the worst possible choice, either. The mouse is always lit, kind of serving as a nightlight. You should probably cover it, as they say even a little light can hurt your sleep, I don't cover it, tho.ORIGINAL REVIEW  18OCT2015:Went to register product--site given on box was wrong. I went to their home page, found I could register from there. Strike one.No software provided w/mouse. Not good. Went to website, clicked to download for * Centrophorus *  mouse. Box says this is a 6 button mouse, yet the box has the strange name I just gave. But on their website, the download is listed as for Centrophorus, a 5-button mouse.--------------------------------I downloaded that, what else could I do? Must restart PC, OK. PC locked up on restart, had to go for a 2nd restart. Finally, I find 5-button software in the start menu. The picture on the set-up software is clearly not a picture of this mouse. On the set-up software, click on *hardware*, of all things, it says the manufacturer is Microsoft!  Since this software is the new stuff on my PC, it must be the driver for this mouse.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just behind the scrollwheel is a chevron, or arrow shaped key. I can depress it, nothing happens. The set-up software that I installed from the Challenger site show no such arrow.--------------------------------------------------------------------I am not a gamer, I bought this based on the good reviews, & supposedly fair price. The  aggravation I encountered in the first hour  of ownership makes me sorry I bought this. I don't care how well it works from here on out--it deserves no more than 2 stars. I doubt that it is a good long-term mouse, & it provides nothing more than a fairly simple mouse. You might want to look elsewhere. Even if I've made a mistake on one of these issues, which I doubt, this was just unpleasant. Its nothing special, & the stupid lights & cute dragon picture should be annoying in short order.--------------------------------------------------------------As a final insult, I went back to the Challenger website. I downloaded the *manual*  for the M601, which is this mouse. The *manual* is the same thing as the useless paper they give you with this mouse. On one side of this paper(long, when unfolded) is Chinese & English writing, telling you nothing of value. The other side of this large sheet is in several European languages. I don't think that side explains anything, either.--------------------------------------So, I've bought myself trouble, at best a near minimal mouse. Bet you could find a much cheaper mouse than this with the same features. And joy of joys, if you keep your PC in your bedroom, maybe you'll need to cover it so as to not mess up your sleep, with the light & all.This thing is pretty, but its really kinda crummy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Notice that under every bad review is a comment by the company to fix things. Do you really think they care? I Don't!!

    Alright, so to be clear - this mouse has a sensor that will not compete with a name brand companies optical gaming grade sensor in terms of tracking and consistency (ie. Logitech, SteelSeries, Zowie, etc.). Now let's continue to the review.At the price point of $12.99 this mouse definitely exceeded my expectations. Seriously for the price I was not expecting much, mainly the reviews and non-outrageous looking pictures of the product drew me in. I work from home time to time along with playing games quite a bit, I love FPS games particularly. I got this as a ""back-up"" mouse as i'm used to using a rival 300 (and like quality mice) for FPS games and such (competitive). My requirements for a back-up mouse were simple - needs forward and back buttons, doesn't look to crazy, does what it's supposed to do. My rival had recently broke after several years of reliable performance. The build quality on this mouse appears to be on-point. Nothing felt loose or cheap about the process while inspecting it/holding it in my hand right from the unbox. The mouse clicks were firm and comparable to most gaming mice i've used in the past, they have an omron click feel (to me).Now for my take aways:The sensor seems to be a little sluggish at times, nothing super critical but coming from a high quality sensor it was definitely something noticeable, but at $12.99 it was something to be expected. Their is a reason most newer/more known gaming mice go for more of a premium price, being around $60-80. I will note that most premium gaming mice do include custom UI software that allow for more in-depth custom tuning. If you're looking for that you will not find it here but come on.... $12.99...Definitely made for a crowd with smaller hands. The rival 300 was a little bit big for me but still comfortable, this mouse definitely is a lot smaller but still fits alright for me. An extended gaming session could yield some discomfort, but again depends on your grip style and size of your hand.The side grips on this mouse are plastic, probably helps with durability/life of the mouse shell and cosmetic appearance but doesn't sit well with me in lines of comfort. Not a huge deal for the purpose that I bought it for but something definitely worth noting.The red led light is constantly in a ""breathing"" mode but it doesn't really bother me as i'm used to rgb lighting.Most places i've seen this mouse advertised promote custom UI software but this (currently) does not appear to be the case. Mouse settings in windows control panel seems to be your options for remapping which for me is not a big deal but was definitely a misleading thing. If you're trying to bind custom loops then you might be disappointed.The shape of the mouse takes some getting used to, a combination of the smaller size and plastic wrapped completely around (rigidness). I'm used to mice shaped more towards ambi with a slight right-handed dominant contour.Overall, even with my takeaways they were not critical enough of issues to really bring the rating of this product down for me. The build quality is nice. Braided cable. Lengthy cable. Crisp lighting (for those who are into that sort of thing). On the fly dpi switching.If you're considering this product I would recommend it. Good for any one on a budget, looking for a decent back-up until a major name replacement, or someone who just doesn't care about brand names. I've read reviews of others who had faulty mice, no issues on my end so far. If I run into anything I will update this review but i'm currently awaiting my main replacement which is going to be a zowie fk2. As I said from the start I will leave you with, if you're coming from a major name gaming mouse this will not be 100% comparable in terms of accuracy of the sensor. Don't expect a Zowie, Logitech, SteelSeries, etc. comparable sensor. I would recommend this product. Great back-up, or entry level gaming mouse.

    The mouse itself works fine and has lovely RGB colors, but it's a headache to figure out where to find the software to program it since Redragon has like 3 different websites to search for it on and they don't provide any sort of link to it with the mouse documentation.Once I finally found the correct software for the M910 Ranger, it just says ""No Device"" and won't detect the mouse. I tried all sorts of things to fix it and googled around for a several hours and couldn't figure out how to get it to let me program it. Just finally threw my hands up and gave up. I saw many others have the same problem with this mouse when I was googling it.So in the end, I had to download X-Mouse Button Control free software separate from Redragon just to be able to program the buttons. It doesn't seem to find the ""Fire"" button so I can't change that to something else... but at least it let me change the 2 side buttons to control the media volume which is what I always use those for.So, useless headache software that didn't let me program it so I had to find my own work-around, but the mouse itself is working just fine otherwise.

The mouse operates as intended and feels and looks good. My only gripe with it was finding the software for it. On the manufacturer's download page, I downloaded the software for the M910RGB (which I assume is the black counterpart to the white version I chose, which has the model number M910-W). It wasn't able to find the mouse as a device, and it looked like it was made in the early 2000's. Notably, this software was not the one advertised in the images provided for the mouse. I then downloaded a similar yet different software for the M910KS/M910-WS mouse, (it looked like it could be wired or wireless) and it worked correctly. I'm able to change DPI settings intricately, the color settings, et cetera. This software was also the one that seems to be depicted in the images for this mouse model. Overall, a very confusing setup, and it seems like, looking online, I'm not the only one who had trouble with it.

    Replaced my pathetically inadequate Logitech G502 SE Hero which succumbed to unresponsive and double clicking buttons at about 15 months of moderate use. I still have legacy mice from the 90s that work, so...It did it at a fraction of the price, too. $15.99 on Black Friday special, and not much more at other times.This mouse has a more generalized ergonomic as well, so my weaker right two fingers don't false click and otherwise fall of the right side of the rodent.  It's a bit lighter than some gaming mice, which I like.  Cord is slightly less flexible and long than some others as well, but it's plenty adequate for my purposes.For those without undisciplined kids in the house, it comes with a sheet of Redragon stickers. Get this as either a primary or a spare mouse today!

    OK, I am NOT a gamer...I am a fat old woman with big fingers and hands who cannot stand using the touch pad on my laptop.  This mouse is comfortable, responsive, and I really like the lights for aesthetic reasons and because it helps me find the mouse when it drops off the desk.  It was truly plug and play and I have used it for online streaming, some simple computer games, and online jigsaw puzzles which actually requires a good mouse to select and move the pieces quickly and easily.  So, if a person who does Yahtzee and jigsaw puzzles doesn't count as a ""Gamer"" then I doubt my race review will matter to many.  But, I do love this mouse.

    I order this mouse in early 2016. I used it to accompany a really low-grade laptop that I used for just about everything that required internet access when I wasn't in high school. I had used it all throughout high school and am using it through college and for casual gaming on the side as well.Now the durability of this thing is impressive in my case compared to many other reviews I see here. It has fallen off tables onto solid stone floors and average school floors (hard tiles and such) multiple times without so much as a slight dent to the outer shell part. The only parts to sustain long-term damage have been the USB portion of the cable where it has slightly warped over the years due to how I would wrap it, and the connecting portion of the cable to the mouse body which has started to show bare wires with their internal coverings intact.As for the consistency in the useability of the mouse.The multiple sensitivity settings have been of great use in day-to-day life with a very easy switch at any time. The mouse wheel has not degraded or slipped in any way for me. The movement is only VERY SLIGHTLY jittery when trying to do precise movements. The buttons on the side I have yet to actually do much of anything with, leaving them as quick access back and forth buttons for browsing has actually been my preferred setting with them.Even now after I've upgraded my set up to a full-blown tower with a new keyboard, headset, and monitor this mouse still holds up to everything I require from it.The only real downside I can point out is maybe how easily it gets dirty over time with the design of it including so many open holes near where my thumb rests, allowing for nasty dirt and sweat build-up over time. Also, the mouse is slightly too small to fit the right side of my hand. My hands are just about average size and my ring finger and pinky have to hang off awkwardly to the side most of the time which can cause them to cramp up if I'm not careful and make sure to move them once in a while.Other than that I definitely recommend buying this mouse for the sheer durability offered by it at such a price range. 3.5/5

    This mouse is truly amazing I have over 4 mouse's from redragon and all of them are amazing but this one is definitely different, the texture of the mouse is outstanding it has like a rubbery none slip feel to it compared to the m711 FPS version. The mouse also have a rapid fire button which I haven't used yet but I'm fond to it ( I've used it before ) Rapid Fire on a gaming mouse basically does like a million clicks in a second very useful for MMORPG games.There's are 3 buttons top button is for (HIGH DPI) second button (Lower DPI) third button ( Customizing the RGB themes ) There are two other buttons of the side of the mouse I'm assuming maybe forward and backwards for internet pages (example) - if you go to YouTube or whatever website and you click on image you can press the first side button and it'll basically bring you back to the previous page. So instead of clicking on the internet back or forward button on the webpage you can do it on your mouse.In front of the mouse it showcases the RGB looks truly amazing definitely helps at night on my mousepad to see in front of me lol. You can download the program for the mouse on the website ( which i have ) and it'll basically give you all types of customization options from ( DPI - RGB Colors - RBG Color Effects )Scroll wheel on the mouse is extremely smooth and highly responsiveOverall this mouse is a A+ for gamers, office users, regular people that wants a mouse.The price is definitely Fair, Affordable, Durable, I would recommend #RedragonGaming #Redragon Mouse to anyone and everyone that's looking for a amazing top of the line affordable mouse!( Wired Gaming Mouse )

    This mouse is a great value for the price.  Switched from a trackball mouse and this is my first optical mouse in a long time.  Very accurate and feels great in my hand.

    -Function-Product worked right out of the box.  All buttons even the DPI setting button on top.  It seems the only reason for software is to control light and a GUI for the settings.  Personally, I'm not going to install the software as I don't know this company and frankly, don't trust software out of China.This is a Made in China mouse - I wanted something corded and inexpensive and this fit that bill.  Plus, the pulsing glow is satisfyingly cool.  It rotates all colors all on it's own.The DPI setting works as expected - I had to change the default promptly but the mouse does remember its setting so you should be able to set it and forget it.-Feel-This mouse stuck out because of the weights included, however I find it is hardly noticeable with the weights in or out.  I like a heaver mouse, which I thought this was, but it feels lighter.  Just my opinion.Last, the mouse is rather flat and not very curved on top.  Again, I like more curve and this falls short of my desires.There is nothing wrong with the mouse.  If I shopped this in the store, I might not have bought it though.- Impression -I was very impressed with packaging.  It comes in a translucent plastic box with locks on 4 sides.  Inside, the mouse is snug in a plastic tray along with a brand logo (who doesn't love stickers!) and instructions.  The instruction manual has about 6 pages dedicated to each language known to man - it's a book!- Recommendation -I would recommend this mouse to someone who isn't like me.  I like a heavier mouse and one with more curve on the top.  I'm probably a little picky, but I use my computer for work and play so I want comfortable-to-me tools.  There isn't anything I can say negative objectively about the mouse.I believe it is worth the price and would satisfy most people's needs.

    (Note review for M601 gaming mouse--be sure to select style/color to get reviews of the one you actually care about. Why do they combine the score for these? This seems very wrong.)I've been using it daily for well over a year and it's great. Not just great for the price, it's great.For the most part, it's great, and at the price it's excellent. It tracks well, detects lifts accurately, buttons are nice, and the glides are a great match for various hard mouse pads. The buttons are a rough nonslip texture. The sides are vented to keep the fingers cool. The shape of the buttons makes it easy to keep track of where your hand is on the mouse. The knurled mouse wheel is great--not too hard to turn, but a definite feel that you have reached the next tick. It does not go sideways and I *really like* that. You can tell the two thumb buttons apart by feel.If I could change one thing about the shape, it is that sometimes my thumb slips when I lift the mouse to reposition it, and I am worried I will press the button under the thumb by accident. I haven't yet, but it's the one thing I would change.The weights pretty much exactly offset the drag of the cord. They would not be necessary if the mouse were cordless, but ironically if the mouse were cordless it would have a big battery in it, so it's a moot point really.But when I first put it down onto the SX, the feet weren't flat. On the perfectly flat aluminum pad, it rocked back and forth on two feet. Just a little, though, and I was thinking: maybe the plastic is just thin enough that it can be bent out of shape? Grabbing the body/frame of the mouse and twsting it firmly, I was able to straighten the frame, and now it sits flat. But if you don't feel like firmly-but-gently torquing your mouse into the right shape you might want to go upscale and pick a different mouse.I didn't even notice the warping on a soft pad, so if you use a soft mouse pad this is irrelevant.[UPDATE] It did once gradually twist back into ""not sitting flat"" mode. I twisted it again and it has stayed flat ever since. Maybe just a fluke.[UPDATE several hours later] I'm noticing that this mouse has awesome glides. Easily as good/better than SS teflon replacement pads. I'm sure the SS mouse pad will ruin them within a day or two, of course. Still sitting flat so I'm going back up to 5 stars again.[UPDATED several times] It's a few weeks later and it's still flat, so there you go.

    My old mouse broke so I needed to buy a new one. I looked online for something on the cheaper side that would hold up for a while. Found this mouse online and I was pretty happy with the product.It arrived pretty quickly inside its own case. The case is durable, so the mouse wasn't nicked or in bad condition upon opening the box. Inside there were instructions for warranty and a booklet about the mouse.Now for some key features of the mouse. You can switch between 1000/1600/2000 DPI. There is one button to change between DPI, the scroll wheel, left and right click, a button to go backwards/forwards in tab history. You cannot customise any of the buttons which I saw as a downside. As this is a gaming mouse I would have like the ability to at least have customised the side buttons. It's also a shame that the light under the DPI button doesn't stay on. It changes brightness depending on your DPI setting, but it would have been nice if it were actually on when you have it at 1000 DPI. What I really liked was the weight tuning kit. I played around with different weights until I found the one right for me. For a cheap mouse I wasn't expecting this, so it was a nice feature. It's also not hard to change the weights or open the bottom of the mouse. The braided cord also doesn't get tangled as easily as the cord to my old mouse which saves me the frustration of untangling. It's also pretty durable so I don't have to worry about any accidental tugging causing rips or tears. Another thing that bothered me was that you cannot invert the left and right click, so if you like using the mouse with your left hand, things may be a bit harder for you.This isn't a high quality gaming mouse, so I personally wouldn't play any CS or many fps with this mouse as I prefer having customisable buttons on the side to limit keyboard use, but it works well for most other games especially if those games have adjustments for mouse sensitivity. It is very easy to click this mouse, so if you play any games requiring constant clicking this would work well for that purpose. That being said, if you don't want to accidentally click anything you may want to be careful with how much pressure you put on the buttons.Overall, this mouse serves its purpose and I can see it lasting for a long time. It's pretty good quality for the price even though there are some shortcomings. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a simpler gaming mouse on a budget.

    Has lots of buttons for the gamers that need keybinds to their mouses. The RGB is nice, and the mouse fits well in the hands!
