    I've get so much more exercise, studying, and phone conversations done with these headphones!These are great bone conduction headphones! They have excellent battery life and there's an audible voice (English) that will tell you how much battery power is left in the headphones when they're turned on. I've only run out maybe once. That being said, these headphones don't actually cover your ear, so they work best in environments with low to medium noise. Sometimes that can be plus when you need to pay attention to your surroundings (for example at night). As long you understand where they work well, they're awesome!Use Case 1: Exercise - These are excellent because they're clean, nothing to stick in your ear and can be cleaned with a little bit of hand soap and water. While exercising, these are great for podcasts and motivational music. I use these in the gym and outside. Only issues are when I'm next to a road and there's a loud truck or group of motorcycles riding by.Use Case 2: Studying - These work best in quiet coffee shops or libraries with light conversation in the background. I usually put on some non-vocal electronic. These won't block out the sound of a TV, so I've found I needed different headphones to avoid those distractions.Use Case 3: Phone Calls - Great for phone calls in light to medium noise environments. They work well in a home or quiet office. I usually have these on and go for a walk outside.Tips: I bought the Hermitshell case for this and some of the longer after market charging cables.Background: I bought the standard after using the sizing guide on the manufacturer's website. I've never installed the app for the firmware update, so I'm using it with the original as-shipped software.10-Month Update: Still worth every penny and Shokz Customer Service is awesome! Keep your serial Number handy for any replacements!After almost a year of *heavy* daily use, the battery power is still great (Slightly, but still around 80% of original functionality which is great!)Also, the power button starting getting sticky and it became difficult to turn on and off. Thankfully Shokz has a two-year warranty. I had to go to Shokz website to submit my proof of purchase (easy to get from Amazon) and the product serial number. I didn't the original documents, so I had to use the macro function on my iPhone to zoom into the charging port to grab the serial number (after having to clean it with alcohol and qtips). So keep your serial number handy if you need to make a claim! The new ones arrived right away and work great!

    i bought and owned a pair of SHOKZ OpenComm  they were  amazingly  comfortable and awsome with great noise canceling mic i couldnt have been more happy with them till  i wasn't  the mic quite! They were still under warranty,  company notified me 3 times that i would receive a replacement but 6months to a year and i still did not get a replacement!!  Picked up a cheap used bone induction for a while then needed another pair still no replacement from shokz! I was hesitant to order any thing from shokz again. Did research and chose another brand.  Mojowa,  great qulity, amazing bluetooth range, decent sound, ok mic but terible fit for me  they hurt!  no mater what i did i could not get them comfrtable, regretted ordering them!kept thinking of the comfort of my old shokz what else did they offer?  Still decided to stay away from the open com but relented and  order these SHOKZ OpenRun Pro! Amost didnt!! but glad i did!! i can wear them all l day  i even forget i have them on!!!!  full disclosure;  i use my shokz most for cell phone use driving and construction work,  music listening is secondary, for you earbud sound critics they probably will not match sony or bose  but the sound is vastly  improved from my first  open com and the best in all  the bone inductions i have had!(FYI  little note/trick with bone induction, if they are not loud eough for you, if  you are in a loud enviroment  use earplugs or sound proof ear muffs and they will be loud!! Sounds i know,  crazy but true!I do not like earbud or things in my ears  i also like being aware of my surroundings so bone induction is the only way to go for me!  With a great battery life and fast chargeing, unrivaled all day comfort, sound greatly improve and a good mic thease SHOKZ OpenRun Pro! for me, are by far the best overall most comfortable bone induction headset available!  i want to stay a shokz user forever  i hope the quality of these excedes my last pair  of shokz or at least the costomer service is more reliable!!  because for now, these SHOKZ OpenRun Pro are great!  Stay tuned!!

    I purchased a pair Aftershocks in 2019, after wasting money on all different types of Bluetooth headphones. I can't wear anything in my ear canal. I suffer from chronic infections and my right ear canal just won't hold an ear bud.  My 2019 pair is getting to the point of not holding a charge anymore. A charge will only last 3-4 hours now.So, I decided to upgrade to a new pair. The sound quality has definitely improved. The comfort is about the same, light weight and easy to wear all day. I often will sleep with them on while traveling to block out background noises in hotels. I also like that these came with a case, my last pair didn't. I really like the magnetic charging cable must easier to use than the micro-usb on my old pair. The charging cable is short so I did order a longer one. Although these seem a little pricey, they are well worth the cost. My last pair has latest over 4 years with no issues. Prior to them I was lucky to have a pair last 6 months. I really can't express how much I love these! No pain, no discomfort, decent sound quality and durability!

    I recently purchased the Shokz Pro headphones, and overall, I'm quite satisfied with their performance during my workouts. These headphones are incredibly light, making them comfortable to wear for extended periods without causing any discomfort or strain on my head.One of the standout features of the Shokz Pro headphones is their secure fit. They stay firmly in place, even during intense workouts involving a lot of movement and sweating. This is a significant advantage for those who engage in rigorous exercise routines.However, there are a couple of drawbacks that I noticed while using these headphones. Firstly, the ear cushions are a bit too soft for my liking. While they provide a comfortable fit, I found that they don't offer the same level of noise isolation that I expected. This can be problematic, especially when working out in noisy surroundings or crowded gyms.Additionally, I found the volume output of the Shokz Pro headphones to be a bit underwhelming. If you enjoy listening to your music at high volumes during workouts, these headphones might not meet your expectations. While the sound quality itself is decent, it lacks the necessary punch to overcome external noise distractions.For individuals who prioritize a loud and immersive audio experience during workouts, I would suggest considering alternative options that provide a similar lightweight design but with a more powerful sound output.On a positive note, I found the Shokz Pro headphones to be durable and well-built. I've been using them daily for an extended period, and they have held up nicely without any signs of wear and tear.In conclusion, the Shokz Pro headphones offer a lightweight and secure fit that is ideal for workouts. However, they do fall short in terms of volume output and noise isolation. If you prefer to really hear your music during workouts, especially in noisy surroundings, I would recommend exploring other options that provide a similar design but with a louder audio capability. Nonetheless, for those seeking a comfortable and reliable option, the Shokz Pro headphones are worth considering.

    I've tried many many bone conducting earphones since I use my headphones all day and in ear or over ear headphones causes a lot of heat/hearing issues in long term. So far I've never seen one that I can easily listen to and not broadcast what I'm listening to outside. All others were somewhat audible from outside. Low volume level, enough to disturb your partner night time or passenger next to you while travelling. This one is as perfect as you can ever get. This really sits on the bone, does not give out audio to outside (you can barely hear it if you remove it from your ear and hold it half an inch from your ear. And even during night time, it is inaudible to my partner. Sound quality is also somehow much better than others I've tried. I'm not gonna lie, I've tried all other options because I did not want to pay this absurd price for this one. But in the long run, with me changing headphones because I was not happy with them and some others just failing/breaking down, I've spent more than the price of this one. I still think it is way too expensive for what it is, but it is without competition I guess that's why the price can be so high and they still can sell this. I've bought it in the end after all, right?  So far, I could not be happier. Highly recommend it. So, as for negatives, first you really need to know that any bone conducting headphones will feel funny/tingly when you're listening to high volume music or high bass situations. So if you're listening to low frequency stuff like explosion scenes in a movie or music with high bass then you will feel a bit tingly if your volume is high. Second thing is battery life. 10 hours nowadays is too short of a runtime for headphones. My over the ear headphones can run literally days without being turned off at all, while it is still playing music. I used to not even bother to turn the music or my headphones off, I'd just leave them on my desk and come Monday, they will still be playing the music. Of course this is a tiny device with a tiny battery so 10 hours it is I guess. Just be prepared to charge it daily. Which leads us to: Third, proprietary  charging cable. That really is something that always bugs me. Why oh why would companies not use standard cables? I mean I know why, it is a business model to get more money out of you and it is easier to design a product like this if you don't have to worry about the depth of a USB C connector. But still, it is annoying. you have to carry around a special cable when you're travelling just for this one. The rest of my devices, laptops, external mobile screens, writing pad, my phone, my mouse they all are charged with usb c, so I can share the adapter and cable. But now I'll have to carry this cable too. And if I forget... well no music after 10 hours. These are all the negatives so positives outweigh by a large margin. In the end, I highly recommend these if you have any hearing issues caused by heat/moisture of keeping on headphones all day, if you have hearing loss due to eardrum or if you want to ride a bicycle while still being able to hear approaching traffic or if you just plain and simple have money to burn. The length of this review should show how much I liked these. Seriously though, try to switch to bone conducting headphones even if it is a cheaper one if you have the issues that I've mentioned. It makes your life much better and keeps your hearing and ears in better condition.

    These headphones are great, I can still hear my surroundings and it has some pretty cool base. I sometimes forget they are on my head that is how great they fit since they do not go in my ear they do not make my ear soar for wearing them for so long. They last me all day long and they charge so fast. I love these headphones. I do not see how these headphones can be noise canceling since they do not go in your ears.

    Finally a product that delivers on promises. This thing is very well designed and very easy to use. The microphones are great and sound quality is very good for normal conversations. Not for high fidelity listening hit fine of you are a runner or cyclist and sweat a lot. They stay secure to your head. Pleased in every way

    No matter how small they come, earbuds make my ears ache after wearing only a short time. I thought discomfort was the price I had to pay for personal listening. This headset by SHOKZ has truly changed my life.The first set I got was in an airport where there was only one size. I purchased them and immediately felt relief. They are not noise canceling which is no big deal for me. The only drawback was how far they stuck out behind my head. Still, they were far more comfortable than anything I had previously worn. I used them for months until…My sister-in-law showed me hers which were smaller and lucky for me they were on a back Friday sale!!These are so comfortable I no longer need to keep buying cheap sleep headphones that slide around on my small pinhead. I rarely wake up due to discomfort. They charge fast and are ready to go. Phone conversations are clear on both ends. Music and books sound great and yet I can still respond to what is happening around me. I won’t pretend these are the best choice for air travel but they work well enough for me.I have recommended both sizes to all my family and friends. Each that purchased have thanked me.

    First off, if you are looking for a high fidelity experience, these are not for you.  These do not sound as good as most in-ear earphones that I have used.  However, the experience is really not that bad.  I am not offended by the sound quality since I understand the limitations.  I have not had these too long, but I seem to think they are sounding better than the first time I used them or I might just be getting used to them and forgetting my old in-ear pair.  I am not sure, I just think they are totally fine for the purpose.For running these are very good.  They are lightweight and comfortable and the controls are easy to use.  Speaking of controls, I appreciate the actual buttons and not the sensor buttons I had in my previous set these replaced.  I hated having to perfectly tap to get something to happen while I was running.  I particularly hated getting a little sweat on the touch sensor and having my volume start ramping up until the point where I needed to yank them.  Tactile buttons are totally welcome.When being near a road, it can be challenging to hear them and I have needed to up the volume higher than I normally would like.  That is something to consider.  From my research, bone conduction headphones can impact hearing over time if too loud.  It just impacts a different part.  However, that is part of why I like these.  Situational awareness.  The other day I was running on some trails and a person on a bike said something and I was able to move over.  I would not have heard what he said with my old in-ear set.Overall, I am giving these 2 thumbs up for the time being.  I will update this review in the event my opinion changes.  I would have loved to wait until the OpenSwim Pro is released, but unfortunately I needed a new set of earphones sooner.

    Update 03/02/2024 - Although it was disappointing the battery in my unit gave out I'll have to say the warranty process was executed with precision by Shokz.  Shokz responded within the stated time and took care of all my concerns.  In a word their performance was flawless.  Back to 5 stars.  Original review follows.Yes these have a 2 year warranty.  With this in mind.....I bought these to use while cycling so I can be aware of my surroundings.  For that purpose these are great because they do NOT block your ear canal at all.  On top of that they're comfortable.  A tradeoff is the sound quality isn't going to be up to par with a high end earbud that blocks off your ear canal.  I have 2 sets of earbuds because when I don't need to be aware of my surroundings I prefer a traditional high end set that focuses on noise reduction and sound quality.Like I said in the title I bought these less than a year ago and the battery is pretty much toast.  This set use to operate for hours and now will barely make it through a 75 minute workout.  What a pain in the rear end to almost be through my ride and hear the dreaded low battery message.  Used to be I'd get about 3 of those messages before it shut down.  Now I get 1 and it immediately shuts down.Shokz used to require registration to file a warranty claim but now says you don't need to.  All you have to do is fill out a warranty claim form.  To do this you'll need the serial of your device (on these it is wrapped around the charge port and you'll need a magnifying glass - if you still have the box that's a much easier place to get it), and a dated sales receipt.  Once submitted you need to wait for Shokz's response (they claim within 2 business days) - they may or may not require you to send in your set.  My understanding is there will be no fee even if I have to return these - but if there is these will go in the trash and I'll move on to Bose Ultra's.The main reason for my 3 star review here is I expect to be able to use something like this for years before failure - and here I am at 7 months dealing with a warranty claim.  What a PITA.

    I do love these. But there are some pros and cons:Pros:*Not in my ear. That's a major pro. A big one.*Sound quality is good. I'm not a huge music buff. I just like to listen to classical while I work.*Comfortable. They barely bother me after a few hours.*Discrete. They aren't very visible*They work even w my long hair. I put them under my hair in the back.*Battery life is decent. Lasts me a couple days at work. I don't use them all day long.*You don't have to take them off to hear people or talk to people, though I usually still pause whatever is playing as it can still be distracting*They work decent for phone calls. My dad said they sounded really really clear. I was pleased as I didn't expect a mic. They worked better for phone calls than for watching movies. The audio wasn't bad for a call.*They connect really easily to my iphone 12. My son had trouble getting his to connect and stay recognized with his laptop and his iphone 6s, but I have had no problems.*Charger connects easily because it's magnetic. They charge fast and that's using my PC USB port.*The case is slim. This is a big plus. They're also flexible and they don't seem like they would be easy to break, even without a case.Cons:*They are not noise cancelling AT ALL. I know this is a feature not a flaw, but you cannot hear the music at all if anything else is going on around you. I switch to my Raycon earbuds if there's external noise.*Not good for TV/Movies. I can't understand/hear dialog on these even though they work great for music. It's too quiet even on the loudest settings. I use my Raycons for dialog podcasts or shows. But they make my ears sweat and itch. I do prefer the comfort of these. These seem to work pretty well for phone calls though, so I'm not sure why the inconsistency. Even when it's quite around me I cannot hear a movie regardless of what platform I try them on.*They are MOSTLY comfortable. They do put some uncomfortable pressure on my ear tops over time, but that's hours. Also you can't really lean back in a chair or on a pillow with these as they don't sit flush on your neck. I got my son the regular and the mini for myself and he ended up getting minis too even though he has a huge head.*They do buzz a bit and it can tickle. I don't listen to high base. Mostly I use it for classical music to try to destress while I work. I don't find the buzz bad*The charger is proprietary  so don't lose the cord. And you have to bring the cord with. Not a problem for me as I only keep them at work.*When the battery starts to get low it constantly says ""charge me"" which I find annoying. Just say it once or twice and let them die. Don't repeat it every few minutes until it dies, which can be a good 20-30 mins after you get the warning.*It's not really a con, but these come with a headband. I couldn't figure out how it was supposed to be incorporated and turns out it's simply a headband. It doesn't wrap around them or anything. I think it's so that if you have long hair you can keep it back from under the conductive plates as they don't work well if there's anything keeping them from making contact with your skin. But I was confused until I googled what it was for.No idea how they work for sport or exercise because I'm fat and I don't run. But they seem pretty secure on my head.

    This product admittedly has a lot of cons, but the pros outweigh them easily. I will start with the cons first. The sound quality is subpar, the highest volume setting is not only underwhelming, but it actually shakes the whole earphone and you can feel the vibration around your ears. The person standing next to you can also hear whatever you are listening to if you have it turned up high enough.With all of this being said, this is by far the most comfortable headset you can buy. Yes, I prefer wearing these over any earphone by a mile, and even more than your most expensive, premium, cushy headphones. Why? Because after wearing these for a while, you actually forget these are even there. You can even lie down wearing them and they won't crush your ears if you lay on your side. This is the only headset I can wear for hours without my ears or head starting to hurt.They are also very secure, I have never had them fall off my head or even get close to it while at the gym. The fact they do not cover or enter your ear canal means you do not even need a transparency mode; you can easily hear everything around you.So who is this headset for? Well, if you are an audiophile who needs to isolate from their surroundings, then this is probably not for you. As for everyone else, especially athletes, this is perfect.

    I'm a heavy equipment mechanic/welder. I wear ear plugs all day every day. I have tried all other noise cancelling headphones on the market that can fit under a welding hood and PAPR. These work amazing. The music is actually clearer with hearing protection earplugs in. You can carry on a conversation with music playing in the background. We do a lot of carbon arc gouging and you can clearly hear the music while gouging. They take a few minutes to get used to because there is a slight vibration felt in your head. Another wider I work with who is elderly and wears hearing aids uses them. He says he can hear music like he's in his 20's again without hearing aids. They wrap around your ear and contact the skull behind your ear and by your side burn in the other contact point. I wear them with safety glasses and FR head sock with no issues. I can even carry on with a phone call under my welding hood while working and the person on the other ends never complains about background noise. They do get in the way with some head protection that uses a chin strap or has adjustable suspension that contacts the base of your skull. The only downside is the charging connection is magnetic and attracts grinding dust and metal shavings. Not the end of the world, just blow them off with compressed air. The battery lasts about 14 hours of music played all day. They charge in less than an hour. The pause/call button on the side is easily operated with heavy gloves on. You can walk about 200 feet away from your phone before they disconnect.

    It took a little getting used to the sound difference between these OpenRun Pros and my over-the-ear Bose QC35 headphones, but knowing the Pros wouldn't compare to the Bose, my expectations weren't all that high. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality. No, you're not gonna get that booming bass, but that's not what they're designed to do.It only took an hour or so to charge them up  and I expect to get more battery life than other similar phones. The app was very user-friendly. You can switch EQ settings between standard and vocal. The BEST part is how well they stay where they're supposed to stay. The band in the back is flush with the back of my neck. I have a HUGE (watermelon) head and they fit great...so much so that I can lay my head on a pillow and they stay on. My Samsung Buds2 Pro always fell out - even while just sitting or slowly walking. Frustrating! Again, not so with these OpenRun Pros.CAVEAT: It takes a bit getting used to repeat songs. The multi-function button does NOT protrude which makes it difficult sometimes to locate and then press 3 clicks for the repeat function to work. I'm sure with a bit more practice, I'll get it down (I just got them 2 days ago).All in all, I'm extremely pleased with this purchase. Go for it!

    Don’t expect them to cancel noise! THEY ARE MEANT FOR YOU TO LISTEN TO MUSIC AND STILL FOCUS ON YOUR SURROUNDINGS! THEY'RE AMAZING!!!!!!! Only 1 compliant.. sometimes when you go to charge the headphones it’ll indicate that they’re charging, but when you go to turn them on after they’re fully charged, the indicator will say “charge me” even when they’re clearly not connected to the Bluetooth, or turned on, they’ll still need to be “charged”. Just plug The headphones back in for 30min and they’ll be fully charged! Other then that they are SUPER COMFORTABLE! LONG BATERY! When purchasing the headphones it does say they last 10 hrs but really it’s more like 11&half to 12 hrs. Like the battery life is AMAZING!! And very COMFORTABLE!

    This one particular product came broken. However was returned without an issue. I have had this particular brand and use it every day all day. 15 minutes to charge fully, and talk on it for over a day. Super quality product. I've used it in the shower and had one on when the canoe tipped over... Completely submerged worked just fine for the rest of the day Even. I would buy this immediately if I lost another pair. I want two just for the purpose, and just to make sure I have one when it's charging. Sounds crisp, sharp and clear. Great base. Nose cancellation is high quality. It is difficult for your called party to hear you if it is a windy day though, but easily worked around.

    I’m a new runner and training for my first half marathon.  Music is my motivator so I need it to run.  I’ve tried a couple different ear buds and none of them stay in my ears.  Constantly jamming an ear bud in my ear while running was getting old.  I saw these and wanted to order them but was hesitant after reading a couple reviews about the charger and sound quality.  After talking to a couple people who absolutely love theirs, I finally decided to order.  When they came, I charged them and it was completely fine.  The magnet snapped right on and charged to 100% so I’m unsure the issue others were having with the charger.  I tried them out on an 8-mile training run and they worked beautifully.  They didn’t move, the sound quality was great, and I wish I had ordered sooner.  Of course they don’t have much bass but I’m ok with that as I don’t need bass while I’m running.  I could still somewhat hear what others were saying when I had them on, which is good because I like to stay aware of my surroundings on runs.

    I gather that these sound noticeably better than other bone conduction headphones, but those must be worse than mediocre given what I hear with these.  3 stars for mediocre sound, quirky controls, and not great value for the price (~$180 when I bought them, though they are less expensive as of this writing).  On multiple scores for this premium-priced model, I'm afraid Shokz over-promises and under-delivers.  Details follow.USE CASE (background info, skip ahead to SOUND QUALITY for product comments):  My use case for this was a little unusual - I wanted to listen to music from my phone in a car that lacked Bluetooth or aux-in.  Headphones seemed unsafe, FM xmitter not a reliable option due to lack of open freqs in my area, and upgrading w/an aftermarket stereo isn't worth it for a 10-yr old car that I plan to sell on fairly soon.  I thought bone conduction might be a good solution since it wouldn't block my hearing for traffic sounds, alarms, etc.  I read that sound quality wasn't the main strength of these athletic-oriented headphones, so figured I'd splurge and get the OpenRun Pro since it's consistently rated among the best in this category for sound quality (and I was avoiding the cost of a new car stereo after all).SOUND QUALITY:  First things first - to my ear the sound quality is perfectly fine for spoken word (audiobooks, podcasts, etc.) but not at all satisfying for music, lacking both bass and high end.  In one sense I'm glad I got these because anything with lower quality would be unacceptable for music and I'm not seeing any models consistently rated higher for sound; on the other hand, judged solely for spoken word, perhaps a less pricey option might have sufficed.  I think these are probably the worst sounding speakers or headphones on which I even try to listen to music (e.g., the affordable little Photive Hydra waterproof BT speaker I keep in my bathroom is much more pleasing).  I've also used these for a few phone calls and they sound great for that.  Folks on the other end seem perfectly happy with mic sound.ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:  Shortly after buying this Shokz I got the Oraolo M110 wearable (around the neck) BT speaker, and it worked far better as a  car audio solution than the Shokz, mainly due to superior sound quality (while still leaving ears open to hear the surroundings), for about a third of the cost (though in fairness it eventually had other issues).  If I'd thought to check that out first I'd never have bought the Shokz and saved myself some money; the Oraolo may not hold a candle to proper over-ear headphones, but its sound quality is head and shoulders above the OpenRun Pro.  The Oraolo had some quality problems with its switches that forced me to return it, but a holiday price cut on Sony's premium version of this tech (SRS-NS7) eventually got that to a price (little more than I'd paid for the OpenRun Pro, actually) that I could justify.  Anyway, because I use the neck speakers and the Shokz for similar purposes, I'll mention a few points of comparison in the following comments.UTILITY:  Despite the above, I do still use the OpenRun Pro with some frequency since I already have them.  They're great for listening to podcasts around the house without disturbing others or while driving, you barely notice you're wearing them (if I've paused the sound to deal with an interruption that goes on longer than expected I can completely forget they're on) - on that score they beat anything else I've owned.  Being worn directly on the head the sound is unaffected by head movements (an issue for neck speakers).  They're not as quiet for folks around you as, e.g., in-ear or over-the-ear headphones, but they're not at all loud in that regard, MUCH quieter than, e.g., neck speakers.Battery life is usable (at least a few hours), but not nearly the 10 hours they claim.  They certainly don't last as long as other BT headphones and speakers I have, but all this may be understandable given their size and weight.FEATURES/FUNCTIONS:  Apart from sound quality, this is where I have the most gripes.  Controls are on both left and right sides, with a single multi-function button on the left speaker used for play/pause/answer (1 click), FF (2 clicks), and REW (3 clicks), and a rocker on the right temple controlling power and volume. The problem with this arrangement is that it's so hard to time the 3 clicks for the rewind/skip-back function that it's nearly useless, with the headphones often doing a FF &  pause instead (so of course then you have to REW further...); I usually give up after one try and use my phone or smartwatch.  This would all work much better with a rocker switch in the left temple like the one on the right to control FF/REW, leaving the main button on the left speaker dedicated to play/pause/answer.  Awful design as it stands.More randomly, the OpenRun Pro sometimes just shuts itself off with an alert tone while in the middle of playing (so not a silence time-out, which they also do) - this seems to happen most often when using it with Roku remote listening, which can be inconvenient.  It does power right back up when you hit the right temple rocker switch .  I've noticed that this issue is addressed in the Shokz OpenRun troubleshooting guide with a recommendation to ""File a warranty claim"", but it doesn't happen all that often apart from the Roku app and recovery isn't that problematic.OVERALL:  There are some real advantages to this ultra-light non-isolating form factor and I see these are priced below $150 right now, but I'd shop around and check out some reviews for comparable models at lower prices, especially if you'll mainly be listening to podcasts or audiobooks.  For music, I really don't think any of these are likely to be much good given the current state of the art.

    These are my first pair of bone conducting earbuds, the sound is very good.  At full volume you can feel them vibrate by your ears.  They do leak sound at full blast which should be expected as they’re not in ear.  They also can be drowned out by excessively louder activities, like the pressure washing and engine noise I have at work.  The battery life for these is astonishing.  I have forgotten to charge them after a 10 hour work day and they’d lasted almost the whole second day, the fast charging also comes in handy in the event you forget to charge them.  Absolutely love these and will recommend them to friends and coworkers.

    Picked these up so that I would be able to hear the world around me on walks or around the house.  Sound quality is good and no issues when using them making phone calls.  Allows me to listen to podcasts/audiobooks without people noticing.  Music quality is good, though really notice the difference when switch over to over-the-ear headphones and you realize just how much bass is missing on these.  They can start to feel a little tiresome when over the ears for an extended time, but they slip down and around the neck easily, and can just slide them back on if receiving a call.  Very happy with these as they gave me all the things I was looking for.

    I don't review a lot of products, but I needed to share an experience. I bought these Open Run Pro's  a while ago and have really enjoyed them. The sound quality is good and they have stood up to my sweaty head. I wear them every day.  Recently the mic went out on them and I made a warranty request with Shokz even though I didn't expect much. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a new set several days later. I hadn't even seen the emails due to my email dropping them into a different folder. This was great customer Service despite my lax email response.

    Like the fact I no longer suffer from ear fatigue from pressure of buds in my ear. I operate a forklift and I can safely wear these while I’m working. You can hear conversations around you. You can hear all safety alerts or warnings. I’m really please With quality of sound. I will probably ever get another pair of in ear Buds. I can use Bluetooth connectivity with my phone, it’s a perfect fit for work. Great when I’m in the office or in hallways.

    I had to replace my beloved Aftershokz Airs after a sudden death that I was most unprepared for.*moment of silence*So I got the OpenRun Pros and they are fine replacements for the most part. What is disappointing is that the OpenRun Pros seem to be a little less enthusiastic about connecting to various devices via Bluetooth. The Airs were happy to bounce around from laptop to iPhone to portable speaker. In fact, they'd often get a little too enthusiastic and get frustrated if my iPhone and MacBook were both within range. The OpenRun Pros though...not so eager, and often when I do connect to my iPhone I have to fiddle around with things a bit to get the sound to actually come out of the headphones and not the phone itself.Beyond that I'm a big Shokz fan. For outdoor exercise like running there's nothing better or safer if you insist on wearing headphones. I have no trouble hearing approaching traffic or cyclists on the roads and trails. If you're an audiophile looking for awesome fidelity in your sound these won't do the job. What they will do, though, is provide clear and reliable sound for music, podcasts, audiobooks, phone calls, etc. while you're out there doing the work.

    I have several different styles of headsets. Most recently I went for the ear bud version from Samsung. But I didn't like wearing them for more than about 30 minutes. I gave these open run Shokz I try and I have absolutely no regrets. I did go for the smaller sized ones. I barely feel them on my head. And they work great in a room with low level noise. I couldn't recommend them for a room with a lot of ambient noise. But that's an okay compromise for me. There are other options if you need to be totally immersed in what you're listening to. But for everyday listening to audiobooks and music while working around the house, walking, etc. these are perfect!

    3 years ago I decided to try the open move by aftershokz headset, which was the cheapest version of this brand at the time. I fell in love with being able to wear these all day without having to remove and keep track of earbuds while I work.So when I finally broke my aftershokz, I debated between these and the beats powerbeats. I decided pretty quickly to go with these because I thought they would be an even better version of the aftershokz I already liked. This belief turned out to not be quite true.The good: these are more comfortable than my old ones and they have much better call quality. I always had problems with people hearing me on phone calls with my old pair, but these have no problem at all.The bad: The sound quality is worse than my old pair. Sound quality is never a strength with bone conducting technology, so I was disappointed to find out these were even worse than a cheaper pair from 3 years ago, but what was an even bigger disappointment was the battery life. My old pair was marketed as an 8 hour battery life while these are marketed as 10 hours, but these dont last nearly as long as my old pair. My estimation is that they die about 1-2 hours before my old pair. And pairing that with the fact that they have a proprietary charger make them even worse. My old pair would usually last the whole time I would be at work, and if they did die, it was a basic USBC charger. These have died all 3 days I have worn them to work, and I'm not carrying the charger because I don't want to loose it and have to order a new one.In conclusion, the battery life problem is too much of a deal breaker for me, so I am returning these and buying the beats. I would rather carry around a case for the earbuds and get better sound quality than have to take off and charge these in the middle of my work day.

    I have had my AfterShokz Trekz Air since early 2019 and have loved them and promoted them to everyone who asked or would listen. I only replaced them because the battery was not able to last all day any longer. The new model Shokz OpenRun Pro is nice, but the volume and therefore sound quality is not nearly as stron as the older model. I have not tried the new ones on a flight yet, but that was my favorite experience with the older models. I will try to remember to submit an update after my next trip.

    I live in a busy city so it is important to be constantly aware of my surroundings.  These make it so easy to go on long walks and runs throughout the busy city.  I feel so safe and secure with these on.  The battery life is so incredible and the fit is so comfortable.  I used to wear only one earbud or AirPod on at a time and I have totally stopped using it.  For everyone who walks or runs alone, these are so perfect to hear your surroundings

    I waited a year before giving a review. I also have never given anything on Amazon 5 stars, but I have for this. I work at a manufacturing facility. It's quite where I work (office) sound quality is fantastic (you get BASS!) but out on the floor I find music is it ,no podcats,unless you don't care about your hearing it will crank up. I will put them on in the morning and forget there even there physically,never has been an issue. 8-10 hours play time and still has plenty to go further. 30min tops for recharge for me. When I walk away from my phone it will automatically connect every time, so easy to use MONEY WELL SPENT!

    I'm really enjoying these headphones for their open design, allowing me to stay aware of my surroundings while walking on the street, which enhances both my enjoyment of music and my safety. However, my main gripe is with the proprietary charging cable. In an era where USB-C has become almost universal, the lack of it here feels like a missed opportunity for convenience. It's particularly inconvenient for travelers, as forgetting this specific cable can render the headphones unusable until you're back home. A switch to USB-C would make these headphones near perfect, combining great sound with the convenience of easy charging

    These headphones have been great. I have used them at the gym while weight training, and they stay on my head easily in the various different positions I get into. It has been useful to be able to have my ears open inn order to have a quick chat with someone (""are you using this?"" without taking out my headphones. On the flip side of this you do hear everything, so if your goal is to drown out your surroundings, this probably won't be your favorite. I think the sound is a bit of a compromise, but it is still surprisingly good. I have also use these as a backup to my work headset when my primary headset has run out of battery. People say they hear me wall and that the sound quality is good. My only CON is that I don't like that these headphones have a unique charger. It is yet one more thing I have to have. I would be much happier if it were a common plug, such as micro USB or USB-C. That being said, I don't have to charge it very often. The battery life is quite good!

    I do residential window cleaning, so I like to keep at least one ear open while working around customers' homes / my coworkers. I would normally rock the single earbud when on the job like most people, but when I saw these, I had to pick them up seeing the specific advantages. Now that they've been attached to my skull for close to 100 hours in the past month and a half, I figure it was time for a review.These were a no-brainer for me, given the hours of podcasts I tend to go through. To me it was worth the sacrificing sound depth in favor of having both ears open, yet being able to hear my audio in both ears. This is the first pair of headphones in general that has allowed me to have quick conversations without even hitting pause.Speaking of pause, I really appreciate the tactile pause / volume buttons. This was clearly a nod to the athletes they're marketed towards, and it's nice to not take off my gloves every time I need to pause, plus touch controls are useless in wet environments.I can't stress enough how comfortable these are. I had no clue how snug this type of ""bone conducting"" headphone would be on my skull, but they feel weightless. I wore these for 6 hours straight on a job, and they didn't bother me at all.Now for sound quality, the consensus among reviewers is pretty clear on these, and I would echo that. Don't even attempt electronic music. Heavier rock / metal is quite doable, you'll definitely get good vocals / mids, just know these do vibrate a lot with fuller sounding music and can feel a little odd especially at high volumes. You'll probably be pleased with anything acoustic. Podcasts / talk are the biggest win byfar with these.The case these come with is quite nice. I'm a little surprised they didn't find a way to put a battery into the case given the easily accessible magnetic contacts. It's not a deal breaker or anything, but the charging is proprietary, albeit ridiculously fast, but you are beholden to a single cable as your lifeline, so as long as you don't forget the cable for any long trips, running out of juice shouldn't be an issue. There have been days where I hastily plugged these in for 20 minutes before work after forgetting, and that was enough for them to go from ""battery low"" to ""battery high"" (those are just the voice prompts, I would guess it went from around 30% to 80%). Just hold on to that cable for dear life.Overall these headphones are well worth the money if you know what you're using them for.

    This is my fifth pair. First 3 pair, the skin covering didn't hold up on 2 pair. The 3rd pair the power button got stuck. The fourth pair the wire broke. They sound great and are very comfortable. They charge quickly. If I didn't like them, I would stop buying them because they are not cheap by no means. However, I wear them at least 8 hours a day, seven days a week. Earbuds fall out of my ears and you cannot hear what is going on around. These are also safe. I wouldn't recommend any other brand. I have bought others and they do not come close to Shokz sound, quality and safety.

    I've had several people ask me what I'm wearing. All I have to say is, ""Oh you gotta hear this."" And they are impressed.Great product.Very lightweight.Fits good over my glasses.Bluetooth connectivity/reconnect to my phone is really good.Good range - under 30ft through walls.Sound quality is better than I expected, except the bass (see note below). It's even better if I wear a sweat/head band down over my ears.Battery life is 8-10 hours for me, which is better than what I expected for the light weight.It's the little things...The proprietary charging cable/connector is short so I'll need to buy a longer oneThe vibration from the bass of some audio tickles my outer ear which is annoying and distracting, unless I wear a headband down over my ears.

    I had to order a second pair because one of the ear pieces broke off of the first pair. They seem to be fairly sturdy, so I suspect that there may have been a minor flaw or crack in the first pair. I work from home, so I wear these each day for meetings. I use MS Teams, and they work pretty good for that. They connect to my HP laptop through Bluetooth. I wish that the piece that connects the two ear pieces together was just a little longer. Right now the right ear piece puts too much pressure on the top front part of my ear and causes pain after several hours of use. Now for the good; The sound quality, both what I hear, and what others hear from me seems to be very good. I wear these from 8 to 10 hours each day, and the battery life is very good. It has been very rare that the battery has not lasted all day, and those times have been with very heavy use. The recharge time is very good, and if you need to get a little more use out of them you can do a quick 5 minute charge to get you through another meeting. I haven't timed how long it takes to get a full charge from almost empty but it seems to be about 40 to 60 minutes. I try to charge them up and them remove them from the charging cable so that they aren't charging all night. They have been left charging over night on a few occasions without a problem. So far, I have been very happy with them. I am thinking about moving up to the OpenComm UC version because my primary use for them is work meetings. The ability to mute with the button on the boom mic would be very helpful.

    I was an early adopter of the bone conductance headsets, tracing all the way to the original Aftershokz headset. While the company is reAirForce Talon SSnamed simply Shokz, the product has vastly improved.For voice-only applications, the sound quality is more than sufficient, both in terms of the microphone and the ""speakers."" This also applies to listening to audible books and podcasts.For music, however, one may find the bass a little lacking. With a tone generator, I can tell that a pure sine wave at 90 Hz is barely noticeable. This inspired me to use an equalizer to try to reproduce how music sounds like using a Hifiman Ananda driven by a humble Fosi DS1 amp. If I set the equalizer to start to roll off at 90 Hz (0 db) and down to -36 db at 36 Hz, then the audible experience is *about* the same.In reality, the OpenRun Pro does not sound quite as tinny because some lower frequencies can still be felt, but not heard. There is no easy way to configure the equalizer to quite reproduce this effect on a strictly air pressure wave headphone.If someone is expecting the same kind of sound quality as a normal headset in the same price range, there will be disappointment. If I want to really enjoy my music, the OpenRun Pro is definitely not my first choice. In a quiet room, the Hifiman Ananda + Fosi DS1 combo is hard to beat. In a noisy environment (vacuum cleaner, leaf blower, impact wrench, etc.), the Sony WF-1000XM4 with ANC or the Etymotic ER4XR are my choices.So when do I use the OpenRun Pro?When I just need some music ""in the background,"" especially when I am on the move. In a normal office, the OpenRun Pro sounds the best when it is at the medium level. Cranking up the volume seems to lose the balance between the high and low frequencies because the low frequencies are not as easy to reproduce/perceive. Some slow ambient music played through the OpenRun Pro really helps me get through a day of office work.Depending on the volume and genre of the music, I can carry on a conversation with my colleagues without pausing the music. Unlike the ambient mode of the Sony WF-1000XM4, there is no electronic pass through with distortion, conversations are just as natural as without wearing the OpenRun Pro.The OpenRun Pro is comfortable, too. I can wear it all day without feeling any discomfort. I also wear prescription glasses! As much as I enjoy the Ananda, WF-1000XM4 and the ER4XR, none of them is an all-day kind of headset (especially on a hot day). The battery life of the OpenRun Pro is superior, the battery level is still ""medium"" at the end of a long 12-hour work day (but I don't play music the entire 12 hours, although the headset is on all the time).Another benefit of the OpenRun Pro is that even when I am not listening to music, all the notification tones are played via the headset while I can hear everything in my surrounding. For example, in a meeting, I pause the music (some people speak very softly), but I leave the OpenRun Pro on. This way, I can get a calendar notification, but no one but myself hear it.

    So I tried a friends out and I liked them enough to order my own. However I wore mine for an extended period of time and they started to hurt the back side of my ears where the band touches. I tried to adjust them but they always went back to the spot of least resistance. Also when turned up the bass really tickles my temples, not a bad thing just funny. My last comment is the band that wraps behind my head is about 2 inches away from my head and I don't remember my friends fitting like that, I thought they were more snug. Maybe she had the mini?

    I work a week on week off 12 hour shift. It’s a operational job in a chair, and the ability to listen to audio books, podcasts, news, music all the while maintaining my hearing for the alarm sounds and radio conversation is a absolute must.These fit the bill so incredibly well, I loved them. The coworkers here started noticing and asking and they spread through our facility like an infection, now I’d say 7/10 guys here are wearing these. So many have them I never need to worry there’s a charger in every outlet lol,The only bummer was this Christmas 2023 my child borrowed them for a car ride to watch a movie on her present, and she lost them somewhere 2 hours from home, fell out of the truck I guess. I connected to them one last time via blue tooth (insane range) and then they disconnected so I think someone swiped them and left.I miss these headphones so much. Can’t really just go buy another pair for the price point right now.Audio is good. Heavy bass will vibrate and tickle your ears, Bluetooth connectivity is excellent you can walk away from your device and maintain the handshake, water resistance excellent, cleaning ability is easy, if you wear ear pro with these on they enhance the audio probably 125% better.Con is in a loud environment these become useless they can’t keep up with the noise and vibrations of a factory or anything, but if you put ear pro in they will, but if you do that you can’t hear anyone else so that’s a con.

    They're great for my daily walks on trails near my home. When I use regular ear buds I can't hear bicylists that yell to tell me when they're passing. The sound is great, but to me they're a little uncomfortable with glasses. The biggest downside for me is I can't use them for more than an hour or so. I have periodic migraines and the bone vibration seems to irritate my trimeginal nerve, which in turn triggers a migraine. If you have any facial neuralgia, this device is probaly not for you. It's an expensive thing to get only limited use from. I bought one for my husband as well. He loves his set and doesn't have any problem with it.

    My hearing was ruined by 35 years in an aircraft factory ... Tonight is the first time in 20 years that I'm able to understand the lyrics to songs  . The ringing in the ears is lessened also  .Through trial and error I found that putting unpowered headphones on over them brings a lot more sound  out .... I feel that this device is well worth the money .... Suggestion :  Someone put together something that both the bone-phones and a set of headphones could be listened too at the same time .  Thank-You SHOKS

    The sound is amazing on these things, I can't really tell the difference between these and a speaker in the room and they even work with earplugs in. The only thing I did was get a silicone pad to glue to the inside of each speaker head. So it can grip my head properly.

    Yes, this Shokz product is more expensive but there is a noticeable improvement over cheaper items. These are not the same as earbuds or expensive over the ear headphones, however, for bone conduction headphones, these are amazing. Five stars for this category of headphones.

    I can't stop using my head set. I use it at work, to workout and my daily stuff. It's definitely helpful when you need to be hands free and need to make phone calls. The great thing about it is that I can hear what others tell me while listening to music.  I recommend this to everyone

    I wear these for working out and traveling for obvious safety reasons. I love being able to hear what’s going on around me while listening to music or a podcast. Only issue is they fit weird on my ears and wish they had an adjustment to better fit.

    These bone conducting headphones are great when you want to listen to something fairly loud without having people around you hear. They are also great when using them to talk with someone on the phone. They can hear you clearly and you can hear them clearly. Very comfortable to wear and easy to pause when someone comes to talk to you at work. A lot faster to pause than trying to pause on your phone. I headphones that go in my ears, they always hurt after a few minutes or fall out, so these are the perfect headphones for me. I would recommend these to anybody and everybody.
