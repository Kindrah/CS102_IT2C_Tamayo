    We love this product and they work great.  They don't seem to scratch when I move them up/down or take them off -- at least we don't see any marks.  They hold up with all of our keys, scissors, cooking gloves, come cookware (splatter guard), etc.  Best thing that we so far we keep buying them keep things organized.

    These magnets hold so well that it a bit of a pull to remove them!  The hooks screw onto the base for use.  They work well inside and outside the RV and I would recommend them.

    I was surprised at how well these little gadgets work. I bought them for a different purpose, but I have put a couple on the inside of my front metal door for key storage and used a couple more to mount a sign on an entryway. Each one comes in two easy to assemble pieces, the hook screws into the magnetic base. Nice deal.

    (The 22 lb magnetic hooks I bought are no longer listed in the ad.  They are now selling 25 lb hooks instead.  Just something to keep in mind when reading calculations based on the 22 lb hooks I bought &  reviewed below.)  ***************************************************************************Among other things, I'm using these on three steel doors to hold the curtain rods that hold the curtains.  They are quite strong for their size (base is 1/2"" in diameter), and I'm very happy with their (parallel) holding power.  I docked one star for two hooks that don't fit in their base, demoting them to refrigerator magnets.Simply put, a magnet's PULL STRENGTH  measures (in kilograms or pounds) the amount of VERTICAL force  required to PULL the magnet AWAY from the metal surface it is stuck to.  Applying that to these magnetic hooks means that each one, when stuck to a metal CEILING, is rated for a maximum holding power of approximately 22 lbs/10 kg before it will PULL AWAY from the CEILING. (Assuming all CONDITIONS ARE IDEAL.)Take the same magnetic hook and put it on a WALL made of exactly the same material as the ceiling, and it will SLIDE DOWN the wall much easier than it will PULL AWAY from the ceiling (or PULL AWAY from the wall, for that matter).  This is the magnet's PARALLEL HOLD or SHEAR FORCE, and it's not nearly as powerful as its PULL STRENGTH.  This same concept explains why 2 magnets stuck together are easier to separate if you SLIDE them apart than if you try to PULL them apart.Manufacturers are generally referring to  PULL STRENGTH  when stating the holding power of a magnet.  Pull Strength is determined by the MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF WEIGHT A MAGNET HELD WHEN TESTED UNDER IDEAL CONDITIONS.  PARALLEL HOLD/SHEAR FORCE can be reasonably estimated at 10% to 25% of a magnet's PULL STRENGTH.  With that in mind, we'll assume a PARALLEL HOLD of 17% for these magnetic hooks rated at 22 lbs (22lbs X 17% = 3.74 lbs).  Under that assumption, we can expect that each hook (if used on a metal WALL or DOOR) should hold approximately  3 3/4  lbs of weight before it SLIDES DOWN THE WALL.  Obviously, that's much less than its stated pull strength of 22 lbs (the amount of weight it should hold if used on a ceiling).  Because a magnet fails under less weight when used on a wall rather than a ceiling, or holds less weight than stated on packaging or sale ads, does NOT mean that the magnet is flawed or the manufactuer and sellers are deceitful.  The magnet is simply demonstrating, in real life, (and perhaps to the user's dismay), the difference between its PULL STRENGTH (22 lbs in this case) vs its PARALLEL HOLD/Shear Force (approximately 2 1/4 to 5 1/2 lbs = 10% to 25% of 22 lbs).In addition to orientation, there are other factors or conditions that influence a magnet's performance/strength/holding power, SUCH AS:THE MAGNET:  **What is the magnet made of, what type of material?  (ceramic, alloy, rare earth, etc),  **What is the magnet's CONDITION?  (chipped, cracked, scratched, dirty, etc)  **What is its size and shape?  **Is the magnet ""CUPPED"" or not?  Cupped=magnet is placed into a steel 'cup' or 'holder', like the  magnets on these hooks.  Cupping 'focuses' most of the magnet's pull in one direction [the open  end of the cup], giving it more holding strength than it would have without the cup.  **How has the magnet been HANDLED?  Has it been stored correctly (it matters)?  Has it been dropped? (dropping magnet=not good)ENVIRONMENTAL:  **What is the AMBIENT temperature and humidity level?  Is there excess moisture present?  **Will the magnet be completely submerged, used to attract submerged items?  **What is the temperature of the metal the magnet will attach to? - What is the temperature of the magnet?THE METAL:  **What of the metal the magnet attracts or attaches to? - How thick is the metal?  (thicker = better) - What are its components?  **What is the condition of the metal item or surface?  Is it BARE and CLEAN or is it coated, painted, dirty, greasy, rusty? - Is it perfectly FLAT or is it curved or uneven?  Is it perfectly SMOOTH or is it textured, rough, bumpy, dented, chipped?ANYTHING THAT INTERFERES WITH 100% FULL & DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN MAGNET AND METAL DIMINISHES THE MAGNET'S HOLDING POWER.~~~and that's just the short list, there's more, and it ALL matters.I think the physics of magnets and magnetism is fascinating, but technical and complex enough to blow MY  mind right out of the science book!  Fortunately, for most of us 'average consumers', this very BASIC understanding of PULL STRENGTH as it relates to PARALLEL HOLD is likely the most beneficial (and easiest to remember) when choosing a household, craft, hobby or shop magnet for your particular task.  *********************************************************************************NOTE:  IDEAL CONDITIONS for testing a magnet's holding power means the METAL is thick, perfectly smooth and flat, perfectly clean and bare. Same for the MAGNET, it is in PERFECT, new condition.  Ambient conditions [temp, humidity, dust-free, etc] are also PERFECT.  Everything is as perfect as it can be in order to achieve the maximum holding power of the magnet, and that result is what is stated on packaging, in ads, etc.  Our personal-use conditions are not likely to be as perfect as testing conditions.

    Not a problem with the magnets themselves, they definitely held strong on my fridge.But I bought these for a cruise because the walls are metal, and they stick to the wall, but they can really only hold jewelry and maybe your lanyard if you use 2.

    These work great on a cruise ship to organize and fan clothing items out for better drying. They are small enough to not take up any space in your luggage. Yet super handy in your stateroom. On Royal Caribbean the walls and the ceiling are metal and these hold on tight.We put a few on the walls to hang sunglasses, hats, etc. Then a few on the ceiling to hold swim suits, t-shirts, or anything else that got wet. This allows the air to circulate around the items and dry them out much faster that hanging them on a wall or door hook.I wasn't sure if these would hold well given their small size. They do! Especially when used on the ceiling. They are tough to pull off. When used on the wall, they hold much less weight as they tend to slide down the wall if much more weight that a hat or light purse. All in all, a great buy.

    These are pretty small. You won’t hook cooking utensils on them unless the handles are very thin at the end with the holes. They have Avery strong magnet for their size. I wanted to attach a fly swatter to the side of my fridge so it is perfect. Also worked well for hanging up dish towels.

    I use these to hang on the wall in our cabin on our cruise. They’re very sturdy and held my hoodie, my small purse, my room, key, etc. helped to keep things organized and close reach.

    My son asked ""has anyone purchased hooks for the cruise?""  I thought we would never use them but got these anyway.  I was quite surprised at how handy they came in.  I used it to hang jewlrey, hats, lanyards, and even balloons that we wanted to put out of reach when it got close to bedtime for the grandkids.

    I purchased these to take on a cruise. Looking at the picture they looked so much bigger. The amount of weight they hold was fantastic.So I'm not saying it's a bad product as it is a very strong magnet.  So that is why I gave it a 5 star.What I'm saying is it's way too small to use to hang a shirt so if your looking for this to pack for your cruise these are too small. The picture is misleading.

    I was surprised at how much smaller these hooks are than the actual photo. The size is actually about 1/2 - 1/3 of the photon size. I use them on the metal surface of the hot water heater in the garage to hang items like hats, small extension cords, and other commonly used items that I keep misplacing grrr.....%^&^**.No way this thing will hold 22 lbs.But for $8, I will keep them.

    I like these. I got the bronze/coppery color in the 10 pack. They're plenty strong for their size. I have them in 2 rows on either side of the fridge. Mailbox key on one, 2 small flashlights on another, tacking up papers or appointment reminders, and another keeping a dish towel up where the puppy cant reach it.

    Ordered this for an upcoming cruise to anchor an organizer to the door and also to hang random items in the room. I should've read the description more thoroughly, and that's on me, but I literally laughed when I received them. They are teeny tiny! But with that said, they seem pretty strong and will work for what I need them for. Just carefully look at the measurements on them before ordering! :)

    I needed it to hold a jacket hanging from my tall metal file cabinet at work.  Strong enough hold a medium size winter jacket.  Gave it 3 stars instead of 5 for ""Easy to Remove"" because once it's on, it's on.  It's really hard pick it up, you have slide it off the edge.

    Purchased for a cruise but didn’t use them because our stateroom had plenty of storage and hooks for just the two of us.  I’m keeping them to use in other places; in the garage, the laundry room, the RV, on my dog grooming station.  So many uses!

    This is a follow up to my 1st review.  If you put on the fridge or filing cabinet with the hook sticking out, only small items. To get max weight load,  must hang where the hook is hanging down. Went to another site to find this out.

    These magnets are surprisingly strong.  They are smaller than I expected them to be, and they come in a very compact package.  I'm taking these on a cruise vacation where I can use them to hang miscellaneous things in my stateroom.

    I am an avid stitcher and always struggled with a neat way to display my current project floss. It dawned on me that I use a garage metal cart as my stitching “station”…they have solved the problem!Sturdy, easily moved to another spot, but a strong grip. They come separated, easily reassembled with the screw hook. No problem with the thread on the hooks.It’s the little things 😁

    I bought these to use on our cruise. While it didn't hold what I needed it to, it worked for hats, Lanyards and light weight bags. They came separated, but were easy to put together

    We recently took these 2lb magnetic hooks on our cruise, and they were an absolute game-changer for keeping our cabin organized and clutter-free. Whether it was hanging up wet swimsuits, securing our day bags, or just keeping random items off the ground, these hooks held up incredibly well. Their strength and durability were impressive, considering the variety of items we hung on them. Highly recommend for any travelers looking to make the most out of limited space!

    They're very small.  We're going on a cruise in 2 days and I tried them here at home and will probably have to use 2 together to insure they can hold up to the weight they advertised.

    They work better putting them straight up under something with the weight  pulling down , but when you put them sideways on something like a refrigerator they slide down ,with just a small amount of weight .

    I bought these for a cruise and to use at home. The metal walls and ceiling of the cruise ship allow use of these magnets. These are good for the ceiling but have a tendency to slide down the wall if your hanging a shirt or trousers. I suggest a stronger magnet for vertical walls.

    We are using these on a cruise to hold our swim suits, towels, etc. They are perfect for that. I also used them in my classroom to hang vines around the room. I don't put too much weight on them, but I have never had to reposition them or take anything off because they couldn't handle it.

    I love the small powerful hooks. Perfect and just what we were looking for. Self assemble. Pen for size comparison.

    Bought these hooks for upcoming cruise. Tried them at home first and they are really strong and held garments perfectly! Hope they work as well in my cabin.

    These are very small hooks. Small magnet too. They only work if you are going to hang something from a metal shelf or other horizontal surface. If you try to hang them on  a vertical surface such as a wall, it takes about a pound to make them slide down. They slide fairly easily on horizontal surfaces but as long as your weight is going to hang straight down they work.

    These hooks stick in place and STAY in place! I have hung coats, price guns, keys, even a laptop once
