    Once the rubber part comes off, there’s a small plastic part remaining with a screen on it- you must pop this off or the tip won’t fit.  (See photo)

    First, everyone’s ears are different. I sleep with ear plugs and they stretch my ear canal opening. The iPhone's Ear Tip Fit test failed initially, but I had to shove the tips deeper into my ear canal to get them to have a successful test. Not too large of an issue. I have one ear that fails the test no matter what, but my version 1 AirPod Pro may just be too old.The photos I uploaded show a comparison with the old Apple tip. In the photos, Apple's has an “M” for medium on the side and they are dirtier. You can see this new non-Apple model flares out a little at the bottom. It’s also deeper (farther out from the side). The Apple model has a thicker flare height but thinner distance from side. So, the new tip doesn't go as deep into the airpod when snapping into place. I used my fingernail to get it to go into the channel.Another note about this entry, when looking at the photos for this product, you’ll see there is no flare at all, but it’s not what you get in packaging as my photos show. However, the fit test is still successful for me, so I don't think that's an issue.Lastly, you’ll see the sound hole is smaller in the new model, but I can’t tell a sonic difference in sound quality. i just wanted to point out that the difference is not important in case you notice it.As another reviewer mentions, Apple does sell their own tips, but they don't offer a multi-size kit like this. I did purchase one of those to see if they'd work for my earbud that keeps failing the test, and their design is actually different than the original that came with my version 1 AirPods. The design is actually closer to these -- making it not anymore valuable to purchase outside of Amazon.So, overall, a worthy buy for a multi-size set. Priced right. Ships lightening fast. Good packaging. Great to have a case. Definitely recommended.

    The material and the sizes are different from Apple. The material feels cheap, and size are slightly bigger than apple’s original. And the noise cancellation got weaker, not sure if it’s because the fit and the thinner material or just my AirPod getting old.

    I like the fact that they fit , I’ve had my pros for a year and had so many issues with keeping them in my ear (I have small ears) I wasn’t aware you can change the buds until I was told so I purchase these and trying them out I can finally keep them in my ear , I’m just a little mad that the bud falls off the ear bud when removing it from my ear I thought I was doing it wrong I have long nails so my sister helped me and it was the same thing ! I say 50/50 because I’m happy they work but sad that the bud cap falls off .

    I’ve read the negative reviews and quite honestly, I have no idea where these people are coming from. I was very skeptical when I ordered these but they are a much better product than the OEM tips I had. In particular the noise cancellation on the OEM AirPods was never very good (particularly when flying) and I could never get the volume high enough to mitigate the outside noise. However these replacements are perfect and made a huge difference in the noise cancelation department—didn’t need to increase the volume on my AirPods to maximum volume in a noisy environment for the first time since I’ve owned the AirPods.

    They seem a bit flimsier that the original set, but I've been using this set for a couple months now and they are working well. I'm not terribly picky on sound quality (mostly use for web conferencing) but the sound seems as good as Apple tips.

    Lost one tip. Replaced it with these… they aren’t 100% match but that may be bc I’m used to the original. Feel like the replacement one is a bit stiffer than the original.

    The tips on my airpods had a tear at the base and wanted a replacement as quickly as possible. These were going to get here a bit faster than if I ordered the Apple brand from Apple, so decided to give them a try. They attached and work just like the originals, and I don't notice any difference in sound or functionality. Highly recommend if you can't get a hold of the Apple brand versions.

    I used another set from a different vendor and they kept sliding out. This time I also used a smaller size and I rarely deal with them falling out. Definitely much more happy with this set.

    I was a little iffy about ordering a different brand other than Apple. Well I’m glad I did because I ended up liking them way more than the original ones my pods came with. They don’t slide out of my ears and don’t dry out my ears the way Apple ones did. Will repurchase once my current ones give out

    As others have noted, you need to remove the white extra plastic piece on the Airpods to install. This caught me off guard and required a tweezers to remove. After than, install was easy.
