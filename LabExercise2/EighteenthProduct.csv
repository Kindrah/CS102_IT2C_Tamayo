    These glasses were great!  They were sturdy enough to survive a day in my backpack & still provided clear, safe views of the eclipse!  I highly recommend them!

    These were shared with those who passed by and also wanted to view the eclipse October 14th, 2023! They covered eyes well and stayed put & did not fall off. Provided safe viewing of the eclipse.

    They look like they should work fine. Should also fit over most eyeglasses as well. Actually read that they should be under your glasses.Important,! They are the correct ISO certification 12312-2For the low price its a good deal.

    Great product that works as advertised.  We used these glasses to view the October eclipse and they worked perfectly.  They allowed us to safely view the eclipse and are sturdy enough to use again for the April eclipse.  Would buy again if we needed more eclipse glasses.

    We used the glasses to look at the last solar eclipse. They worked so well and we were able to look directly at the sun without any issues at all. Even wear regular glasses under the solar glasses. These glasses made our experience so much more enjoyable and we were able to have a homeschool class about the solar eclipse and talk about safety along with the glasses. It's was great.

    These glasses worked great! We bought them to view the eclipse this past October and were so pleased that we decided to buy more for the upcoming April Eclipse. We passed extras out to people in the park last time and want to be able to do it again.

    My husband and I both had great success in viewing the eclipse last October. We all wore them over our regular glasses. I was even able to take a picture with my iPhone with the lense covering the camera.  My dad shared his pair with friends at a rehab facility so they all could view it too. We were all very pleased with how they worked so weâ€™ve saved them to watch the next eclipse. Thank you!

    I didn't order them in time for the eclipse, but I have tested them on the sun at different times of day. I feel comfortable letting my kids use them this April for the eclipse in TX. Happy with my purchase. I may possibly tape some paper on the sides to make sure my younger kids don't try to look out the sides where the glasses arms are, but might not. Just will have to see.

    Excellent solar glasses! I'm so glad I chose to get these. They were the best price point and the coolest design format imo. I was worried they might not be able to protect my eyes well enough or that I might miss some of the viewing but everything turned out perfectly! I couldn't be happier. Thanks again.

    I ordered these glasses for the eclipse in October 2023. They arrived on time and in a nice little box to protect them. They are very sturdy, a decent thickness of cardstock on the frame. Not sure how they would fit on little kids, we used them for adults and teenagers. Overall a very good purchase.

    The Helioclipse glasses are great. The protective film is very dark and your eyes are well protected. Go to your preselected viewing spot, put them on and look up, but donâ€™t walk while wearing. I wish the arm on the frame was a little longer as I put them over my regular glasses! Just be careful the eclipse glasses are secured over your eyewear frame.

    My family watched the last near total solar eclipse with these, and they held up great! Rather than having to share between us, we all got to sit in some lounge chairs and enjoy the show. Would definitely recommend.

    Helped turn my son's first eclipse into an even more spectacular day as we used these, a pinhole viewer, and a cereal box viewer to see the eclipse. Absolutely worth. They feel pretty durable (surprisingly so) but we didn't put them through much stress. The glasses sit on a shelf with our other viewers awaiting the next eclipse.

    I Can look directly at the sun while wearing these. They are good for one time use as they are typical cardboard frames and wonâ€™t hold up to heavy use. Perfect for eclipse viewing.
