    The style color and comfort are as good as it gets! This chair fits my man cave/office perfectly! It's very comfortable and has great style. I'm a 6'2"" and 205 and it holds me easily! The footrest is a great addition and is great for relaxing in style! This chair seems to envelop you in comfort!

    Ordered this to replace an old chair, and I'm glad I did.It is easy to assemble--unless, like me, you infer from the illustration of each part by itself that it must be missing the head and lumbar cushions. It's not; they come in the box already in place, and you need only adjust their position to taste. Two other tips:1.  Put the rubber rings on the ends of the assembly and let them stay for a day before you take them off, slide the rest into position under the chair, and put them back on. That made it much easier for me to get them in place with the rest beneath the chair seat. (Alternatively, you might choose to ignore the order of assembly in the manual and put the foot rest on before you place the seat on the base.)2. Double check the tightness of the plastic tubes before you install the foot rest, or you'll have to take the foot rest off, tighten, and put the foot rest back on.That said, it's comfortable, and I appreciate the head and lumbar cushions greatly. I'll update if/when the hydraulic cylinder gives out.... and sure enough,UPDATE: the hydraulic cylinder is indeed dead. It doesn't even rise and then promptly sink when I sit on it. This is quite disappointing. Looking for a replacement--inclined not to ask SITMOD for one, because they gave me the one that failed in relatively short order.

So I shopped around for weeks before finally biting the bullet and getting this one. I did NOT want to spend over $100 on a gaming chair, but this is the world we live in and now I’m actually really glad I did. Pretty darn good chair if you ask me. I got it for work because I am fully remote. And I play a lot of sims4. It’s comfortable and I like it a lot. Bit stiffer than I anticipated, but easy to put together and solid for the price point. The low back pillow comes in clutch, but the massage feature is loud so I never plug it in. You can tell it’s a bit cheaper because the cushions are very light weight and not exactly cushion-y. It’s about as cushioned as a block of styrofoam.  The fabric quality and color is spot on though and the foot rest is a great touch, so far I use it every day. I’m 5’0” and wanted something I could fit in and sit cross legged or on my knees when I get restless at my desk and this does the trick.One thing I do really wish was different is the reclining feature. It’s either locked in one spot or unlocked and reclines alll the way back. My chair at work had three settings on that so I could stop it from reclining all the way but still rock. With this had that feature. Still love it though and would recommend it if you’re trying to save money!

    I bought this chair in 2023 and it actually only lasted about 6 months before breaking.  I'm only writing this review now because I've exhausted myself looking for options to fix it and have come up with nothing.  So here I am, lets start with a general review.First, the chair is quite nice, it looks and feels good, meshes well with my set up, and the massager/pillow combo it came with are a great bonus addition.  The footrest... Exists, and over all the chair felt sturdy, we'll come back to this, when I first built it.One of the first issues I noted was the seat as it very quickly became uncomfortable.  I was able to address that with a cushion I had purchased for my last chair but I understand most people won't have that.  The second issue was quite a surprise as I didn't know it was an issue until I was looking up at my ceiling.  The frame of the chair is extremely cheap, despite being made of metal, and bent until it broke without my realizing it.  I'm specifically talking about the part where the pneumatic tube, if that's the right word for it, connects to the seat of the chair.  Sometime back in October I was watching a show and stood up only for the seat to rise.  At first I thought the release had slipped so I checked the bar but it wasn't working at all.  Deciding that it wasn't that big of a deal I moved on with my life until the next day when it wouldn't raise at all.  I keep the chair low so I didn't really care at that point and sat down, that was a mistake.  As I lay there looking at the ceiling, cursing my old body, I began to wonder what had just happened.  I lifted the chair and noticed that the seat and back combo were wobbling so I took a look under to find that the metal housing around the pneumatic tube was bent and broken.  From the looks of it, the welding went first and then the metal bent and cracked around it.  I don't remember hearing anything that would make me worry about that so I really don't know when or how it happened.  I'm well within the weight recommended for the chair as well so I highly doubt it was a weight related issue either.  Still, I was overall satisfied with the chair and decided to see if I could just buy a replacement part but I had no luck finding it.With that being said, I cannot in good faith recommend this chair.  I mean, it might be okay for like a ten year old but then I'd also worry about safety considering the cheap construction.  On top of that, this is a fairly pricey chair if its only going to last for six months, give or take, of mild use.  I recommend anyone reading this look elsewhere and I hope you find that perfect seat.

    I'm a big sim racer and wanted something more comfy to replace my dying chair. This thing is comfy guys. The chair feels really well made and the foot rest is sturdy. Just don't make a dumb mistake like me and put the o rings on before you slide the footrest in place. Make sure you put them on AFTER. Will be getting more o rings tomorrow. Great product and worth the money.

    Going to keep this simple..Pros:Sturdy seatNice material & colorLumbar & neck pillows are comfy and supportiveCons:Feels a bit small unless you're sitting uprightButt portion of the seat is made of thin material and feels like sitting on a wooden chair after a bitLeg attachment is very weak and will break eventuallyWheels are pretty stiff compared to most other chairsI'm about 50/50 on this chair. It looks nice and feels nice but I wouldnt recommend this for an ""all day"" chair.

    I purchased this chair about 4 months ago, and it is extremely nice and comfortable. I would recommend because not everyone will have my experience, but what I will say is the parts seem old and/or cheap. I cant seem to find a support page to get a hold of these guys otherwise as their website just brings me here. I have to replace the piston as it started sagging.. Then apparently the plastic around the cylinder just broke into 5 pieces at the top of the piston where the chrome metal starts to be exposed because of that now the bolts to the left arm are messed up from the offset seating and long gaming sessions so those have to be replaced and my last complaint is the lumbar pillows like flat as cardboard now. even with constant fluffing. Otherwise this chairs been great. Just glad my and half month pregnant girlfriend didnt sit in it when the piston popped on us..

    It's decent, i wouldn't put anyone or anything that weighs 200lbs in it. I tried sitting in it and using the foot rest to see what it was like, and the foot rest felt kind of flimsy.But it was perfect for my little sister, who only weighs around 100-120lbs.

    I received this chair today. Overall, the chair is comfortable. It took me less than 30 minutes to put together. The directions were easy to follow and I was able to assemble it myself rather quickly. I will update the review after using it for a few months. The fabric has a soft woven feel and the cushioning feels firm. All the holes lined up nicely to screw everything together. I wanted a gaming style chair to have more head support when sitting at my desk all day and this chair does provide the extra support I was looking for.

However, I'm pleased to report that the absence of guidance didn't hinder the assembly process. In approximately 20 minutes, I successfully built the chair from scratch without any major challenges. To those who claim this chair is too complicated to assemble, I'd suggest brushing up on your DIY skills – it's a straightforward process, even without instructions.The chair comes with all the necessary bolts and an Allen wrench, making the assembly hassle-free. The stitching on the chair is impeccable, giving it a premium look and feel. One delightful surprise was the spacious seat – it's wider than expected, promising a comfortable gaming experience even during marathon sessions.The inclusion of a footrest adds an extra layer of luxury, providing optimal support for extended gaming or work periods. The ergonomic design is evident, ensuring that every aspect of the chair contributes to a comfortable and enjoyable seating experience.In conclusion, the SITMOD Gaming Chair has won me over with its comfort, ease of assembly, and stylish design.

    As a slightly short woman I have been looking for an office chair that fits, gives support for my tailbone & hips, as well as giving me lumbar support that I can adjust to my needs, and this chair has delivered on all of those things! Do be aware that the depth of the lumbar pillow cuts into the actual length/depth of the chair's seat. I wasn't sure I would ever use the foot rest but have found that when I do several hours of gaming it has come in very handy to elevate my feet. The only two drawbacks that I have experienced thus far is that the head-rest pillow doesn't come down far enough due to my short stature; my neck hits the chair about where the sides flare out, and the tilt handle is too far down and back to use it without leaning far over and back - if I had extra long arms there would be no problem, and that is why I only gave it a 4-star rating overall.  The seat is quite firm, which I like but others might find it too hard. With the instructions there were several issues: (#1) because I put this together by myself I did not put the wheels on until the whole chair was together, (#2) test the bolt placement for the underside mount of the chair BEFORE anything else [had to send 1st chair back due to them being to far apart], (#3) instructions are not at all clear as to how to bolt the foot rest onto the frame so do not put rubber gaskets on the frame ends UNTIL you have tried sliding frame into holders beneath the chair seat and seeing if the foot rest will stay put and will then flip up. In my review pictures I have 3 showing how the foot rest should be. I like that the lumbar pillow can be moved up-n-down without it falling out, also if you are not going to use the vibrator you can pull it and its USB cord out through the pillow's zipper. I like the material as well, it is not rough on your arms-n-elbows and it is cooler than the fake leather of my old chair. Although this is a tad more expensive than a regular office chair I fell that it is well worth it - just wish it were made here in the USA and not in China where that gov't gets a slice of every business' sales. I looked for one made here but not able to find any even though a few of the really expensive ones are USA companies.

    the seat has hardly any cushion, it is better to sit on a metal folding chair. If you are a bigger person the sides of the back will squeeze and hurt you. The lumbar support does nothing if you plan to recline the chair at all.The seller is very willing to work with you to get a suitable product weather it be an upgrade or a refund for your purchase. They did everything to solve the situation. I did not like the chair but my petite niece enjoys the chair very much. Please know a bigger person will not be comfortable in the chair but if you are on the smaller side the chair can be a nice asset for a very good price.

    The fabric seems nice.  As a bigger guy, it feels stable enough to support me but overall it's a pretty uncomfortable fit since the bucket seat style kind of hugs the hips similar to a race car seat. Also, the stitching is really bad in terms of the logo. So bad that I thought my chair was uneven and spent an additional 30 minutes trying to figure out why. Turns out, the company name goes up and to the right at a slight 10⁰ angle if not a little stronger. Just enough to seem like a factory mess up and also enough to bother anyone with OCD.It came with a pillow for lumber support and a head pillow (likely to hide that offset logo stitching). I plan on using the pillow to hide that embarassing uneven logo from my viewers eye sight while I stream but otherwise, it's not too terrible of a chair. Definitely a ""you get a little less than what you pay for"" situation though. Big quality drop when compared to the GT Racing chair it's replacing.

    Lets start with the basics of this chair i have own this chair for almost 2 weeks now.. its a decent height with fair amount of room on the cushion on the bottom when im gaming or typing up something on the computer i have no discomfort but im not exactly comfy either. its like a fair medium for long periods of gaming i game in sessions of about 2-6 hours at a time depending on the day so i can assure you its not a hunk of junk the back massager is a good bonus but i haven't really used it much i plugged it in and i didn't feel much of a difference (I have a back condition) the top extra is nice i will say, i use it often when i recline in it now when i recline in it i dont exactly feel secured but it hasn't broke down on me yet it feels like you're falling in a sense but i am also a larger and tall man so it could just be me now the footrest personally i think its not that great now. if you dont recline and pull it out it feels very flimsy and could break it like fragile so im a little upset with that feeling but when you recline back and use it it does feel sturdy and if you're like me and want to put your feet up without laying on your back from time to time this chair is not for you i would invest the extra 100$ and get something more well known for quality if thats the case the arms i will say not very good the left arm i have 0 problems with but the right arm constantly gets loose on me and i have to keep tightening it about every 3 days but overall i dont have to many complaints with this chair its great if you're on a budget or just want something straight forward this chair is a good fit for you or even a back up chair but if you got the money i would invest in the more expensive chairs for quality but this chair does have its looks and strengths but the downsides are a concern for people like me

    Super easy to assemble. The bolts that hold in the leg rest part come loose consistently and were unfortunately recently lost in my move and im unsure what size bolts, but I suppose I'll have to replace them. When the leg rest is out and chair is leaned back the leg rest bends down considerably and it feels like If I use the full top part of the chair it will topple over. The arm rests keep bending well out of place and I quite literally have to snatch them back to their normal position. I like the thought. I like the assembly, but def some errors that need to be upgraded for it to be much better for its intended use.

    This chair is great if you're a child or child sized but if not the arm rest is not your friend. It's much too low for an adult. I'm only 5'10 and after a hour or two my shoulders are killing me. My partner is 5'4 and the arm rest is too low for even him.Giving it a 3 star because I'll admit the seat padding is comfortable enough for hours of gaming and because it's a affordable game chair. But the arm rest is really a buzz kill. Perhaps they should try making it higher or at least adjustable.

    This chair is comfortable, but hours of sitting on it can leave you feeling uncomfortable. The leg rest doesn’t nearly go out as far as my legs do, so it’s just an awkward position to be in. The arms get loose extremely quickly too, so they just wobble around.

    Spent 2 months researching for a good gaming chair on a budget, since I started a little gaming set up. Have to say, I had my doubts because you can’t obviously buy a high quality chair on a budget BUT I’ve been using it for a couple of months now and I have to say I’m surprised of how nice it is. It gets a little uncomfortable on your behind after a couple of hours, if I’m being honest, but overall it gets the job done. It’s simple, pretty and the name of the brand looks good comparing it to others. It’s also pretty wide and you can adjust it nicely for your comfort. The material looks and feels durable and chair overall is very sturdy.

    When I was looking for a replacement for my racer type gaming chair, I was looking for comfortability and a foot rest, as I tend to game between 2-4 hours (depending on the game I'm on).  The SITMOD chair, while the fabric is really nice, isn't super comfortable due to the lack of cushion. Obviously, when you're sitting in a spot, it's going to form a dent, but because of the lack of cushion, you end up feeling the hard plastic bottom that supports overall.I am in the hunt for a new chair, though I may stick to finding that in-store moreso than shopping for it online.It would be a good chair short term. But if you're planning for long term, you either want to buy a chair cushion pillow or continue looking.

    Bolt holes weren’t threaded properly left a lot of loose gaps and caused a lot of stripped screws because of the poor Allen wrench they supplied. Would’ve went with a different chair personally if I ordered a new one. Especially for a chair that’s almost $200

    This chair took about 45 minutes to assemble. The leg rest seems pretty flimsy. I will probably never use it because I feel like it would start droop down. Material of the chair is nice. Over all I'm happy w/ what I paid and the chairs' quality.

    My husband had an awful time putting the right arm rest together as the screw hole was not threaded all the way through and at an angle. He was able to fix it because he is has extra parts, but it caused alot of unnecessary stress on his part. Other than that it is quite nice very comfortable and glad assembly is behind us. I'm very glad my husband is so awesome or I would have had to return the whole thing because I wouldn't have thought about it. 4 out of 5 would have been 5 out of 5 but assembly wasnt hell.

    The wheels really don’t like to spin and for some reason it hits a point and both sides of the wheel pops off easy to put back on but kinda annoying

    I've had this chair for about 6 months now. Using it for a work chair.  The support is gone.  It's like sitting on the floor in terms of hardness, at the end of the day my butt hurts so bad. It also is at a point where it is hard to not slide off the front of the chair because it leans forward.  I'm waiting for my next bonus to be able to buy a different chair.

    I have been sitting in a horrible office chair to game for some time and this is a huge upgrade. Arrived in a big box (my cat is super happy) and was so easy to assemble. Pretty sure it took maybe 15 minutes. I use it all the time and love it. I don't use the leg rests as much as I was expecting but it is still a nice added feature. It also comes with a vibration option that requires you to plug the chair in. I honestly had no idea it came with that option when I purchased it. TBH its not that great. But its a nice feature to have.My only con about this is the chair is fairly stiff when you first use it. It does loosen up over time and becomes somewhat more comfortable and I have no major issues with it. But if you like more cushion in your seat I would still recommend this chair and just suggest purchase some padding to rest on top of it.

    not as good as i thought it was going to be. for a chair this big, it's not that comfortable. it's decent - better than your average cheap $25 office chair from walmart, but its quite stiff and hard. i can also tell it was cheaply assembled, i can see marker traces left behind from where cuts were made for screws, and some sharp staple ends sticking out of the bottom of the chair. not the best quality but decent. its probably only really worth $90, and you could find a better one for the same price or more.

    Bought this chair to replace the home office chair.  For reference, I'm 5'10"" and 195 lbs.  I've owned the chair for approximately 6 months, though by nature of my work, only used it for half of that time.The positives:  It is a good looking chair.  The lumbar support, after a bit of a break in, is quite comfortable - same with the headrest pillow.  The seat cushion is barely padded, but I prefer my chairs to be firm and it's not terrible for sitting (I sit in it for 12 hours a day).  The reclining is a great option and sturdy for my height and weight.Cons:  The gas lift is possibly the cheapest piece of manufacturing I've ever seen.  For the past several months, it has steadily gotten worse and worse, to the point that if you shift even the barest positions in the seat, it loses pressure and sinks you to the floor.  The chrome cylinder is constantly covered in gunk, presumably oil from inside the lift assembly itself.  The manfuacturers ""contact us"" page is useless (Including the typos on the page) - no response to the three or four requests I've sent.  While I find myself rather handy than most, I see no way to remove this cylinder after installation without potentially damaging the rest of the chair, so even if it could be replaced with another, it'd be improbable to return it to it's original state.Final thoughts:  If you're looking for a budget gaming chair for periodic use and don't mind a firm seat, this might satisfy your needs.  Otherwise, spend your money elsewhere.

    I’ve had this chair about a week and it feels/seems pretty sturdy I think it will last a while. The fabric and cushioning are very comfortable, it stays cool sitting in it for a long period. Feels stable too even with it full reclined. Pretty easy to put together, and it’s really nice with or without the pillows.

    I honestly love this chair. I wanted a pink gaming chair for the back support, appearance, and size. I've been working from home since last year and needed a decent computer chair. I really love the design of this one since it isn't the typical ""e-girl"" streamer or the chair with the cat ears in pink. I just wanted something nice that was in pink.I saw a lot of complaints that the chair is firm, but I appreciate that. Every ""executive chair"" I've gotten end up getting too soft and uncomfortable. The support is great if you're going to be sitting in it 8+ hours a day working or gaming.I love that the chair is fabric. I need a lumbar support for computer chairs and the fabric keeps it from sliding. The ability to recline and footrest set this chair miles ahead of any other gaming chairs I looked into.It was very easy to put together and took me less than 30min. The instructions are clear and the package came with all of the parts needed. We will be getting a second chair in a different color for my husbands gaming station. Five stars!

    Long story short this chair is great but simply put, it wasn’t an upgrade from my current chair. My current chair is softer and fits me better especially on the seat.The seat is very long. Imagine sitting all the way back in your sofa. See how your knees touch and kind of lift your feet up? That’s this chair seat.The back support isn’t ergonomical at all. Flat and unwelcoming. The pillows honestly made it worse.It reclines very well and the footrest is DOPE. Unfortunately when I actually got it built and put into my setup, I was like, I’m never going to use that :/It’s a great chair if you don’t already have a great chair. 3.5/5

    I'm going to start off by saying it is a $150ish chair. With that being said I didn't expect the world out of it.Comfort is a 6/10 the cushion is kinda stiff. and the arms are just cloth covered with no padding. Also the levers are a little hard to reach i find myself leaning way over the chair to reach them.Quality is a 5/10 out of the box there where a lot of loose threads, both of the pillows for the back and neck have a sunk in flat spot. And the chair overall just has a kind of cheap feel,and crunching noises.Ease of assemble is a 9/10 it is pretty straight forward and not a lot of parts.I don't really find my self a ""big"" person I am 5'8 and 190lbs. With that being said if I where a couple inches taller, or a bit heavier I would personally go a different route. If you need a budget chair and don't game for hours on end I would say buy! If you have the budget for a $500 secret lab chair or other brand then save the $150 and just put it towards that.
