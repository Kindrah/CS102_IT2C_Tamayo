    Strong  1-ply that gets the job done!  Scott ComfortPlus surprised me with its thick & comfy sheets.  Double rolls lasted forever (great value!)  & septic-safe!  ✅  Perfect for everyday use!

    Safe for septic tank use, soft yet durable to get the job done. Pretty pattern to look good hanging on the holder. The price was super competitive and it gets dropped at my door. Can't ask for more than that!

    This ripply toilet paper is soft and strong. Rolls seem to be not as big as some others, but a relatively good buy.

    Very nice one ply. Not thin.  But rolls are on the small side as not tightly wound.  They are squeezable like the old ad.  Quality is appreciated!  Good job in their choice of tissue to use.

    Scott is a cost effective bathroom tissue. I have had the first roll for over a month and it's still had a quarter of the roll left. It does its job well. It soft and holds all the water. It also dissolves quickly in the toilet. Great cost effective toilet roll.

    It's soft and thicker than most cheap brands I really wasn't expecting that for the money. The rolls are smaller than I expected though. I usually buy mega size for my t.p. holder but, I would buy it again.

    In this day and age, it’s hard to find affordable toiletries that are still great quality. I really like this brand but don’t really buy it in store because of the price so I was glad when I found it on Amazon

    Always buy this toilet paper, but this time had two undersized rolls. You want cheap, Scott’s isn’t the value it was.

    I like SCOTT toilet paper because it typically lasts longer than most other brands. I don't mind it being a bit tougher. I don't use dry paper often. I mostly use wet wipes. But keep dry paper on hand occasionally or for blowing my nose and such.Anyway. This comfort plus goes way too quickly. I tried using less and I still go through it really fast. It feels fluffy like it'll be softer on the sensitive areas, but I found it actually made me more dry and sensitive when I used it.I'll stick to traditional SCOTT toilet paper.

    I never seen the comfort plus brand in my local stores so I decided to try it.  Definitely softer than the original but not as long. You can't go wrong with whatever your preference is, length or softness. I'll see how Iong this pack lasts but glad I was able to try it and I can come back here for more if needed.

    I read a lot of reviews on this product obviously they have never bought the single rolls of Scott comfort plus toilet paper before. Yes there are less sheets per roll than some major brands but it clearly states that in the listing. In my opinion it is definitely worth the price!

For my home, I recently switched to this product, and I couldn't be happier with how well it works. Each pack has 12 double rolls, so it's a good deal for the money. With every use, the robust and absorbent toilet paper offers a pleasant and efficient cleaning experience. I like that it's septic-safe since it gives me comfort in knowing that there won't be any plumbing problems. Because there are sheets on each roll, they last longer between replacements and are a useful option for those with active schedules.One disadvantage that should be noted is that, although being one-ply, some users-especially those with sensitive skin-might prefer a thicker toilet paper for extra comfort and softness. Although this toilet paper works well, some people might not find it to be as fluffy as they would like. Therefore, you might want to think about other options if thickness is more important to you than efficiency. In spite of this, this toilet paper is still a dependable option for regular usage.

    But the fact that dollar tree sells a 4 pack for 1:25 is the reason why I can’t see myself paying double for this again but definitely appreciate the opinion and speed of delivery can’t knock the competition and cost of darn tissue but it is what it is / best cheapest, strongest and  convenient brand I can think of

    The rolls are smaller so you go through them pretty quick but I don't mind because it's soft and the ridges make it work really well.

    I have the Worst Mother in law. For years she complained about our toilet paper being cheap. I told her that it wasn't my fault her son could make enough for us to afford better toilet paper! Last week she drove by our house and threw this out her car window. I waited for her to go out of town and threw into her tree and shrubs. There was enough to really ""decorate"" her house. Everyone thinks I did it & I don't care!

    I didn't pay enough attention about the size of roll, 2ply, and I thought it was the other Scott that I like and lasts forever.  So only respon I gave 4 stars is because I thought and wanted the ones, no ripples, and huge white big Scott rolls, no rippled, on paper,  white and plain Scott's toilet paper!

    This is not the standard length I’m used to with Scott TP. With that said, it is thicker and softer. Not as good a value.

    This is the exact brand that I always buy so when I saw the price I thought it was great. I understand that I missed where  it stated the number of sheets on each roll, but it was also the exact same packaging so it was a little  misleading

    I'd say this Scott Tissue Paper (Comfort Plus) is very reliable in being both soft & comfortable. It's pretty thick and absorbs well which leads to having to use less tissue paper so it lasts awhile. I accidentally got Regular Scott Tissue earlier this month & there was a huge difference. It was only 1 ply where as this is 2 ply so be sure to not make that mistake. I could've got better tissue at the Dollar Store seriously. It almost ruined me from Scott for good bc I was not expecting that from a name brand tissue but then I saw that this one I usually get says comfort plus & it's a fantastic value for the low price. They are definitely keeping up with their competitors. I would recommend this specific type of Scott Tissue paper only. I would never get the regular "" long lasting"" one again!
