    I bought one of these for my grandson who is a high school senior for gaming and a desk chair this past Christmas.  Easy to assemble and sturdy.  Was so impressed, I bought one for myself when my old chair finally broke.  I’m 6’6” tall and around 225 lbs.  I fit in it easily and have no doubt it will last a long time.

    So far, this has been one of the best chairs I’ve owned. I have always had issues finding one that has just the right amount of sturdiness, comfort, and overall performance for a gamer. As someone who weighs around 240 pounds, I struggled finding a chair that has good durability. This one is very firm yet comfortable. I like crossing my legs and sitting in weird positions and this chair has enough room to allow for my weird habits. Most chairs I’ve owned typically last about a year before signs of defects start to show.My only concern is in the photos attached. I was suppose to bolt in the back plate for the back rest but there were no bolt holes? Come to find out there were bolt holes to screw the bolts in but I had to puncture the leather with a knife so I could screw them in where they were suppose to go. This by itself was really weird to me as I wasn’t sure if the intentional design from factory or not? If so, this is pretty inconvenient cause I wasn’t sure if that was what I was suppose to do and no where in the instructions did it talk about this.So far this one seems to be built well and made to last. I definitely recommend this chair for daily gaming use.

    So I work from home and needed a chair that was comfy and would hold up.  I'm 6'1"" and 250 lbs so I wanted a chair that was not at ""max weight"" when I used it.  I looked at a lot of chairs at various prices and decided this was my last shot at a chair under $200.Package came 4 days early and was well packaged. Instructions were very clear and package came with extra hardware in case you lost a bolt or washer which is nice. The wheels are smooth and of higher quality than other chairs I've used. The plastic parts are very dense and of high build quality. Everything about this chair screams STURDY.  I've only sat in the chair for a few hours but I can honestly say this thing has no wiggle room and seems like it will last.Now to my only con for this chair and the reason I didn't give 5 stars. The cushioning in the chair is really really stiff. I'm hopeful this will change over time but the first hour of me sitting in this chair wasn't the most comfortable. I going to say you need to ""break in"" this chair.TLDR:  Great packaging, easy to assemble (took 20-25 minutes), super sturdy, build quality is amazing, stitching is on point, and looks great.  Cushions are solid but in a stiff way.  Not like memory foam.Think like an overfilled cushion to the point of bursting.  Hoping it breaks in over time.

    It was decently easy to assemble. Part of the instructions for the arms might be a little confusing but overall the construction is intuitive. I read some reviews that the seat might be a bit hard but so far no complaints. I also got a cushion for back support. The chair comes with it's own pillow for back support but that was actually quite tough material, so I just left it off. Overall good sturdy chair.

    Recently got this chair to replace an old unrelated model gaming chair. This chair gives you every bang for your buck, it’s super comfortable, and offers great support. All aspects of the chair check off for an all around great gaming chair. Super happy with it.

    Back support is great! And so is the ability to adjust the angle of how the chair sits and I love the head pillow. Has really helped with my strained neck because my posture would make a goblin cry. However, two things: 1, the footrest isn't awful but definitely not great. The bars holding it feel extremely flimsy and like they could break rather easily if actual pressure is applied. Doesn't seem well balanced beneath the chair. I try to be careful with mine if I do actually use it (I rarely do). And 2, which is arguably of utmost importance when looking for a gaming chair, the butt seat can become insufferably uncomfortable after a while; it could definitely use more padding for those who sit for long hours. ): My butt be aching! I've had mine for a couple months now and quality seems great overall. Just the cheek comfort needs more to it. Highly recommend a squishy pillow or two!

    This chair did not hold up. Purchased this in July and gave to my son in August for his birthday. The arm rests quickly came apart and the foam fell out and just this week the arm completely broke off so I will be disposing of the chair. For the price I would expect it to last more than 4 months. Seat cushion also hard and not comfortable to sit on. Do not recommend!

    I am sitting 7-9 hours a day at a computer so I was looking to upgrade my seat.  Mainly I was focused on something economical with a head rest.  This, for $120 seemed a decent option.  Prior reviews looked okay.  I am a big guy, 6'1"" 270 and it is rated for 350 lbs.  The assembly took 30 minutes.  The product is mostly plastic and I am guessing it will last maybe 6 months with my heavy use so disappointed there.  The headrest does work which is the primary reason for this purchase.  But after half a day I find the seat uncomfortably stiff but maybe over time, I will get used to the difference from my last chair.  It is wider than the chair I replaced.  You get what you pay for I guess.  Maybe spending twice as much would have been advisable for more ergonomic comfort and longevity.  I do not plan to use the leg rest as my desk is not deep enough.  You do not need to install it if you do not want it.

    This is a good chair for the cost.Pros:Well built and easy to assemble.ReclinesLumbar support pillow is greatComfyConsLeg rest is short and I’m only 5’ 8” so if you’re any taller it would be unusableDoesn’t recline quite as far as I would likeHead support pillow is good but the strap is a terrible design. The strap hooks are one up and one down which always causes the strap to come undone because it really doesn’t fit the chair all that well.All in all it’s a good chair but if you came hardcore I would spend a bit more.

    Upon first opening the box and pulling out the parts, I was rather impressed by the weight of the pieces and the quality. My excitement quickly turned around when I started assembling it and realized the holes were not located correctly for the screws to fit in. I ended up also discovering that the screws given to me had already been used or manufactured wrong as the threads were stripped and not usable. Fortunately they provide extra parts to use such as screws but was not enough for all the ones that I had with issues. When building it, it took me about an hour trying to get everything screwed in dealing with the screw holes not located correctly. I ended up having to not put in all the screws that the directions called for because of this. After finishing the installation I was throughly impressed with the build and stability of it however some parts such as the arm rests and the adjustment  levels looked either used or very defective with scratches and dents in them. Overall I feel as though I received a high quality USED chair with the amount of wear on certain pieces and assembly issues. I think this product is good and possibly received a bad apple product but I am not satisfied to my expectations given the amount of money it costed.

    My son likes chair. It’s a nice quality and he likes that he can lay back more. It was one of the easiest to put together. Definitely worth it.

    I have had this chair around a week now and one of the wheels fallen off 5 times. Each wheel assembly pressed fine into its socket, but caster actually has 2 wheels - an inner and outer. At least once a day one of the wheels just falls right off. It presses back in fine, but I know it will continue. This part of the caster is pre-assembled from the factory. Also, the chair is rather stiff. While some may like this type of cushion, I prefer something a bit softer. I know this is preference, but I figure it's worth mentioning. I made sure that all bolts/screws were properly tightened, but this thing pops and creaks worse than any office/gaming chair I have ever owned. I am going to re-tighten all the hardware and hope that helps. My advice? Steer clear and go with something of higher quality. I would return it but trying to haul around and return something of this size and weight will be a nightmare. I have had chairs half this price last nearly 10 years...I'm one week in. I am going to attempt to contact customer support to see if they will send me a new caster and will update how the customer experience goes accordingly.

    I did not personally use this product as it was a birthday gift. Evidently the instructions were clear as my inexperienced 16-year-old grandson was able to put it together all by himself (without any leftover parts, I might add). Lol. It seems to be holding up well under the use of a rambunctious teenage boy.

    I have had this chair for a while now.  It works.  It's not the most comfortable chair I have ever used.  I'm thinking it needs an extra seat cushion.  For the price it's pretty good compared to how much you can spend on high end game chairs.

    Its a good looking chair but there are better options, dont buy this for a kid or someone who doesnt take care of their stuff because the materials dont look very durable. if i had to choose again i would buy the DPS chair from costco, i think that one is just under 200$ and is way more comfortable and made with better materials

    Really wanted to like this chair and tried several different sessions to see if I could make this work.But even with the little lumbar cushion it includes, my lower back just wouldnt have it. Not sure if it's the stiffness or the design of the chair itself. But If you're wanting to use this for extended sessions (work or gaming), just be warned, your back will start complaining. That said, I won't in good conscience recommend this chair for anyone over the age of 18yrs.

    I didn't expect a lot from this chair but it really impressed me for the price. I find that most chairs sell you on their comfort but this one is very easy on your bottom. The support on my back is very good as well (I am 5'9""). Like use armrests a lot and most have left my elbows sore after hour. I don't have that problem with this chair. I've been burned by the claims of other chairs as being ergonomic and comfy  and so far I have found that this chair, out of the other chairs I have purchased (around the same price point) have let me down.  I would recommend this chair  to anyone looking for a very good chair for a really good price.

    I like this chair and was comfortable up until a couple weeks ago. The seat padding has gone away and I'm now sitting on the hard base. I don't want to pull it apart and send it back and I don't have the box. Might have to look into replacing the seat foam to something much better if it can be done.

    Bolts get loose even though ive tightened it as tight as it would go. The cushion is also just not comfortable. I weigh 140 lb had the chair for like a month and I feel im sitting on a rock. The chair looks nice though and it was cheap so you get what you pay for.

    This chair is cute but extremely uncomfortable.  I do not see the seat ever getting comfortable, not even after many wears.  I had a different chair in mind and when I went to click on the chair I wanted, it disappeared.  Either way, uncomfortable.  My son agrees, as he also purchased it for himself.

I think it is very good quality for the price! Considering the other options on amazon are $20-$40 cheaper but with more iffy reviews.  The chair was easy to assemble, arrived quick, and looks/feels great. Only thing im precautious about is the foot rest, feels like it’d be easy to break but shouldn't be a problem for a while. 10/10 recommend👍🏽

    The bolts come loose no matter how much you tighten them.Also, maybe it's just me because this is my first gaming chair, but the seat cushion isn't as comfortable as I had hoped it would be. After a good hour of gaming I start to get uncomfortable. After a few months of using it, the cushion is already going flat and I can feet the bars underneath. There's probably better ones out there.

    The screws holding the base of the chair to the vertical support of the chair creak and loosen every time I move in the chair. If I just slightly lean back on the chair, I hear the screws loosening with a loud clicking sound. Every week or so I have to tighten the screws again. I'm not doing any crazy movements in the chair either, I'm just using it like a chair should be used, yet after just 3 weeks, if I move my body to the side to reposition myself or get more comfortable in the chair, I can hear the springs in the base of the chair clinking. I fear in the next month or so something is gonna fall apart or break in this chair, and if that happens I will request for a refund. I recommend anyone to save up the money to buy a more quality chair.

    6 month update.After 6 months of light use, the foam in the cushion has lost much of its cushion. No longer very supportive. I would not recommend buying this chair. I think it is made of high density foam which doesn’t maintain comfort for very long. It is very sturdy though.This chair is very comfortable. I am 6’ 5” and I was concerned I wouldn’t fit in the chair well but it is great! I am very happy with it. Seems very sturdy as well!
