    Redragon Gaming Mouse Beats Other Gaming Mice To start off with, I think that the Redragon gaming mouse is one of the best mice as of right now. I have owned this mouse for about 3 years and it is just as good as brand new. When looking at the price of this mouse compared to other gaming mice, this is cheaper, durable, longer-lasting, and has most of the features as the other expensive mice have. I would most certainly recommend any interested buyers looking for a gaming mouse to buy this product. First and foremost, I think that the Redragon gaming mouse is one of the best mice as of right now because it’s cheap and affordable. When looking for a desktop gaming mouse, you should always research and look for other products that might be similar, less expensive, and easier to use especially when it comes to gaming mice. One of the popular gaming mice that is competing against the redragon mice in the market as of right now would be the glorious model o. This mouse comes around $100 in the market and functions similarly to the redragon mouse. The redragon mouse comes in around $20 as of now due to inflation as well. There isn’t much of a difference between the two mice besides the shape, size, and price. Paying $80 more isn’t worth it if most of the controls, and key features function the same way. Some of the key features that the glorious model o can do as well as the redragon gaming mouse are drag click, butterfly click, has the same amount of sensitivity, and DPI. The main difference between these two desktop gaming mice is that the glorious model “o” feels much lighter and sturdier. The redragon mouse feels a little bit heavier however, it is a decent size for any beginners or experienced gamers. It also has side palm grips for you to keep your thumb, ring finger, and pinky finger on support giving you the most comfortable experience as well. Some of the features that both mice can do that interested buyers would look forward to is having the mouse double click, drag click, and butterfly click. Furthermore, this mouse is very comfortable and durable for a long period of time. The gaming mouse's texture is matte which makes the gaming experience even better. There are also side buttons to change the RGB color or lighting to whichever settings you’d prefer with 7-8 different color options. All of these features are adjustable just by downloading the app or software if needed. After owning this product for 3 years, I have not felt the need to buy another mouse yet at all because of how well-made it is. However, despite all of the pros mentioned, there are always a few flaws or cons since nothing is perfect. One of the cons I experienced by owning this product would be that when gaming, some of the clicks on the redragon gaming mouse don’t register due to how big it is. Even though it is recommended to have lighter-weight desktop mice when gaming, it makes it harder to click while having some clicks not register. Over the past 3 years of owning this product, I have noticed that there is also a solution to fixing this problem. I have improved my gaming skills and it has made clicking faster and much easier for me. I would most definitely recommend this product to gamers who are at least experienced a little bit and have fast clicking hands to enjoy the full experience.

    Just ordered a second one of this model after owning my first one for a year now. I have a cat that particularly loves destroying my mouse cords. Irony aside, I think it's a jealously thing. My original purchase of this was to be a cheaper replacement for my Razr Naga which costs 4x the price, yet this mouse was barely a step down - only lacking the macro keys but gaining the full RGB lights instead of just the only green that old Razr model had. The RGB on this mouse is pretty good, good enough that I like to keep it on the flowing rainbow setting to match my similar effect on the Red Dragon mechanical macro keyboard that I bought a few months after this mouse because I was impressed with the brand quality.Ergonomically it's great. Perfectly shaped large enough that you won't get hand cramps if using the device for extended periods of time. It handles with enough accuracy for 99.99% of people and only tournament ranking professionals would have reason to complain.My only negative point on this mouse is that multiple buttons are too easy to press on accident. It shouldn't be much of an issue for most people, but the side buttons stick out quite far, and it's very easy to press those back/forward buttons when first moving your hand onto the device. But once you've got a grip on it, that stops being a problem and instead a possible benefit, as those 2 side buttons are very easy to press when you want to. The top buttons that control the RGB and DPI suffer from much the same issue. Very easy to accidentally touch them and change the settings accidently. Yet once you hand is on the device, they're not in the way and you're unlikely to accidentally press either button.Build quality it's solid, and amazing for the price. It's notably not as well built as the $80 Razr mouse that I replaced with it, but the difference is small enough that I'd even consider them to be solidly in the same range of mid-cost device.As a side complaint, I'm annoyed that both of the aforementioned pointing devices, especially the $80 Razr one, do not have detachable and replaceable USB cords. I shouldn't have to buy a new device entirely just because the cord is damaged, yet a majority of mice on the market do not have swappable cords. Red Dragon definitely gets a pass on their purposefully cost-cutting design, but it's much more annoying on a luxury like the Naga.

    Duckie of Truth here,Cheap mouse, looks cool, very colorful, different cursor speeds, feels nice and smooth (just remember to remove the plastic from the bottom pads). Honestly, definitely not high quality hence the 4 stars, but for the price top tier. Hopefully it doesnt break on me though, I'll update this if it does. Day Bought: 3/26That's it.Duckie Out!

    This is a great entry level gaming mouse for those that are new to gaming on pc or for the loved one that just wants a cool looking mouse. It  get the job done. Do keep in mind it is wired and the RGB can not be customized. If you that feature, u may have to fork up more money on a higher end RGB mouse. However, if just want it to look good and perform well, this mouse will complete that job.I myself have gotten a high end mouse but i still use this from time to time on my gaming laptop  whenever i travel. 9/10

    Bought this mouse as a replacement for my G502 HERO mouse that has a damaged dongle.Although a bit smaller than I thought (only by about an inch in diameter, not an issue) It feels great!As someone who has long fingers, it's very hard to find a mouse that fits my hands and has the grip I need to play comfortably, has a very high DPI setting, and very customizable lighting software.The box was a cute case that I use to store my old mouse as a backup.My only nitpick was I with it had a higher DPI cap, but again, not an issue.Very recommended product.

    I've had this mouse for 3 years now. My previous mouse was a Razer Naga Molten that was in desperate need of replacing, I decided to look for something that was more all around and cheaper (since the Naga molten was more of MMO/MOBA centric mouse and it was kinda pricey). It's worked pretty well for the last 3 years I've owned it. Very smooth and responsive mouse, practically glides across the pad and it works very well for gaming & work. The driver software also offers you a lot of settings that you can tweak to your preference.Highly recommend.

    I got this to replace an old, failing mouse. I like the textured scroll wheel and the lights make it easy to see in the dark. It's also durable AF...dropped it repeatedly (not on purpose) and it just keeps going like nothing happened.

    I really love the ergonomics of this mouse. It's exactly what I look for when purchasing. It is comfortable to hold and fits in my hand like a glove. Every button press is exactly where I want it to be. I thought the price is insanely good for such a high quality mouse, surely something must be amiss. And I wasn't wrong...Where this mouse fails to deliver is the polling rate. It claims to have the ability to go up to 1000MHz and even provides the option in its software. But let me assure you, it is not 1000MHz polling rate. I would be surprised if it was even 500MHz. The cursor never feels ""smooth"" no matter how I tuned it via acceleration, speed, Windows settings, etc. On desktop, or games like MOBAs or strategy, it's fine. For first person shooters, it feels like a stuttery mess unless the game provides some form of mouse smoothing.And the reality is, for gaming it is far from the perfect mouse. Maybe it's the lazer, maybe the 1000MHz polling rate is a lie, I don't know. The unfortunate reality is the cursor is not smooth. I own multiple high end gaming mice, where the difference is night and day compared to this mouse. It's unfortunate, I really love how this one feels. But the reality always comes through that you get what you pay for.My conclusion is it's not a bad mouse, unless you really need precision. Then it's a really bad mouse.

My experience with the Redragon M602 White has been quite a journey. There are certainly areas where it excels, but it does have its pitfalls.To start, the software and driver support for the M602 White is a nightmare. The mouse doesn't have dedicated software, and despite my efforts to navigate Redragon's unorganized website for a compatible program, I came up empty-handed. Interestingly, this product isn't even listed on their Global site but is available on their American site. It's a rather perplexing situation. The mouse shows up as a ""HID-Compliant Mouse"" in Windows 11. When attempt to use software made by RedDragon to connect to the mouse for button remapping and RGB control you are told ""Gaming mouse disconnected"" when it's clearly not. There is no software or driver for this mouse. It's purely a plug and play device. It's not even recognized as anything more or less then a generic mouse on Windows 11.I strongly advise against trying to install software not specifically designed for this mouse model. I tried to do just this for writing this product review. My attempt at installing M602-RGB software resulted in a catastrophic lockout of my mouse clicking capabilities on my Windows 11 machine. I had to fix the issue by navigating using only the keyboard and TAB key to uninstall the software. It was a nerve-wracking ordeal. Without any RedDragon software installed, the M602 White, along with my other computer mice, work fine.The M602 is equipped with on-board controls for adjusting the RGB lighting and DPI settings, located beneath the scroll wheel. The color modes and DPI are controlled via a series of button presses. Understanding the interplay between DPI changes and color cues was tricky at first, but the product manual clarified this. Cycling through the color modes leads to my favorite - the rainbow setting.For its price point, the M602 is a decent investment if you're seeking a cheap, stylish, RGB-enabled mouse. I almost returned it but decided to keep it for its aesthetics. While I would have preferred a black model with a higher DPI range, the existing DPI level of the M602 works fine for my non-competitive gaming needs.The RGB elements are a major plus for me, especially the bright colors and smooth transitions of the rainbow setting. I even wrapped the long connecting cable in a gold plastic wrap to enhance its aesthetics. Despite being one of Redragon's cheaper models, the quality holds up. The durable plastic container that comes with the mouse has been also been repurposed for other uses thanks to some added magnets.I am pleased with the M602 White, and I would consider buying a higher-end model from Redragon again when I need a new computer mouse. RedDragon may not produce flawless products, but the quality is solid for the price. I would recommend the M602 White, but with the clear warning about its software issues.

    This was originally a really good mouse. With wear and tear, it's gets a lot less nice. The circular dragon on the palm completely wore through. Also, the fact that it's white, if you don't wash your hands before every time you use your computer, there's going to be a lot of gunk that builds up on the different buttons, so make sure you wash your hands or be prepared to have to clean this mouse about once a month with a fine tool to keep it clean. Also, if you have a desk with a sharp edge to it, chances are the chord will fray as well like mine did. I don't know why they make the cord with a breakable material, better off with a typical rubber like coating.

    Reviews on this M602 webpage are quite similar to those of lots of other Redragon mice listed by Amazon. Not all these reviews have been assigned to the correct mouse sibling, however, because of bewilderment created by their abundance and similarities among many siblings in an enormous litter. Confusion about which mouse is which is apparent even on the multiple websites Redragon itself publishes all over the world. At any rate, most reviewers agree that the company produces good mice, and that its process for obtaining the specific driver software you need for tinkering with them sucks.Thus my comments may apply to many Redragon mice, but my experience involves only the M602 Griffin. He is a cute little critter with a lot of gee-whizzy multicolored lights, which you can make perform tricks such as altering his “breathing” depth and rate. (If you set them too low I wonder if he becomes erratic from hypoxia, and then do all his lights turn blue?) He has a magnificent, truly elegant, long red and black braided tail that looks like it should belong to a mouse perched much nearer the top of the pecking (gnawing?) order. At a remarkably low price he meets my need for a precise mouse to set various instrument knobs and gauges in the glass panel instruments of my flight simulator very well. The rest of this long tale …involves his software.His box contained only my mouse himself, a Redragon decal and a useless 40-page set of “Operating Instructions” in 35 or so languages. Under “Software Instructions” it says “Users can adjust … settings through the software after downloading and installing it.” But there are no clues about where find that software. Be prepared for frustration when you begin an internet search. Mine led me down several blind alleys at places like redragonzone.com, redragon-global.com and redragon.store. Early in my journey through this maze, at redragonusa.com I spotted an M602. Its picture looked identical to my mouse and there was a link to download its driver. “That’s too easy,” I mumbled, and I was right. The link led to a file called MNEMEANLION.zip. Which proved to be a nearly complete dud. It did unzip and load into my computer, but here was no shortcut to open a GUI, and each of its three executable files did nothing useful. At least they did no harm.Further along my torturous route through the maze I discovered lurking there a total of 50 different Redragon mice and about 30 drivers. After eventually overcoming this diabolical plot to hide software on the internet I tracked down the correct M602 Griffin programming utility, at (drumroll please) redragonshop.com/pages/software. Its compressed driver file is named “m602.rar” (see screenshot of its GUI). It works, and unless it contains some undetectable malware planted there by the Chinese MSS it also does no harm. But as noted by other reviewers, moving its various sliders yields only very minor changes in some of Griffin’s behaviors.Bottom line: my rating of 4 stars would have been a lot lower had I not felt challenged by reading many previous reviews that talk about software problems but fail to reveal their solutions. I’m still euphoric from my detective work. But I sure wish that Mr. and Mrs. Redragon, who must be exempt from China’s one-litter policy, would learn about birth control, or would provide less intrepid customers with a roadmap of their maze.

    Look, I know gamers like to brag about how much all their equipment costs, but for those of us who'd rather spend the money on the actual games instead of a million dollar mouse, you won't find better than this. It's smooth and extremely comfortable. Plus it comes in a really cool case AND the dragon emblem on the mouse itself lights up. Worth every penny.

    1. Affordable Price: One of the standout features of the Redragon M602 is its budget-friendly price. It's an excellent choice for gamers on a tight budget or those looking for a secondary gaming mouse.2. RGB Lighting: The RGB lighting on this mouse is a nice touch, especially considering its price. You can customize the lighting effects through Redragon's software, adding a bit of flair to your setup.3. Comfortable Design: The ergonomic design of the mouse makes it comfortable to hold for extended gaming sessions. The textured side grips provide a secure and comfortable grip, and the mouse fits well in the hand.4. Customizable Buttons: With 7 programmable buttons, you have the flexibility to set up macros and shortcuts to enhance your gaming experience. This is a nice feature to have, especially at this price point.Cons:1. Build Quality: The build quality of the Redragon M602 leaves something to be desired. It feels a bit plasticky and less durable compared to higher-end gaming mice. Over time, this may affect its longevity.2. Sensor and Accuracy: The mouse uses an Avago sensor, which is decent but not as precise as some of the sensors found in more expensive gaming mice. This can lead to issues with accuracy, especially in fast-paced games.3. Software: While the mouse does come with customization software, it's not the most user-friendly. Setting up macros and adjusting DPI settings can be a bit cumbersome, and the software lacks some of the features offered by other gaming mouse software.4. Cable Quality: The cable is not as flexible as some other gaming mice, which can lead to drag and affect your movement during gaming.5. Weight: The Redragon M602 is on the heavier side, which might not be suitable for gamers who prefer lightweight mice for faster and more precise movements.Conclusion:The Redragon M602 RGB Wired Gaming Mouse is a budget-friendly option that offers some decent features for its price. It's comfortable to hold, has customizable RGB lighting, and programmable buttons. However, it falls short in terms of build quality, sensor precision, and software usability. If you're on a tight budget and need a gaming mouse for casual gaming, the Redragon M602 can get the job done. However, if you're a serious gamer looking for top-notch performance and build quality, you might want to consider investing a bit more in a higher-end gaming mouse.

    If you're looking for a cool-looking mouse with basic RBG features at a low price, consider this one. It would work best with a red theme in my opinion (simply because the cord is red) but I have mine tuned to a nice icy blue just to light up my PC dungeon when the lamp is off.By searching up their software, you can map basic macros to it (I set mine to automatically do a ""grapple"" move in The Force Unleashed II) and it has a total of 6 clickable buttons in addition to the wheel. If you don't care about that, you can disable the buttons, switch them around, or map them to common actions like copy, paste, stop/play, go back, open ""run"", etc.You can also adjust the rate at which the pointer moves across the screen using the DPI menu in the software. By default, the mouse has one of the middle buttons mapped to cycling through various preset DPI settings, and will have the other middle button mapped to cycling through RGB presets. Of course, both of these can be disabled or changed.There's a lot of subjectivity in this point, but I find it pretty comfortable. The top of the mouse might be a bit too wide for smaller hands.All in all, it's nothing special, but it's great bang for the buck and perfect for a budget gaming PC build.

    My son has gone through a few different PC Mice before landing on this one.  This is his second version of this particular Mouse, which is gloss white.  His first one was matt black.  There is a notable differenc in feel between glossy and matt.  Cleaning is also a bit easier with gloss, but some people may like the feel of the rubbery matt texture.  He likes it for speed and clicks and it fits comfortably in his middle-schooler hand.  We like the Red Dragon products for their price and performance.  As with many PC products, there are so many as to boggle the mind.  I do recommend this brand and product though.

    07Mar2023 update:Well, as I've found online, for all - the mouse works. However the web site has two variations ...USA ...zone and while one may get a single page to load I cannot navigate the site - getting error 500 which is a significant error, not a broken page, URL, etc.There is a wireless version that comes up as well (didn't want wireless, just saying) - same experience.So, per my experience, for it's price point - forget the ""programable"" buttons. I don't see any ""driver"" or ""App"" that would then load and change the operation of the mouse (again, I'd love to disable the two FWD/BAK buttons for being poorly placed for ""me""). I'll learn to keep my thumb away - I hope. Also, the DPI steps to the max, will be what they are. I hoped for possibly a different range to a different, ""lower"" maximum.So again, it's a fine mouse for this price point. Nevertheless since not as advertised, went from 4 Stars to 3. I rarely give a 5 Star review since as many ""here"" may do - keep that for amazing value, experience, product maximum-ness.Again, I hope that helps someone in a meaningful way.--- original review upon receipt is below ---So far, it's not bad. I need an accurate mouse, stable and with reasonable adjustable pointer movement.For me, it jumps, steps up to the 7200 DPI to quickly, which for me would be less accurate work. One step below prior to that DPI would fit me very well. The DPI just below it works, and I can adjust my hand in time.It speaks of software to ""program"" it - the only place is on the outside lable for a URL. I fully realize I can search for one too, nevertheless would prefer a, ""as purchased customer recognised URL for that"" - if could matter once there I will see.For me, the FWD/BAK side buttons I'd like to disable if can. Occassionally my thumb hits it and I find myself magically elsewhere - realised what happened just hit the other button. Again, I don't want or need them ""now"" and hope I can disable them if ""programable"" to do nothing.Otherwise, and for the price at this time - I'd recommend this to anyone wanting, needing a mouse that ""appears"" may last. There was a time, they just did - last. My last mouse lasted 6 mo's - first time in my lifetime of computing. The wireless are just not a good fit since use it so much and aggrevating with the batteries so need a Wired Mouse.If it winds up lasting and at this price, well then, - wonderful :) and thank you.I hope that helps someone in some meaningful way, - even spreadsheet office workers - not gamers.

    [UPDATE]I just bought another one of these.  Since I bought the last one, I also bought a Logitech, a Corsair, and a Razer.  I like the Logitech a bit more but it was several times the price and it lives on my gaming desk because I don't want to damage it.  This mouse is better than the Corsair or the Razor, and it's cheap enough to toss in a backpack without much concern about breaking it.  Once again I had to do physical mods to get rid of the pointless lightshow; no idea why they keep spending more money to make their product worse by including this 'feature'.  I took pictures this time.Here is the process:1.) Press on the mouse feet with your fingers until you find where the screw holes are.2.) Poke through with an xacto knife, trim away around the screws so that there is a nice chamfer on the remaining material (you don't want bits that will get stuck on stuff while in use) (see picture).3.) Remove the 4 screws.4.) Pry up the mouse by the white area on the back side.5.) Unplug the wire going to the top half of the mouse.6.) Pull up the right side of the mouse to remove it.7.) Unscrew and unplug the board attached to the wheel...it can be tossed.8.) Clip the legs of the 4-lead LED and toss it as well.9.) Using a side cutter or small pliers, crush the led's (circled in image) until there is nothing left but the traces below.  Shake the little bits into the trash; you don't want them rattling around in the mouse.10.) Plug the top half of the mouse back in and reattach with the 4 screws.11.) (optional) - You can buy mouse foot material that can be cut to various shapes, or that comes in generic shapes.  This can be used to replace the mouse feet that you have to cut to get to the screws, but I find that just doing a quality cut leaves the old feet perfectly functional.I know that's not the 'correct' way to remove LED's, but it is the easiest given the way this mouse is assembled, and I don't intend to reuse them anyway.[/UPDATE]The mouse is great.  It fits my large hand well.  Tracks well even on a cheap plastic table.  Clicks all work perfectly, including the wheel.  The software is terrible; if you play around with it long enough you can get the mouse to stop flashing at you but it never sticks.  I ended up opening the mouse and just removing all the flashing LED's...THERE WERE A LOT OF THEM!  This was a large improvement as even in direct sunlight the LED's are too bright and flashy, and in the dark they were far brighter than my screen.  Note to seller: save some money and skip the LED's...you will have a better product and people won't have to do surgery and replace mouse feet to make your product acceptable.

    I purchased this mouse in January of 2020. I used it nearly every day since then and I really like it and the way that you can adjust the speed of the mouse movement. I also like the colors and the feel of the mouse on a mouse pad .Went to use it this morning and the top part of the mouse is dead although the red underneath ( used to be called a trackball when it had moving parts ) is still lit. Swapped it out for another mouse and the other mouse works fine .No surprises, though.  I am ordering another one. ( Oh I forgot to mention, I also bought one of these for work and replaced the one the company provided.)

    I really wanted to like this mouse because it is hard to find a quality mouse with proper support rests for your ring and pinky fingers.Unfortunately, while this mouse is advertised as being optical, it is not.  It is a laser mouse.  For a household with small children who like to do things such as stare at a laser up close, this is a total deal-breaker - and false advertising.Likely related to it being a laser mouse instead of optical, the lift-off distance was atrocious.  Even while trying to navigate to the Amazon return page using that mouse I almost couldn't do it because of how it kept tracking even when I lifted the mouse the full comfortable distance from my mouse pad resulting in the mouse cursor moving back and forth on the screen instead of going one direction like I intended, and like my other mice have no problem doing (however those other mice do not have proper ring and pinky rests, hence looking for a properly designed ergonomic mouse.As for the ergonomics, I imagine they are great for someone with fingers about 1-1.5 cm shorter than my own.  If I fit my hand comfortably on the mouse while holding it in the air, my ring and pinky fingers hang over the edge by over 1 cm.  If the mouse is on the mouse pad, those same fingers drag and are forced to be bent in an uncomfortable position essentially negating the otherwise nice ergonomics built into the mouse for those fingers.Another gripe is the mouse feet, or gliders, have a lot of friction and are sticky.  Both of my other mice glide fine over my mousepad, but this mouse had significant resistance that was immediately noticeable.Had to return this mouse immediately which is too bad because it looks like a great mouse, and with a few adjustments, could be so.

    The way this mouse fits an adult sized hand is crazy. They definitely put in a lot of time designing it. If you are a gamer or on the computer a lot this is the mouse for you. It's not wireless but with the lights it's a good thing so you don't have to go through all those batteries.

    I have been using this mouse since May 2018 as my daily and I thought it did the job very well until I noticed a pattern. I am currently on my second mouse whose left click either doesn't register or registers twice with one click. The same problem happened with my first mouse after ~2 years of use except it was the scroll wheel button. I didn't think of it much when I ordered a new one in 2021. It almost feels like they made this mouse so it'll last you only 2 years and then u gotta buy again. I reached out to customer support and they said they can't do anything about it.Ergonomics: For my decent sized hand, it does the job very well except there's a big distance between your middle finger resting on the right click and your ring finger resting on the side. I never got used to this despite dailying it for 5 years.I will say it has been extremely durable. I take very good care of my electronics and keep them clean and shiny.I love the RGB except there's always one tiny area in front of the forward side button where the light bulb can hit your eyes directly if you're sitting in a particular direction.I honestly used it for so long because I was ok with compromising given the affordability. However, after noticing the pattern with buttons not working after every ~2ish years of use, I might go for a different better brand.

    Great overall, Nice and fancy, Great grip. Nothing to be complaining about except for one thing. The cable is very stiff and it gets stuck alot between wall and table in hot heated gaming sessions. But with time it will surely get better.

    After purchasing this product I am very pleased with how this mouse can do anything you want with it.Pros:-Very comfortable with your hand especially the way they've designed it.-RGB options are fantastic, I like how you can make any color in any way you like it!-mouse sensitivity buttons are an actual nice feature, the way how you want to adjust is literally close to the mouse wheel.-I like how there are extra buttons on the mouse, since this is a gaming mouse it is quite useful especially when you are playing games such as; Overwatch, call of duty, fallout, and etc.Cons:-Mouse sensor sensitivity; when I am trying to adjust my hand position with the mouse usually I'm so used to adjusting it almost one inch off the service but with this mouse, it's still recognising me using it even if it's almost an inch off the service. I looked to see if I can change this from the software where I installed it from and it doesn't seem like there's any way of changing it sadly.-Installing the software and restarting the pc; After installing the software of this mouse I open the application to change the color but nothing happened it still did the same default rainbow color changing on the mouse instead of changing anything but I did try the restart pc method and it worked surprisingly. I find it a bit ridiculous that I had to restart my entire pc just to make the mouse work but I can understand why at the same time.-Mouse wheel position; when I use my middle finger to use the mouse wheel it feels a bit awkward when scrolling through my browser or playing games when selecting weapons or items, this is another minor issue but I can also overlook as well.---------------------So far that's is all I have my thoughts on this product, I highly recommend anyone buying this kind of product, and yes even with the cons I mentioned beforehand but still, I think everyone should buy this product!~B

    (DISCLAIMER: I WAS NOT PAID OR ENCOURAGED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW | THESE ARE MY TRUE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ABOUT THIS BRAND AND PRODUCT!!!)If you're buying as new PC gamer, or as long term gamer just wanting some fresh gear, know that REDRAGON is as good as Logitech, Corsair, Steel Series, Razer, ETC.Do not hesitate to buy from them!All of there products have great build quality, engaging and satisfying clicks and tactile bumps, pure RGB with an assortment of mesmerizing settings, and highly customizable universal hardware!Personally, I have owned this mouse, the GRIFFIN M602 and and YAMA K550 with a hardtop RGB mousepad all by REDGRAGON, for about 2 years now. While I personally have used and tried an assortment of every other gaming brand! REDRAGON IS AMONG THE GREATS!AS GREAT AS THE DAY I GOT IT!!!All the products have been proved to have the longevity of a high tier gaming brand!!!Clicks and Bumps and everything all still strong and working as good as ever.This mouse has by far the best click I have ever felt.Logitech is known for it's clicks and simple designs (in my opinion and some around me).And this click blows the doors off of every mouse I've touched!!!Ergonomically and wonderful design shape, but slightly heavy, BUT! that is the tier of mouse this is! This there larger ergonomic design! They do have other shapes and sizes! Don't forget about their weighted mice!REDRAGON hit the nail on the head flawlessly as a brand.The product execution is over the top perfect!!!From them being completely accessible through Amazon (my favorite shopping platform!) and to the names of the products the spots in the market there products fit in the style, the dragon logo and name, the packaging, the software, and everything about the brand and their products!!!They really know what they're doing in the gaming world TRUST them!They are not over the top by any means!A truly streamlined and brilliantly marketed brand and product(s)!They are the quiet cool step cousin that people are scared to talk to because he looks so bad ass but theyre told hes a piece of shit, and then they find out hes just as good a person as everyone else and way better than you may have thought.Great gaming feel and as well as high quality competitive tier build.REDRAGON is a very well thought out brand.

    I was initially very skeptical of this mouse given the price and what I'd heard about red dragon's software. However, upon opening the package, for a 20$ mouse I was amazed at the weight and the quality. It was well beyond what I had expected. I knew going into purchasing a mouse that I didn't need anything fancy. I'm a graphic designer who does the very rare but occasional gaming, and I didn't want to spend a ton on a mouse. I just wanted something wired, and white to match my PC case. I'm very pleased with using it thus far. There's customizable software for color and sensitivity available by search on red dragons website and the buttons on the side are not too in the way (a fear I had about bumping them during regular use) and the grip is comfortable. Also, the plastic feels much less cheap than I expected it to. I couldn't guess it was a $20 dollar mouse if I didn't buy it myself. Definitely recommend this mouse, as it's a great budget option and holds it's own.

    First off, wireless mice can kick rocks.  I don't wanna have to dock or replace batteries constantly.  That already puts this mouse at an advantage.I was pleasantly surprised when this came in the mail.  I've had Razer, Corsair, and Logitech mice in the past.  They were great until they started to conk out.  Razer is particularly bad in this aspect: quality control, value for price, and durability leave a lot to be desired.  This mouse is holding up very well so far.Instead of coming in a lazy cardboard box, you get a reusable plastic case.  Certainly not expected at the price point.The RGB pattern is beautiful and mesmerizing.  The feel of the mouse is nice.  Parts don't feel particularly premium but the usual cheap clickyness isn't there, either.  You definitely get more than you pay for.This mouse is great if you're tired of paying too much for mice that slowly die on you over time.  No, it's good period.  Really, the only bad thing I can think of is a lack of tuning software (that I know of at least).  It doesn't have good hardware acceleration but it is responsive so who cares.But let me not oversell this.  I recommend it as a solid backup option or if you simply want to complete an RGB setup.  Now, if you are hard-core competitive on MMO's or shooters, you may want to look elsewhere but, otherwise, this mouse will serve you well and justify the price.

    The mouse is generally good, but the sensitivity/color controls are strange. The top button changes both, while the bottom button just changes sensitivity. I don't want the lights in the first place, it's annoying to set them to off.

    Overall: 8/10It’s a great mouse for the price, it’s obviously an entry level gaming mouse but even if my setup was high end then I would still use this mouse because it can easily do what other more expensive gaming mice can do and I think that’s pretty much all that matters. For esports I would certainly get a better mouse but for casual gaming/productivity uses than this mouse works perfectly fine for me.Pros:•Pretty good mouse for the price, I spent a total of $15.99!•Decently weighted, didn’t feel like cheap plastic, I was surprised by how heavy it felt my first time handling it.•Colors and patterns are smooth and mesmerizing, my personal favorite is the wave as the colors seamlessly flow together.•Braided wire so it’s built to last tugs and strain.•My hand is able to comfortable grasp the mouse due to its unique shape, but everyone’s result may vary. Personally my hand is pretty small but it still fit the mouse nicely.Cons:•The software for the mouse was a bit tricky to configure. I had to download the software manually from the website and had trouble getting my presets to save/work but I figured it out after a few minutes (Run the program as admin and it should work fine!)•It’s not a dealbreaker but some spaces on the side of the mouse can cause light to shine out directly at me sometimes but it’s very very mild, shouldn’t bother you unless you’re really picky about that sort of thing.•Bit troublesome to find the right balance of DPI sometimes when using the preset button, it’s either too sensitive or too slow but that can be easily reconfigured in the downloadable software.Edit: 9/23/20Ended up returning the mouse due to the finger rests limiting me from easily picking up the mouse to move around. This was a mistake on my part since I have limited desk space so I opted to return this mouse for one without the extended finger rests on the sides. My statement still stands that this mouse is great for the price, just make sure you have enough mouse space to move around 😅

    I'm thoroughly impressed with the Redragon M620 Wired Gaming Mouse. I've had it for a bit now and I've had no issues with it. It's fast, accurate, and extremely responsive.The build quality is fantastic. It's sturdy in the hand the only thing that you might find odd is the shape of the mouse but it's easy to get used to once you start using it.The customization options are great for people who want to tailor the mouse to their specific needs. The software that you have to download once you purchase it allows you to customize the buttons, DPI settings, and RGB Lighting.Overall, I'd highly recommend this gaming mouse to anyone looking for a mouse that's reliable and performance-oriented. The price is also a bargain.

    I bought the white color and it came perfectly! My partner and I only use Reddragon mouses (probably for 5+ yrs now) so we always come back if we need another one. The only reason why I bought a new one is because the scroll wheel on my old one (the black Reddragon centrophorus) was wearing off and required a lot of additional force to make the scroll wheel register on the computer. I hope they fixed this problem with the Reddragon Griffin because these mouses do last a long time. I bought my black Reddragon Centrophorus 3 years ago for reference.Differences between Centrophorus and Griffin- Material: Cent. Has a rough texture similar to gravel which helps with my grip. Griffin is a smooth white plastic all around with raised white prints on the side assuming to aid in grip as well.- Size: As shown in my pictures Cent. is smaller, it fitted in my hand nicely enough to where I could hold the whole mouse and have my wrist on the table at the same time (you shouldn’t do this for a long time tho cuz it can strain your tendons!!). Griffin is wider and longer than Cent. I don’t have a preference, just wanted to point it out.- Color way: Cent. was usually offered in black/red with a matching cable and only red LEDs. Griffin is white w/ a black cable and rotating red/orange/pink/green/blue/purple LEDs that with settings to change the patterns on the mouse buttons itself.- Price: Cent. Was $13-15 when I bought it 3 yrs ago which was a bang for my buck as a broke college student. With the down side of the deteriorating mouse wheel which is the bane of its retirement for my setup... Griffin is pretty much double the price at $24 but I believe it’s worth it, if the scroll wheel lasts forever that is.TLDR: Griffin is neat, the effects are cool, large size could fit any hand comfortably.
