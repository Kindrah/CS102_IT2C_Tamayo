    I had way too many cords and plugs on the side of my bed so I had been looking for a charging option for all of my Apple products. This charger was on a flash deal so I lucked out on getting it on sale! It is a perfect nightstand addition. It’s sleek and compact and does what it says: charges my phone, watch and AirPods all at the same time. No issues or problems from me. It even charges my phone with its case on! I do have to make sure it is firmly pressed on the charger for it charge more quickly, only thing to note. Other than that, perfect purchase!

    My old wireless charger died so I was looking for a new one. This charger had the benefit of also charging my Apple Watch at the same time. It works flawlessly and connects instantly unlike my old charger. The only downside to this charger is that it won't charge if the phone is laid horizontally (the charging point is too high) and thus can't use the nightstand mode on the phone. But it's not a hindrance since I knew that when I chose this charger. I am quite pleased with the value and performance of this charger.

    I got this charge for a cruise so I didn’t have use so many ports and take so many cords. I still use at home and it’s so easy to just set my phone and watch down and it starts charging.I will say there are some things that might not be ideal for some people. One is that you can’t charge your phone horizontally.Another thing I noticed is that if you have a case on your AirPods, you can’t charge it on. You have to take them out.Other than that, this is a great charger, it’s portable and great for the price.

This charging stand doesn’t get 5 stars because of the  physical charge port on the back. That plug is meant for apple products/airpods. I personally have beats which is apart of Apple but for whatever reason they use a different usb charge cord. Outside of that, I love how compact this stand is only taking up a couple inches, no wider than a coffee mug. My watch hangs directly & securely on the back charging & my phone charges effectively but its certainly not a fast charger..I’m also a person who loves to sleep in complete darkness so I adore the fact that the blue light that indicates it’s charging doesn’t stay on the entire time.

    I recently purchased the 3-in-1 charging station for my iPhone SE 3rd Gen, and I must say, it has surpassed all my expectations! This sleek and modern charging station has become the ultimate power hub for all my devices.Firstly, the convenience factor is through the roof. With dedicated spots for my iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods, I can charge all my essentials overnight or when I'm working at my desk without the clutter of multiple cables. The wireless charger for the iPhone is super responsive, even with a case on, and it begins charging the moment I place my phone on the stand.The design is another aspect where this charging station truly shines. Its footprint is minimal, which means it doesn't hog space on my nightstand. The black finish is elegant and complements my tech gadgets perfectly, adding a touch of sophistication to my setup.The build quality feels premium and sturdy. The charging station has a solid base that ensures stability, so I don't have to worry about my iPhone or Apple Watch tipping over. Plus, the vertical design allows for easy viewing of my phone and watch, which is great for checking notifications or the time at a glance.Charging efficiency is on point as well. My  iPhone SE 3rd Gen charges quickly, and the stand even supports my AirPods Pro with the wireless charging case. The LED indicators are subtle and not too bright, so they don't disturb my sleep at night.

    Purchased this item for my wife who just recently decided to turn in her Fitbit for an iWatch.  She has an iPhone 14, an iWatch, and a pair of AirPods 2(with lightning connector).  This charging stand works well and has the smallest footprint to charge all three at the same time.  Her iPhone is in a MagSafe phone case and begins to charge immediately upon placing it on the charger.  Her iWatch fits easily on the watch charger and does not slip off as it lays horizontally and to top it off, the the AirPods plug into the lightning plug on the back of the charger stand.  I knew she would be happy with this purchase as I have been using this same charger for my iPhone, iWatch and AirPods with excellent results for close to a year.  I use two of them one for home and one that I carry in my travel bag.

    Bought this to replace my old wireless charger, just got a watch. Very convenient and well made. The balance is good, haven’t knocked it over yet, but I’m sure I’ll manage.  Consistent charging, great product for the price point.

    We purchased one of these chargers for our son, who has an iPhone, Apple Watch, and Air pods. He needed more charging ability in his room, without a ton of cords. So this was perfect! In fact it was so perfect, we bought 3 more. Its super sleek design adds to our nightstand aesthetic, instead of detracting from it. We leave our phones, AirPods and watches on them overnight and it charges great! However, It does charge a little slower with three devices on it at once. But for us that hasn’t been a problem. It doesn’t take up a lot of room, so it works for many different places (nightstand, kitchen counter and desk). We are extremely happy with our chargers.

    I purchased this 3 in 1 charging station with some apprehension.  But once I started using it I have become a believer.  It's a high quality sturdy product, with a fantastic design.  It works really well to charge all three devices (iPhone, iWatch and Airpods).  Allows you to avoid multiple wires on the side table, takes minimal space and works really well.

    I really like the design of this charging station. It has a very minimal footprint, which is what I was really hoping for. I got a lightning to USB-C adapter for the earbud charging portion, since I don’t use AirPods. My earbud case stores conveniently between that adapter and the back of the phone easel when not charging. My Apple Watch charges just as well as it did on the OEM cable, but it seems like the charging for my phone is slower than other wireless chargers I’ve used. I suspect this is because the charging coil is not optimally positioned for my smaller phone (13 mini). I would love to see this same design with MagSafe charging so that each phone model would be able to line up optimally with the charging coil and also be able to charge while in landscape orientation (as is, it doesn’t charge at all when in landscape orientation).

    Use to have a power strip next to by bed with three cords and it drove me nuts looking at it all the time. Saw this and had to get it. I’ve had it for a few months now and i love it. I can charge all of my devices with only one outlet taken up and don’t need that ugly power strip anymore. I will say it isn’t the fastest charger but i go to bed around 1-2am and wake up at 8-9am and my phone, watch and airpods will all be at 100%. The only thing is i wish i was able to charge my phone horizontally to utilize the standby mode but it’s not a deal breaker i still love it. I even took it to Chicago with me and it fit in my suit case just fine!

    The iPhone Charger Station has transformed my charging experience entirely. Its lightning-fast charging speed is unparalleled, ensuring my device is always ready to go when I need it. With a sleek design and compact size, it seamlessly fits into any space, whether at home or on the go. I no longer worry about tangled cords or unreliable connections, thanks to its sturdy build and secure grip. Plus, its versatility allows for effortless charging anywhere I need it. From its reliable performance to its convenience and durability, this charger station has exceeded all my expectations. For anyone seeking a top-notch charging solution for their iPhone, I can't recommend it highly enough.

    I use this product strictly for my watch currently, only because my phone doesn’t get a full charge while using it and sometimes overheat (could be because of my outdated phone too lol) & I also don’t have AirPods yet, so I can’t speak for that charge quality. BUT I bought this charger for its design and I use it everyday for my apple watch. It does charge my watch pretty quick btw.Update: Recently bought 2nd Gen Airpods and they charged! So AirPods and watch charge great, but I’m Still having the same issue with my phone getting hot and barely charging while using this but it could just be my outdated phone!I still recommend purchasing.

    I wondered if the 3-in-1 Charging Dock for iPhone, Wireless Charger for iPhone, and iWatch would work because I have such a small space to place it on (RV living?...enough said). I was so glad the space required was precisely what I had. The phone has to be set just right on the charger, which isn't hard to do, and the iWatch hangs solidly on its perch. The blue light lets me know that everything is placed the way it should be and charged for the day.  I highly recommend it.

    I bought this charger 9 months ago and have loved it. After months of daily use, it’s begun to stop charging my phone. At first I was mad and began looking for another brand, but realized this charger has better reviews and worked well for me, and it’s only $19! Will purchase again!

    I love this all in one charger and it has a small footprint.  BUT....if you don't seat your phone just right, there is an annoying blue blinking light that lights up your bedroom.  Also, the light stays on even when seated.  i wish there was an option to turn it off.  have to cover it with tape in order to not have it brighten my room.  Other than that, it is nice to have all my electronics on one stand.

    First!  Great charging station.  Everything works as described.  But what was really impressive was the customer support I received when the package arrived damaged and was empty.  I called Amazon immediately and explained the charger was delivered but due to shipping it had been lost.  Not a problem they replaced with no charge and had a replacement in two days!!  Thank You & get this charging station you won't be disappointed.

    I use this charger (I bought 2 - nightstand and office desk) with an iPhone 15 Pro Max in an Otter Defender series case and it always makes a charging connection on the first attempt. I also use it to charge my AirPod Pros and it works flawlessly to charge both.What I have found most valuable though is that it has changed the way I use my phone because the phone is now in an upright, sturdy position for me to operate without grasping it. Its a subtle difference, but I find I prefer operating the phone without holding it, resulting in me using Siri more (go figure). I'm just reporting what has happened, not trying to explain why. I am thoroughly please with these chargers, so much so that I was compelled to purchase a second one.

    I got tired of having all 7000 cords on my nightstand so I decided to get this product to see what I could do to reduce clutter on my nightstand. Let me tell you how amazing this product is, I put my phone up there to charge at night which is the iPhone 14 Pro Max not only is it fully charged by the time I wake up but so are my AirPods and my Apple Watch!!! the product is perfect size very compact in charges fast!!! I accidentally knocked this. Stand off of my nightstand and no damage whatsoever. Just put it back up like nothing never happened very well built and sturdy. Definitely recommend this product!!!

    This charging stand is the absolute best!It is neat looking, even when charging all...  ear pods, watch, and phone together.  All you see is basically the phone in a vertical position.  And the bonus is...  only a single power cord to plug in.  (BTW the charging brick comes with it).  Devices charge efficiently and within a reasonable timeframe.I was so impressed with this charging station I actually bought an additional one 2 days after opening the first box.  As a gift, my son loved it.  My 3rd purchase will be going to my dear wife (she is now a convert also)No more multiple wires and charging plugins.As the headline says...  ""Get'em while you can"".  You can't go wrong with this choice!

    I purchased this charger because of its wireless charging capabilities and am extremely pleased with the performance.  The charger seems to charge my iPhone quicker than the plug in charger that I have been using.  It has the added features of charging my Apple watch as well.  There is also a function for charging Apple Earbuds which I have not used as I do not own any of these.  All three functions will work at one time as well!  I keep this charger on the nightstand when I go to bed and in the morning both my phone and watch are fully charged.  I could not be happier with this product and recommend it highly.  If you have a need for this type a product just get it!

    I thought it would be great to have my phone, watch and AirPods all on one charger.  I love the phone and watch charger but the AirPod charger is kind of a pain.  Maybe it’s because I have big hands but I can’t pull the charging case off the charging plug without knocking both the phone and watch off their charging positions.  Like I said, I think it’s a “me” problem.  I really like having all my devices in one place and having my phone standing upright so I can easily glance over at it is great.

    I was having an issue with my previous Apple Watch not charging overnight. Waking up to a dead watch was getting annoying. I searched for a new stand & came across this 3 in 1. It has been great to have less chargers. I do need to take my phone out if its case because I have a pop socket mounted on the back, but that isn’t a deal breaker for me.

    My iPhone 8+ is starting to downgrade due to its age and with Apple being predatory about trying to force people to upgrade. With that, I’ve been having some charging issues. However, the wireless charging provided with this device makes it fast and simple to charge my phone. No hassle. I was also gifted an older Apple Watch, which charges easily on this stand. I do not own AirPods, so I am not able to say what the charging for AirPods is like with this charging station, but I’m sure it works just as well as the wireless charging spots.

    I purchased this wireless charger and love it. This charger works great, charges fast, and is easy to use. I loved it so much that I bought two more for my kids.

    Great product, space saver! Takes up less space than having cords for your phone, watch, and AirPods. Only downside is the time it takes to charge watch definitely much slower than actual watch charger.

    On a previous charger - different brand - it seemed to give me problems in charging my Apple Watch. I'd have to keep pressing the back of the watch against the charging stand to make ""just the right contact."" With this stand, I don't have to press the back of the watch tight to begin the charge - works very well in that regard. Two things I'd recommend to make this produce even better would be to add a charging light for the watch. And though it's not super bothersome, the charging light for the phone projects onto the ceiling, creating a soft glow. It's not super bright, but if that charging light could go off after a minute or so, I think that would be a plus. It's definitely not a deal breaker, but just a suggestion.

I bought an android one as a gift for my boyfriend at Christmas and he loved it so I figured I’d get myself an apple one.It clears up so many cords and I can charge all of my things in one place. I don’t usually charge all three things at the same time but it does fast charge my phone and watch at the same time. I honestly love it!

    I bought two different wireless chargers as I couldn't decide which one I liked better.  Hands down Anlmz wireless charger is the better one to buy.  This charger can charge my iPhone, apple watch, and iPod all at the same time.  I like the compact design, which doesn't take much room on my nightstand.  I love it so much that I bought the same wireless charger for my desk at work.  As an extra bonus I can't believe how inexpensive this charger was.  Overall, I love everything about this charger.

    I bought this item to charge my Apple Watch and my iPhone while I’m just binge watching streaming tv. It charges my items fairly quickly and I love that it has the attachment to charge my AirPods as well. This leaves me with my phone charger to be used to charge my MacBook Air. I would highly recommend this item!!

    I got this charging device for my husband's office where he already has so much clutter on his work desk.I love that it is so reasonably priced but aesthetically pleasing with such a compact design.  It charges everything he needs while he's at work...his phone, his air pods and his watch which he sometimes forgets to charge at home. He is very happy with my choice, and I highly recommend this to anyone!

    What I like most about this charging station is that everything is already loaded into it. I had a previous one that my iPhone 15 with an OtterBox case had to sit on specifically in order to charge. That is not an issue with this one.Also, my previous one had a spot to hang my Apple Watch but I had to run the cord from a USB adapter built-in inside to the location it sat on. That is also not the case with this one.My AirPods are able to sit in the protective case, and the charging adapter is long enough to reach it without having to take it out.I absolutely love off.

    I got this specifically for my mom who has both a iPhone 14 and an Apple Watch. She used to have a lay-flat type wireless phone charger (which itself takes up more space than this charger) plus a separate watch charger, all on a very tiny end table with other papers and pens and various work things.This charger is great. Saves her a ton of space, and both chargers seem to work just fine. We haven’t timed how fast each thing charges compared to the old chargers, but nothing is dying on her during the work day so no complaints!Side note- it doesn’t have a crazy bright light either, just a tiny blue light at the bottom that comes on while charging (but it faces the phone’s screen, not facing out) so it’s not distracting at all- bonus!

    Love everything about this charger. It made a mess of cords and tidied it up to just one plug. It also helps me remember to charge my Apple Watch every night, as I would forget to do so often. I would highly recommend

    To charge the phone takes too much time adjusting the  phone to receiver signal to charge

    I first bought my wife one as a gift and saw how great and compact it was!  So I purchased one for myself. This is an excellent charger which I use for both my iPhone and Apple Watch. It is compact and fits neatly on my night stand.  There are no issues with charging multiple devices at the same time. I also like the fact the phone is upright so you can tap it to see the time or turn off any alarms easily. I also like the fact there is only one cord to deal with making the whole setup neatly organized. This would be an ideal setup for the office too.

    The charger works as intended to provide battery power to Apple Watch, Air Pods and iPhones. The design of the station is sturdy and you can tell it is high-quality. It solved my problem of cable management and lack of outlets for these three devices. It looks cool, too! You will have to take the case off your phone to charge it. Another pointer is I recommend plugging this station directly into a wall for best performance. When plugged into my desk via USB, it did not receive enough power to charge my phone. Works fine when plugged into the wall or power strip.

    This 3 in 1 charger is such a great idea!  I wish I had thought of it. I didn’t give it 5 stars ONLY because you have to be sure that the phone is sitting on the charger EXACTLY as it should or the phone will not charge.

    We didn’t need the AirPod charger part; the watch and phone chargers work perfectly )with an iPhone XR). It is so convenient having just one plug and two devices charging on the bedside table, plus it takes up less space than separate chargers. The almost vertical position of the phone on the charger allows hands free viewing. In fact, after confirming that it would work with our in-laws phones, I ordered two more as gifts. And they are just as happy as we are.

    If you're like me, iPhone, Apple Watch, air pods on your bedside table, then you know the problems with charging..... cables everywhere. Plus, my charger port on my iPhone is getting loose where half the time it doesn't even charge. Frustrated, I decided to get a magnet charger to at least hand that charging issue when I came across this little device. I do charge my watch and that another cable and I do charge my Air pods and that's another cable in another location and I always forget where I put them, so this looked like a perfect solution, and it is. I now have one device for everything. It comes with a long power cable (no cube) so you have plenty of space to move it around. I also charge my air pods there, so I always know where they are. I was traveling this week and I brought along, and it was perfect. One spot, one plug for everything. I'm actually buying another one just to keep in my carryon so I always it for traveling. I only write reviews for things that extremely disappoint me or for things that really impress me and this device impressed me and made my life so much easier.

    I charge my iPhone, Apple Watch, and ear buds every night on my nightstand. I was annoyed by all of the different charging chords, so when I saw this all in one charger on Amazon, I decided to give it a try. It has made it so much more convenient and visually appealing to charge all of my electronics in one spot. It charges quickly and is so easy to use. I also bring it with me when I travel to use when I stay in a hotel. I am extremely pleased with my purchase!
