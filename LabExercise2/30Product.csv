    I had a Logitech G604 for a few years before switching over to this mouse due to Logitech double-click issues.  I use the mouse for gaming/office, but I'm no pro gamer.The sensors feel about equal.  Logitech is supposed to be much better but I don't notice a difference.  Both mice have an easy to use dpi switch.  Redragon is slightly shorter in length which I prefer, otherwise similar size.  Button click quality is similar.  Logitech has the better body material, but it gets dirty so quick that I actual prefer the more plastic look of Redragon.  Redragon has LED.  Button layout is different but both are easy to get used to.  Logitech with the battery is heavier than the Redragon with all the weights, but it's a similar feeling on the desk.Switched from Logitech G604 (3 years) to Redragon M908 (2 months)DIFFERENCESRedragon is wired.  Changing batteries is annoying, but rarely needed.  For me the wire is fine on the desk, but on-the-go users will like the Logitech better.Logitech also has a sensor/bluetooth switch, allowing for use on two different computers.  Redragon is plug-and-play on one computer at a time, but does a better job at on-boarding macros.Logitech has the fly-wheel scrolling.  As nice as it is, it's not really noticable when you don't have the option.  Unless you access a huge table to scroll through...  Logitech also has left/right switches on the wheel, which I found annoying.Logitech has major double click issues.  Tried on two mice and changed the switch, still problems.  Those started about 9-12 months into using the mouse, so too early to compare to Redragon but it turned me off Logitech.SIMILARITIESThe sensors feel about equal.  Logitech is supposed to be much better but I don't notice a difference.  Both mice have an easy to use dpi switch.Redragon is slightly shorter in length which I prefer, otherwise similar size.  Logitech has the better body material, but it gets dirty so quick that I actual prefer the more plastic look of Redragon.  Redragon has LED.  Logitech with the battery is heavier than the Redragon with all the weights, but it's a similar feeling on the desk.Button click quality feels the same.  Button layout is different but both are easy to get used to.CONCLUSIONLogitech's only true strength was the 2-computer wireless feature.  But that alone doesn't justify the very high price compared to the Redragon.  If the Redragon doesn't suffer the same double-click issues after a year, then I'll easily prefer the wired solution than the double-click frustrations.  Time will tell though.  I'll vote 5*, easily will buy Redragon again after this, no more Logitech.

    The Redragon M913 is as good as any mouse I've ever owned, and better than many. I've owned many Logitech and Razer mouses that have cost 2-4 times what this mouse does, and none of them have been any better. In fact, I've never had any mouse last more than 2 years without developing some sort of problem needing a replacement mouse. This can get expensive. I've only had this one for a couple weeks, but if it lasts a year, it was money well spent.The good.Tracks perfectly. Very comfortable. Many buttons. Wired and wireless. Adjustable DPI. Easy to use macro software. RGB can be turned off or customized. All the buttons are recognized by Windows out of the box. The 1-12 buttons are programmed as keyboard 1-9, 0, and +, -. The extra front button is programmed as a triple left click. This makes it easy to assign keybinds in games without using macros.The bad.The twelve side buttons are small. The sensor prefers a mouse pad, and it stutters on my bare desk surface. Some people complain about the macro software, but it's similar to any other, and easy to use. Some people complain about no Bluetooth, but the 2.4 ghz works perfectly in my setup. When switching from wired to wireless (by unplugging the USBC) it takes several seconds to restablish a connection. Some say it's hard to pick up to recenter the cursor, but that has not been the case for me.Overall.This is an outstanding mouse, especially at the price point. I would certainly buy it again. However, after some use, I would maybe prefer the version that only has 8 side buttons (plus forward and back buttons).  My only gripe is that the 12 side buttons are small and hard to orient my tumb on the desired button without glancing at the mouse first. The model with 8 side buttons looks a little easier to navigate as the buttons are more spaced apart. Ignore the comments about the macro software. It's easy to use if you've ever programmed macros before. Even if you haven't, there are short YouTube videos that walk you through the process if you need them.If you want a multi button, multi function, high DPI, programmable gaming mouse at a great price, this is it. No regrets.

    So let me preface this as to why I purchased this new mouse. I am mostly an MMO player that also casually plays a variety of other games and I was previously using an original Razer Naga. It was the perfect mouse for me, fit well, worked well and the software was great. After having it for over 10 years the left click switch finally started going soft and the newer version of the Razer Synapse software no longer supported it leaving me constantly fighting with the older version not saving my button maps to the cloud properly and also requiring me to redo them.My initial inclination was to replace it with the new Naga but they made a lot of changes to the design of it. First off they changed the body shape so it didn't feel as nice in my hand and secondly they removed one of my favorite features of the two buttons on the top corner of the left click button.After searching MMO mice on Amazon I came across the Redragon Impact which had a lot of good reviews, had a similar body shape to my original Naga and had at least 1 top button on the left click button. It also happened to be on sale and Amazon was offering a coupon on top of it that day so it was at a great price. All those things considered I thought it was worth a shot.When I received it the packing was in good shape and it came in a sturdy plastic case. Installing it was pretty straightforward. Plug it in, go to Redragons website and download the software. I've been using it for about 3 weeks now and as far as the the feel of it I like the shape and size, it fits well in my hand and the pinky rest extends out further than my previous mouse allowing to rest more of my hand on the mouse. The weight of it is a little bit lighter than I would prefer even with all of the included weights inside of it and the overall feel of it seems a little less solid than my Naga was, I'm assuming it's due to a thinner or different type of plastic used for the shell.The Left click, right click and top button all feel and respond well, the side buttons I actually like the shape and layout much more than my Naga, I can reach the back row much more naturally on this mouse, but the response of the buttons are a little on the stiff side. Maybe they'll loosen up a little over time but I'd prefer them to be a little easier to press.The software is fairly straightforward, very utility driven layout if a little on the cluttered side of the UI but it gets the job done. It allows for multiple profiles to be setup, the only thing it lacks is the ability to automatically switch profiles based on the application running. For someone like me who likes to customize my button maps to my mouse over several games it requires me to manually go in and switch to the various profiles before loading up the game and remembering to switch back to another when going to a different game.All in all this is a good buy for the cost of the mouse, I'm not yet certain I will keep this as my primary mouse as I may go to a Logitech or Corsair simply for the better software, but for the time being I'm happy with the purchase.

    I bought this thing for streaming on Twitch as I wanted to be able to have all of my scene changes, backgrounds, sounds, and so on, bound to buttons so that I would not have to use my keyboard.  It is a great purchase.  The customization for this thing is something I never would have thought I would see in a mouse.  You can put macros on your buttons, you can change the lighting to any possibility available, you can change what the mouse buttons actually do, and you can add or remove weights to this mouse to get yourself a better and more personal feel.  I really do love this thing.My rating is 4/5 instead of 5/5 because the right click is already failing me.  I have not had this thing a whole year yet but the right click is to the point to where I either have to tap it several times in advance to make sure it is ready to use or I have to contort my fingers to reach the further back on the mouse so that it activates.  I know this is not correct and not due to usage because the left click has seen way more usage and still works perfectly.  This thing has damn near 20 different buttons and they all function properly except the right click!  It is like there is something stuck in it that has to be pushed out the way.  I cleaned the mouse, sprayed it out with compressed air, opened and inspected it, and I connect find a reason why it is this way.  I have other RedDragon mice and they all work perfectly.  This one started to act crazy after about 3 months.  I contacted RedDragon and am going to see how their warranty works out.  If I can get it repaired or replaced, I'll update this review with the results.Right click aside, this is still a terrific mouse.  Even if I knew I'd get this right click problem I'd still buy it just for the usefulness and customization this mouse offers.  A great product, great idea, and great execution.------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATEAfter submitting a request to Redragon and talking to support, I was able to get the problem fixed.  It was just a small piece under the right click that had slipped out of place.  Once I took it off and placed it back on, it worked just like new!  I am not even sure how I missed that but I am super glad I don't have to send my mouse off or order a new one.  A+ customer service and product.  Just ordered a mechanical keyboard from them and I think I'm a fanboy now.

    update:customer service was super helpful and fast to send a replacement and the new one seems to be working just fine, no issues with switching to wireless, no input lag, looks great and feels greatold review:as im writing this i cant use wireless, i plugged it in to charge and now that it's full battery every time i unplug the charger it refuses to work, ive given it time to switch, waited several minutes before trying everything else, ive tried unplugging and replugging the dongle like 10 times and trying different usb ports and still nothing, ive tried turning it on and off on the bottom several times and still nothing, ive tried replugging the charger back in and unplugging it again and still refuses to work while unplugged, last time i charged it i had the same issues and eventually, after like 45 minutes, it worked while unplugged but it seems it'll be an issue every time i want to switch to wireless after charging, i was so excited to finally have a white mmo mouse since it doesnt seem to be something any of the bigger mouse brands want to make but this is just too frustrating to deal with every single time i need to charge itthe buttons on the side also feel very cheap like one's gonna get stuck or fall off in the near futurebut i mean hey it looks clean and pretty i guess

    Great price for great entry level quality. Ergonomically comfortable and long battery life, still haven't charged it once since purchasing. Also comes with eco mode for longer battery life, and the software for light effects is easy to use. Would highly recommend.

    I purchased this mouse after going through three Logitech G602s; I loved those mice, except that they used a click mechanism which rapidly failed. Trying to RMA the final one required me to go through a ton of steps, so instead of dealing with that or rewarding Logitech with yet another purchase I sought out an alternative. I was a bit ""Goldilocks"" about it, wanting a wireless mouse with a lot of buttons, and after extensive searching I purchased this after a friend recommended Redragon.And... it's fine. I don't regret the purchase, it fulfills the need, but I have enough issues that I could only give a weak recommendation if you really need a lot of buttons (like I did). Note about context: I use this primarily for ""slower"" games like Stardew Valley and Subnautica, as well as daily use; I have a Logitech G502 I use for games that require lighting response such as online FPSs or Rocket League.Ergonomics is where it easily excels: I love the shape and my hand rests incredibly well on it. I was initially concerned because a lot of wireless mice I had looked at were on the small size and the images didn't give me a good idea if it would work for my big, meaty man hands but this is probably the most comfortable mouse I have ever used. Despite the size, though, it's incredibly light and can be far too easy to move around (DPI settings can only counter this so much).I would like to see them increase the battery capacity, which would help with the weight and also address the battery life. It's not horrible, but for a heavy user like myself who makes sure to turn it off at night I have to recharge it once a week. (For reference, the Logitech mentioned and a wireless Anker I also use only have to have batteries swapped once a month, if that.) Thankfully recharging can be done by just attaching the included USB-C, during which the mouse itself still works fine, so this isn't a big issue.As for using the mouse, the left/right click are quite responsive and satisfying. I actually found the left-click to be overly-responsive, as the mouse seemed to send a mouse-down command at a regular interval when I had polling set to 1000 Hz. Actually pressing the left-mouse would correct it, and dropping the polling to 500 Hz seemed to make the issue go away.A month of use out I'm still not sure how I feel about the plethora of buttons on the left side--the primary reason I bought the mouse. The number is great, but the size makes it easy to accidentally press more than one at once. The shape and placement also makes it hard to differentiate between each by feel, and the travel required for some (like #10) is quite awkward. There is a ""home"" bump on #5 but that doesn't really do much. I expect I'll get used to them over time, but it will be through rote use/memorization rather than a pleasant layout. I would have been happier with fewer buttons that were larger and easy to identify through touch. The extra button beside the left-click works great.The software... exists. It has crashed or emergency-quit on my Win7Pro machine a few times in response to switching the mouse between wireless and wired without me first turning the mouse to ""Off"", but this has never caused a large issue. The UI leaves a lot to be desired, but I can easily access options without having to dive through menus/screens. Changing the DPI on the mouse (via non-customizable buttons) shows an overlay which has caused slowdown in the game being played (no apparent option to turn this off.)  It doesn't offer profile switching (something I dearly miss from the Logitech), but you can import/export profiles so manual swapping is possible. The single largest improvement the software could have is a drop-down of profiles to simplify swapping, even if still manual.Quick thoughts: The RGB is weird (the ""breathing"" setting does not act as I expect, nor keep the exact color I selected) but as I don't care about it and can turn it off completely it's fine. The right side has a coating that feels slick or that very easily holds onto finger oil, so I often think I've gotten it dirty. This has diminished over time, though. The size might make it unwieldy for those with smaller hands and require more desk space for proper travel.In short, do I think someone would be content with this mouse? Sure. Do I think that someone /should/ buy this mouse? Ehhhh.

    I have been using this mouse just shy of a year as I had purchased this to replace my aging Redragon M901 due to a wonky middle mouse button. I hope this review can serve as an indicator for this being a good product.The M913 felt a tad bigger than my previous mouse but was still as comfortable. There is now a lip at the left side of the mouse for your thumb to rest on which I didn't even know I needed. There was no awkwardness with the ergonomics and overall feel when transitioning from the M901 to the M913 as they felt almost the same. Another improvement is that the mouse click while not quiet is much less noisy than the M901.One of the greatest pros of this mouse to me is the fact that it can be used wired or wireless. I can't review on RGB and customization as I use this mouse on ""econo"" mode that disables the RGB. This is done via a switch located underneath the mouse. I use it on Ubuntu so there is no support from the vendor with respect to their software but I do know there are third party options that can be used to control the RGB if so desired. The battery life is amazing, lasting about a month of everyday usage on econo mode.I do have a couple of complaints though. The scroll wheel can occasionally be way too sensitive as just a slight touch would cause it to scroll. The other minor complaint I have is that is seems to be a gunk magnet particularly where the ring finger rests. I find this odd as the surface is almost entirely a smooth piano black surface as opposed to my previous mouse which was a rough texture and never had this issue.Beside the minor cons I had, I think this mouse is worth the money especially at the price point. It works well for everyday tasks and I have put it through the paces for some gaming sessions with Diablo 4, Assassin Creed and Shadow of War to name a few. I have gotten so accustomed to MMO mouse for regular gaming that It would be awkward to go back to a regular mouse but fortunately it is made accessible with products like this due to the pricing when compared to some of the other brands that cost a premium.

    I loved my last Redragon mulit-button mouse, but after a number of years the buttons became unreliable, so I upgraded.Overall, this is a good mouse, especially for the price; having multiple profiles is huge, the lighting is fun (though not as versatile as I expected, but ore than my last one) and programming buttons is important (and you have PLENTY.)  I actually didn't need allll these buttons, but I discovered the mouse I was looking at only had 2 profiles, and I wanted at least 3.The cord is very flexible and stays out of the way (my last one was rigid and was always awkward on the desk.)  I like that the DPI buttons show 1-4 lighting levels.Okay, the cons:1) Someone mentioned in their review the pinky section being slightly too short.  YES.  It has actually been difficult to get used to, and I've found it distracting.  The problem is, it would be better if there was no pinky support, or full pinky support, but because it's neither, your pinky has the illusion of support without fully receiving it.  The tip of my pinky is awkwardly dangling.  Maybe I'll eventually get used to it, but it was more distracting than I expected.  My last mouse had no pinky support, and I never thought about it.2) It's slightly bigger than my last mouse, enough that it feels big in my hand.  I'm sure I'll get used to that too, but it feels less ergonomic.3) The software means well but is VERY glitchy.  It took a while to figure out because the functionality is needlessly complicated or disjointed in places (ie. past software it was easy to add custom keystrokes to buttons; this one adds an entirely different macro section that has been finicky, like doubling keystrokes when recording).  Worse, I can't even open the app most of the time, and have to force-close it in task manager for it to respond.  I am also denied access to naming the profiles, as at says I can't ""alter the default profile"" on every profile.Update:After more use, I'm finding more issues.  The mode button is not working correctly.  Normally, when you push it, you can tell the mode based on your lighting settings. This one just has random lighting pop up that has not been set, which means I have to change the mode from the software.Update 2:I added a star because the Company took initiative to address the issues, which is rare at a time when most companies are scaling back customer service.

    I used the Logitech MX Master 2 for a few years until I damaged the mouse. I first tried the Logitech MX Master 3 as a replacement but after a few days I decided to return it.  I wanted more buttons and shortcuts and I found this mouse after doing research.  At first I was skeptical due to the price (seemed too cheap) but the reviews were good.  Then I realized it's just some plastic and the margins on these mice must be huge.With the Red Dragon it took a short time to remember all the shortcuts but it was easy enough to program and I tried a few combinations until I settled on the following based on frequency of use:1. screencapture (trigger button)2. browser forward / browser back3. page up / page down4. voice transcription (win+shift+H)5. image to text (win+shift+t) via powertools6. next browser tab / previous browser tab7. zoom in / zoom out8. vol up / vol downAt first the mouse felt a little bit too light and a little bit too wide, but I got over that quickly and it feels quite natural. The rechargeable battery lasts a long time, much longer than my MX 2.  Programmable buttons are easy to put to memory.The only downside which is minor is the lack of premium feel. This is a really minor downside;  Form and Function with a little less Feel, the mouse is great.

    My second time getting an mmo mouse from Red Dragon (previously the black mmo mouse). I wanted a white one this time and it's really nice.My only complaint is the mouse wheel feels rather loose when scrolling. Feels like it needs more pushing, which is usually fine but during lots of internet browsing/etc that adds up and makes my index finger kinda sore.The 1-12 button are really great and responsive. I have small hands for an adult so using my thumb on the mouse instead of 1-0 for gaming is great.  And the ring/pinky grip on the side is THE BEST. Keeps your hand from rubbing all over your mousepad. Just really ergonomic and I love that.You CAN turn OFF the rgb if you download the software which was easy enough to find. My old mouse by another company didnt have that feature and Id had to electrical tape over the obnoxious glow.For improvement Id like to see a version that has some texture to it? This mouse is super smooth and not in a good way (to me). Also seems to make my hand sweat more.

    Even as a computer nerd, I was hesitant to get a mouse with so many buttons just from an ease of use perspective, but I've been using this mouse for a month now and it's been an amazing experience and huge productivity boost, especially if your work/personal life requires being on the computer for hours. Even better, it only took a few days to get used to the extra buttons (only accidentally clicked one a couple times in the last 30 days).One big perks is there are 5 modes you can switch between, and for each mode you can give unique assignments to every button, so you can switch between modes for different workflows and assign well over 75 shortcuts/macros (15+ per mode). Even better, once you program the buttons for the 5 different modes on the mouse, it stores everything on the mouse itself, so you can hook up the mouse to any PC and use all of the buttons/macros you saved without downloading the Red Dragon software or saving the macro files anywhere, which is great if your company's IT department is stricter and doesn't allow installation of 3rd party software or plugging in USB drives.For each button you program with a macro (again, up to 15+ buttons per mode), you can tell it to either 1) loop a specific number of times (min 1, max 255), 2) repeat for as long as the button is held down, or 3) repeat until you click the button a second time. My job involves a lot of repetitive motions/tasks so this has made my job so much easier, I can automate quite a few tasks and sit back while the mouse clicks through things for me, switches across tabs/windows, etc.Definitely a game changer in my book for people seeking next gen productivity.

    TLDR; get this mouse before you spend twice as much on the other 2 big brands.I’ve had many gaming mice over the years and decided to try this one after my 3rd Corsair scimitar elite gave out after just a couple of years which I had switched to after multiple failed Razer naga.  I obviously can’t attest to the longevity of this mouse yet but right out of the box it feels way better than those other ones that cost twice as much.  The side buttons are angled and give you a better sense of which button you’re on.  The adjustable weight is really nice since I’m a female with small hands and as such I was worried about the size but it’s way better fitting than the Corsair without being small like the naga.  The fact that it comes in white is a major plus too. Now I need the keyboard haha. The only reason I didn’t give this 5 stars is the inability to program just Alt with a number as a side button.  Shift and curl and shift with alt work fine though so I had to just redo a few of my gaming keybinds to get the mouse to do what I’m used to.  The rapid fire button that you can change is also really cool as that’s a new thing for me.

    Been using it for a few months now and I love it. Beats every other big name brand out there selling mice like this for upwards of 60 dollars. It fits my hand so perfectly and I can grip it perfectly with my whole hand as opposed to other brand mice where my pinky normally hangs off the side and gets very uncomfortable over time. The smooth plastic on the key pad and rest for ring/pinky finger make cleaning it off super easy unlike some others I bought and needed a pick of some sort to get between the rubber. 10/10 will only buy mice from these guys from now on.

    I think its a good product. I dislike the thumb rest thingy and it was hard to get used to that. I've had 3 or 4 g600s before this thing and loved those but they are made badly and break, and now are discontinued. I'd think this would be pretty amazing without that thumb rest that annoys me. It's light, responsive enough, software is ok, colorful, well the dpi switch sometimes does get hit too easily on top of the mouse. Maybe they could design that a bit better so it's not accidentally set off.

    Its taking me a while to get uses to the feel of this mouse.  Its a lot wider than my old mouse.  I bought it for the number pad on the side.  I guess I have a big thumb as it is hard to select the right number button.  They are angled to try and select the right button and I will keep trying.  The battery life is shorter than my previous mouse that has RGB lights.  I do like the feel of the thumb wheel and buttons.  I like that you can adjust the DPI with a simple button push.  Not to crazy of the triple shot button, would like to be able to adjust the sensitivity of it.  The last issue is the software that you install on your PC to program the mouse.  It took a lot of work to get around McAfee web to download and install.  No clear instructions on how to get around it.  I purchased this mouse not for gaming but music writing with MuseScore.  It makes it quicker to press the number buttons on the mouse than taking your hand off the mouse and press a keyboard pad.  Worth the price and well built.  Takes getting use to but feel good in hand, that is if you have a large hand.  Great control.  Does take time to charge but you can either plug it in a usb charger or into your computer and not bother with the dongle.  Have fun.  Maybe I'll play MIST with it.

    I originally picked up the Redragon M811 to see if I could get used to using an MMO mouse and I was really impressed with it, but wished it had a few more buttons. I purchased this one hoping it would do the trick. This one is much lower profile than the original which I think is part of the problem.I have no trouble locating buttons side to side as they are angled enough to feel where you are, but the buttons are too small and too close together to quickly feel where you are on them when going up and down. It's usable, but much slower than the other one.  I tried gaming with it for a couple of weeks and have given up. It works great for video and photo editing however or I imagine any game that doesn't require fast and precise input.Also, there is no Mac application for this mouse, but as it has onboard memory you can bind the buttons on a windows machine and then use it on a Mac.

    I have been using Redragon since I got my very first laptop. Honestly, never fails on me, everything works no matter how much you use it. I had an earlier version that has been dropped over a dozen times over the course of 5 years, the only thing wrong with it, is number 5 side button is waring out slightly. I highly recon these over the expensive razor brand of mice.

    If you've already gotten your muscle memory and software configured for for 4 rows of 3 buttons from previous Redragon mice, your going to have to redo all that to get used to 4 rows of 4 buttons.  The M990 gives you more total side buttons but I didn't want to take the time and effort to rewire my brain and redo the button layout in my game to match the extra buttons.  Also the last row of buttons (13, 14, 15, 16) is physically a tiny bit further back than the last row of buttons (10, 11, 12) on the earlier M901, M908 mice and it felt like I was straining my thumb to reach it.I already knew the Redragon mouse config software was non-intuitive and frustrating to use, but I don't understand why the software is so different between the different models.  After lots of trial and error I can program the M901 mouse how I want.  The M990 software is just as non-intuitive and frustating but in a new way.If this is your first side-button mouse, none of this should be a problem.  If you've already been using Redragon side-button mice, just know you are going to have to adjust to the M990.

    I been wanting to buy a ""gaming"" mouse for ages but always thought it was ridiculous. But... every now and then I'd play a game that I just really needed some sorta hotkey or macro thing but it was too annoying to have to bind and rebind the mouse buttons or rebind all my keys just to have to rebind them again after reinstalling or I couldn't hecking remember what I even mapped everything to the very next day.I was a fool. I'm never getting a normal mouse ever again.Pros- I'm a big boy so the total 0.04lbs(19.5g) the weights add don't really help all that much but it has given me an idea to jerryrig it with some heavier metals. Very good idea overall. Makes you shooty real good.- I love multiple dpi levels so having FIVE different ones is amazing. Sometimes a game thinks 800 DPI means you should whip across the screen just by breathing but with this instead of fumbling in the settings for twenty minutes I can just lower my DPI.- As edgy and somewhat confusing as the program is for this mouse, it's very very helpful and can even bind macros and use the F13-F24 keys.- The gratuitous amount of buttons are wonderful, if there's any extra amount of nonsense an MMO tries demanding I press, I just bind those to the side of the mouse. I missed my back and forward buttons but I just bound those to 1 and 4 and problem solved.- There are multiple profiles that you can even swap to with one of the macros for those of course that play many many games and wish to have a profile for each game or each class yadda yadda.- It is 100% fully customizable, even the mouse buttons can be changed. You can rebind left click, you can rebind right click, middle click, scroll wheel, and if you don't swap between DPI at all you can even rebind the dpi buttons to do something else.- It's got gamer stickers for your PC tower or whatever if you're a weirdo who needs those.- This thing comes in an adorable little carepackage case lookin' thing. Even the weights have a tiny case.- RGB go brr. (Very customizable for any setup.)Cons- Nothing tells you where to download the fricken fracken software. I just googled red dragon software (which is not what this is) then proceeded to google ""redragon"" software and found it that way.- The program for this mouse as mentioned before is somewhat confusing.- This could entirely be because I am stupid but I thought auto-fire meant rapid fire. At first it didn't seem to fire or automatically do so either. Upon further testing it does more of a burst fire sorta thing. I thought I was supposed to just hold it down and it'd rapid fire but I guess not. This can be adjusted to fire more than a few times and adjust the ""delay"" but setting the delay to 0 doesn't do squat.- Maybe my hands are just a bit big but this ergonomic mouse doesn't feel very ergonomic. I've since just put my hand on it at an angle and it feels better but I can tell that's not the way it was designed.

    I just go this mouse and the thing hate about it the dpi button 😒 You can't change them to help you in game beside change the dpi with is the speed of the mouse. The light are change able and side button are okay it not there going to on any other mouse.  Wireless connection is perfect so no delays but no Bluetooth with okay with me.

    Completely equivalent to a Razer naga in quality and functionality, I'd even say I prefer the ergonomics of the red dragon over the razer naga. Only negative you lose with the price tag is the cord is made of a less strong material then the naga but after a month in a half I can't complain about any issues with cord as of yet. Also I would like to note the only other complaint is because I got the white and they shiny plastic its made out of dirt tends to show easier then the black on the naga. Other then that I actually prefer it over the naga and I've used the naga for close to 5 years. I prefer it even with the trade offs.

    I bought the reddragon tkl keyboard and the m913 wireless mmo mouse after my 3rd razer mouse died. I have used razer for the longest time paying the high prices but after my 3 mouse died I thought there's no way I game that much so I thought I would give the reddragon a try and I'm glad I did i like the mouse and keyboard. I was apprehensive coming from wired mouse and keyboard that the wireless ones would lag when playing fps games but I was pleasantly surprised to see how little lag if any there was.cons: If your coming from Razer software to the reddraggon software I would have to say its a down grade. While the macros worked the software was buggy and i haven't been able to tune macros as much as I would like but with any software once you find the bug you can work around it. If they made their software better I would pay double the price of the mouse. If this mouse dies the same speed as razer then atleast im saving money. Anyways

    I got this to play World of Warcraft. I was able to easily download the configuration app from the website. Configuration is a bit tricky to figure out. I suggest watching a short YouTube on it. The side buttons are comfortable. The only issue I have with them is if I have to pick up my mouse to reposition, I sometimes press a button which can cause problems if I’m mounted and I hit a button that dismounts me while I’m in the air. Splat Lol. The feel of the mouse is slick. The wheel turns nice but I kind of wish it was a bit more “clicky”. It’s a heavy mouse but I haven’t taken any of the weights out yet because I can’t get the little cover off the bottom. This is probably not an issue for everyone. I’m disabled so it could be I’m just not strong enough to do it. But even with it being a bit heavy it’s not a big deal. I feel the mouse is made more for larger hands as I have to slide my hand back just a bit when I’m using the lower 8 buttons. Again not a big deal.  I have long fingers though so more compact mice tend to feel cramped. The cable is nice, braided and soft with a Velcro strap to keep extra under control. And the bottom is metal and slides along very well. All in all I’m very happy with my purchase. Oh and it’s very pretty when it’s all lit up 😁

    I have had plenty of expensive gaming mice in my life, including razor naga trinity, high-end logitech mice, etc.  I got this mouse for my wife since it was cheaper and she is less picky.  After trying it out, I noticed it performed really well and felt really comfortable in my hand.  I ended up buying one for myself as well and was absolutely astonished by how long the battery lasts.  It advertises 45 hours but I will literally use it all day for weeks on end before it needs a charge.  Granted, this is on eco mode which turns off the RGB, but even with RGB on it was lasting well over 50 hours.  HIGHLY recommend, do not waste 100 dollars on a mouse that's going to give you the same performance with less battery life.  This mouse is an absolute gold mine.

    (READ THIS FOR GENUINE HONEST REVIEW) Id rate probaby a 3.7-4 out of 5 I purchased this mouse to replace my redragon sniper pro, specifically wanted a wired mouse with the buttons on the side and this fit the bill, downloading the software for it is straightforward and allows complete customization with the rgb colors and button programing which is extremely nice, love the adjustable weights. The build quality seems pretty decent and I love the feel of the ""click"" of the mouse, it's just very pleasing, not sure if it's just cause it's new or what. The cord does infact have a braided wrap, it feels kind of like a shoe string if that makes sense, but it's extremely bendable and moves easy which is great because it keeps the cord out of the way. Honestly the only thing keeping this from a 5 star review is the way it feels in the hand. The left side of the mouse is basically flat except for on the bottom which has the ""ergonomic"" part at the bottom. Now I understand it's pretty much flat because of the buttons so I'd be willing to forgive that, but when combined with the right side, makes it kind of hard to pick up and move when gaming, the right side has a kind of divot for your pinky than another rest ledge type thing for your ring finger, but they are both EXTREMELY smooth, almost slippery infact, which with the flat face of the left side, like I said, makes it a little different to pick up and move the mouse when gaming, like if your trying to target something and run out of room so you need to lift it up and move it further over to keep tracking a certain direction. It's not bad, it just takes some getting used to. However I like to play with basically the lowest dpi preset because I'm extremely precise with my movements, if your more of a twitchy style gamer and use a higher dpi you won't have this issue at all. Now I've only had this mouse for less than a week but so far I'm really enjoying it. I will update the review if I have any issues with the mouse that warrent changing the review.

    After a month of use I have had no major problems. In fact, aside from the software being annoying I haven’t had any issues.Mapping side buttons can only be done by the vendor software. The side buttons are actually a partial keyboard separate in the device manager from the mouse. As Windows has issues with not recognizing which keyboard a key press comes from, the remapping software changes a memory switch inside the mouse itself.However, once I got it mapped properly I quickly was able to increase my productivity.

    I'm a CPA and I purchased this mouse for data entry. I use the number keys 1-10 to input those numbers in the various software I use. I use the other buttons for delete, backspace, and, enter.

    I've been learning (slowly) the ancient Bethesda Creation Kit for Skyrim.  It has quite a few keyboard shortcuts for moving/placing/replacing objects and I've started hating the whole Press-shift, Press Ctrl-F, Press W/E/T and whatever!  So I figured I'd give a programmable mouse a try.  I didn't want to spend too much since I'll probably lose interest in the Creation Kit in about a week anyway. :P  For only $22 on sale it was a pretty easy decision.Mouse came in a nice little solid plastic container which seems like overkill for such a cheap mouse, but whatever.  Mouse itself is pretty solid.  Side buttons are a little small, but I think I can get used to them.  Cord is very soft an pliable which is nice.  Unit came with little weights that can be swapped in and out to adjust the weight.  Though I'm a gamer, I've always thought these weights were a little gimmicky since they don't appreciably change the feel (at least not to me.)  All in all, the mouse seems pretty nice.  The only slight issue I've had is the lack of documentation.  The little tiny booklet that comes with it is kinda useless so I went to the website.  Turns out the same thing is available on the website but in a PDF format so no joy there either.  Luckily I'm a pretty nerdy dude so I soldiered on. :)  After finding and installing the software I fired everything up.  The software was a little less than intuitive, but again, with a little effort you can get it figured out.  The great news is, for a mere $22 you can make software that has lots of frequently used keyboard shortcuts MUCH easier to use.  After getting everything set up I was much more productive after a short time getting used to the button mapping(s).  You can also change the lighting and effects easily through the software and export your profiles so you can use them on other machines (my laptop for instance) without having to remap all the keys.  I haven't tried that just yet, but I'm imaging it'll work fine.  All in all, if your noodling it, just buy one.  :)

    I went from using a wired Logitech MMO mouse to using this one, and I love it so far. It doesn't feel too different from my Logitech but having more LED colors is visually stunning. The scroll wheel is great, and having the addition of a left button for instant trigger (equivalent to 3 left-clicks) is great.The battery life is great so far. I'm only down to 80% after a single charge (which wasn't even a full 0-100% charge) though I've had it on eco mode more often than not so as to not drain the battery.This is my first wireless mouse and I'm already loving not having a lot of wires cluttering my gaming laptop. Also, I use a lap desk on occasion with a built-in (albeit thin) mousepad and I've had no issues with  maneuvering the cursor.The only issue I'm having is with the right click. I have fairly small hands and shorter fingers, so I've been struggling to hit the ""sweet spot"" to do right clicking -- I have to shift my hand up from where my comfort zone is for handling a mouse and it feels a little unnatural. This is also my first ergonomic mouse so it's likely a matter of adjustment or maybe it's just not ergonomic for me in particular, ha. If you have hands/fingers on the smaller or shorter side and require instant right-clicking for your games you may want to find a slightly smaller size (if possible) or get ready to adjust how you handle the mouse/the strength at which you click.TL;DR above: Small hands & fingers, likely a user skill issue, just need to adjust hand positioning and click harder.

    I ordered this mouse back in early 2018, so I got a good year of use out of it. However due to it's low quality, even with careful use it had some notable issues. Only one big one, but that's usually all it takes and in this case it was enough to make the mouse unusable.The first and only non breaking issue I ever had was the side buttons becoming more and more difficult to press. Nothing too bad, but caused a missed input here and there due to the increase in pressure I had to put on the buttons.But that was really the only issue I was having with the mouse, and it was easily manageable.For the software, once I figured it out, it was easy to set up. The lack of Mouse 4 and 5 buttons was replaceable by binding some the side keys to it, and I adapted to using them automatically after a short time. The amount of customization allowed me to set up the mouse the way I liked and how I wanted to use it. It was very nice.The scroll wheel never gave me issues, it clicked when I need it to and scrolled when I wanted it to.Left and right mouse buttons worked fine, never had issues of cracking or breaking, missed inputs or anything.The dpi adjustment buttons could be rebound, so I took them off of any bindings to be safe from accidentally changing my dpi settings, so I can't say much about their quality or functionality.There are two additional buttons I did not use: one at the top left above the left mouse button, which usually just changed the color scheme of the mouse and worked when used but I never really used it. You can change the bindings to the button if I remember correctly which makes it a nice secondary button on the top left of the mouse, but I never bothered as it's a little too out of the way (my small hands would have to shift off the right mouse button to go far enough to press it comfortably)The other button is on the bottom of the mouse, and changes the mode of the mouse. Essentially, this just changes the dpi settings, and the color the mouse to match. I always kept this on the lowest setting as it was plenty high for me on that setting, and you can still adjust it more with your computers mouse settings. Despite it being on the bottom of the mouse, I had no issues with it being pressed accidentally.There is a panel on the bottom of the mouse, which you can open to reveal 7 weights which you can easily remove to change the feel of the mouse. They all pretty small and the mouse it very light without them, I ended up keeping them all in, and I would still consider it on the light side.Finally, the tracker is sealed, which is nice at not letting much hair or dust into the mouse, however this also means you cannot open the mouse in any way to clean any dust or hair out of it.As for what went wrong with the tracker... I don't know. Today the light just went out and moving the mouse no longer moved my cursor. All buttons worked, but not being able to move the cursor made that sort of pointless.It's very odd, it was working completely fine up until it didn't. I had no warning that it was going to stop working. It just suddenly doesn't. I rebooted my computer, unplugged and re-plugged in the mouse, and tried my best to clean out the mouse, but since it's sealed I don't think I did a very good job.For the price, I'd say it's a good mouse. For the sudden way it stopped working, I'd say keep a backup available.(fortunately I keep one for this very reason though the scroll wheel is finicky, but it's of a completely different brand.)I honestly liked this mouse and will probably order a new one, but if the same thing happens again I don't believe I will be purchasing another.If I can get the mouse working again, while I'll still order a new one, I'll come back and edit this review to say so.Edit: the new one arrived, when I plugged it in I noticed the profiles didn't save on the computer but seems to be linked to the mouse itself, I decided to plug in the old mouse to use the track pad on my laptop to save the profile on my computer, and suddenly it's working again. If it dies again, I'll edit this comment yet again but for the time being I'll be using the old mouse it looks like with a new one as a backup.Edit 2: Old mouse did it again only a few hours later. New one is out and will be used from here on out.

    The mouse feels good and robust. The software allows you to set up macros which is great, and you can control the mouse well enough even without the thumb, which makes using the buttons on the side easier.I have two relatively minor issues with it, which is that 1, the software distributed for the company appears to be different for each mice they sell instead of a single one that can recognize and manage all of them, which is weird but not that much of a big deal up to the moment you'll have to replace it with a better version, meaning you'll also need to uninstall the current software to install the new one. Really not that big a deal, just a bit annoying.The slightly bigger problem I found is that it doesn't work with my ergonomic mouse pad, which had me thinking the mouse was defective for a few minutes. I love that mouse pad, it's very comfortable and it worked with every mouse I've owned, even those that didn't work on my table, so this is extremely confusing... Probably means I won't be able to take my mouse with me, which is fine, the previous one still works and is lighter, but I'd rather not run my mouse on my table. Gonna need to go find one... So, if you have a soft ergonomic pad like those found in Best Buy or even here on Amazon, beware; chances are the mouse might not work on it.

    TL:DR, AMAZING warranty service. No B.S. 2 years is the minimum that you'll have a mouse for, unless you void the warranty.So, got this in April, had to return it shortly after because the wire was faulty and would disconnect with little movement. No fuss, only required an image of the bottom plate (which has not worn down in 9 months of daily use since)9 months later, and the wire has failed again. After a wonderful discussion with Kiara, where she explained why they did not stock the stiffer wire anymore, she has upgraded me to the wireless version. 11/10 customer service, above and beyond.You MAY also encounter a separate issue where the mouse may disconnect randomly, even without movement; there are two issues that could cause this.One: the software (not required, onboard memory, only required for initial setup.) doesn't always install right, perhaps? opening/reinstalling the software can fix this.Two: for whatever reason, it may not work well off of USB hubs: with the Redragon keyboard connected as well, they started failing twice as often. I took them off the hub, no further issues.

    Good product for the price.  A little bulky and heavier than the Razer Naga, but also about 1/2 the price

    This mouse is awesome. It is so comfortable and works great. I use it in Linux and configure it via a VM. The ergonomics are fantastic... The feel of the buttons, the scroll wheel is SOOO nice, the extra button next to left click, the thumb buttons... Gamer's paradise. Highly recommended.

    Coming from the Razer Naga line (multi-click issues with every single one), I think I have found a mouse that I can consider my new standard for gaming.If you’re also coming from Razer, this mouse feels a little bigger in your hand and it will take a little while to learn the num pad again. But it is totally worth it.I had an issue where the first one I bought was occasionally losing power and not working. Customer service could not be more stellar. I didn’t have to jump through any hoops before they decided to send me a replacement FAST.You don’t need to break the bank for a great mouse. Take the leap and buy this one! You won’t regret it.

    It works out of the box, but you have to download a program to set the buttons to do anything cool...

    I got this mouse for work. I’ve always loved MMO mouses because you can program each button as you please.I use it for 8 hours a day and it is super comfortable to the hand.
