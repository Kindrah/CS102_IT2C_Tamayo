    I got this in a rush when I needed a new headset. In hindsight a bit more research would have had me getting something else. As a precursor to the review I feel that it is worth noting that I am very rough on audio peripherals. I don't know why, but they usually last me about 6 months regardless of the quality and price. This is why I choose to buy at a cheaper price point more frequently rather than high-end less frequently.Pros:Price for the quality is greatDecent speaker/mic soundGood quality cable that is at least 6' longSits comfortably on the headStereo/mic to separate stereo and mic connector includedIn-line mic mute switch and audio volume adjustmentCons:The USB is only a power source for the blue lights on the headset (it is a bit misleading in its uses, but if I had researched it a bit more I would have found this out before purchase)The in-line mute and volume knob would be better with a mic gain knob as wellIt tends to make my head a bit sweaty (I have long hair and live in South Texas, US. So it is hard to find headsets that don't do that, but still something to keep in mind)The headset only goes on one way (The traditional right and left side is enforced by the mic only being usable one way. I know I am in the minority, but I like the mic being on the right side of my head)So this is absolutely worth the money, but if you are looking for a high-end headset this is not it. I know my cons were a bit nit picky, and I don't want anyone to think that I regret this purchase. I knew I was getting a quick solution to needing a headset, and I honestly got more than I was looking for. The USB lighting, while completely useless, is a cool addition. The only reason it didn't make it into the pros section is because unless you want to look cool on stream it is wasted resources.So, yea. If you want a good quality headset for a good price this is great for you.

    Very affordable. My 14-year-old son is hard on headphones. I decided to purchase these because the price was right for each of us. He uses his headphones for gaming and I use mine to drown him out while he is gaming. I like to listen to music and it is nice to have a mic that doesn't crackle. Very well made. Pleased with my purchase.

    I've been using the G9000 headset for a few months now, and it's a solid choice for any gamer and works great for online meetings. First off, the sound quality is on point ‚Äì I can hear every game detail, which ups my gaming experience. The bass surround is like being in the game! The mic is clear, and my friends hear me without any issues. It's also got this cool LED light that adds some style to my gaming setup. The only small downside is the plastic housing feels a bit cheap, but hey, it's a great deal for the price. In a nutshell, the G9000 is a winner for me.

    I was initially going to leave a negative review since the product was advertised as being compatible for pcs and I did not see a port for the microphone on the cord, however upon thorough inspection of the packaging, I found the corresponding port adapter for the microphone and audio for my pc. The sound quality is amazing for the value, and I've gotten many compliments for the microphone being ""youtube quality."" The mute and unmute slide button is a bit annoying, though. It seems to get stuck easily when I slide between on/off but it's not that big of an issue to me since most apps already have a built-in mute button. I also like that I can use this headset on other devices and not just my pc. The glowing light adds a nice touch.

    Decent headset, good microphone.  Didn't have any issues plugging it in, easy set up.The headset does stretch a bit, but doesn't recoil back, so if you stretch expect it to stay that way.The blue light is bright and continued to stay on after the computer was off.  I couldn't even get my phone charged when this computer is off, but the headset milks that energy.  The blue light is bright and will glow in a dark room, so cover it if you like darkness, but if you need a night light, it can fulfill that purpose.Cable twisted up too much.  Eventually, it led to the right ear set wavering off and on depending on how the wires lie.  So, it broke.  Lasted 33 months in total, need a new headset.  Hope this helps

    These are ok. I brought these because I thought I could separate game audio from game chat. No it cant be done. Secondly the cord has too much going on. The charging cord and the cord that plugs into the controller are connected together. Too much. You should be able to separate the two. Not to compare but I have another headset that the only cord used when playing is the one that plugs into the controller. Thirdly no a huge issue but I thought that the light stays on when gaming, it doesn't. Overall not a bad product just needs to polish up a few things.

    I bought this product specifically to use when using my PlayStation 5. I thought you charged the headset and the blue light could be turned on or off. That is not the case. You must plug in the USB somewhere to power up the light. Another thing is that the end of the headset chord has the jack connector and the USB connector separated in a y-split way. That means your jack connection and USB connection has to be really close to each other or you won't be able to use one of them as I can't on my PS5. The distance between the USB connector in the Playstation console and the jack connector which is in the controller is far apart and does not reach. I'll keep the headphones because everything else works fine and I'll use them when I play on my gaming computer. If this is not a conflict for your intended use then the headphones are pretty awesome and you'll be happy with them.

    After about 3 months of light use the 3.5mm splitter that connects the mic started coming undone repeatedly. I had to tape it together with Gorilla Tape. Not a huge deal to fix it, but it shows the quality of the product to say the least. The noise cancellation could also be improved. The sound quality and microphone are great for the price.**update** The seller reached out about the adapter issue and made it right. Excellent customer support!

    I've had this headset since November of 2023. It no longer works. I take care of my electronics so I know it's not me. The mic hasn't worked since December of 2023. Most of the time it wouldn't plug in to my controller. Poorly made!! It's not worth the money. Find something WAAAAAAY BETTERThat was my original review, above. I wish to change my review, thanks to the seller. They contacted me and offered a full refund. In my eyes, that's a generous human being. I had already used the headset for a few months. Electronics fail. The fact the seller gave me my money back was an amazing gesture

    The headset is great its light weight, and perfect for gaming.  The only thing is I wish I could get more volume out of the headset.  Outside of the volume its a great buy.

    Everything is great, sound is exceptional if your not using it at full volume. Only problem is that it is a is uncomfortable, it doesn't grip very well and could fall if you move too much. Furthermore after wearing it for a while your ears could hurt a bit but it isn't a big deal.

    My son goes through headsets like crazy. Usually they only last like 6 months to a year at best before the connectors start to go out and the headset needs replaced.Normally I get him the extended warranty on headsets but recently I must not have added it like I thought I did. When it went out I needed to get a new set and it happened to see an ad for this one online. I was skeptical given the low price and no name brand. But I figured it isn‚Äôt a huge loss of they were no good.I picked them up and let him try them. It only been a couple of weeks but he says the sound quality is comparable to other headsets he has had from turtle beach and Astro. He does think they look cooler too.All that being said, the real problem with headsets is longevity. I can‚Äôt speak to the longevity of these but the sound quality and look of them seems adequate. For now I‚Äôll give 4 stars and can update later if they last longer or shorter time than expected.

He says he like the sound quality for his games and the microphone seems to work okay. No one has had issues hearing or understanding him. Good price for me, good headset for him!

    After using it for several months, the sound of the left channel occasionally becomes smaller. I confirmed that this is not caused by poor contact. After adjusting the sound adjustment button, I can hear some noise and then it will return to normal.

    Bought this due to needing something on the less expensive end to play Fortnite with my son on PS4.  These have exceeded my expectations.

    I love these headphones but after a while they do get uncomfortable so I switch back to just simple in ear buds, maybe my head is too big for these but also I don't really feel like they noise cancel as well/much unless you turn it up all the way. I must say I never plugged in the lights so I can't tell you about that. Overall I would for sure buy these again especially for the price but if I was someone who gamed for hours on end everyday I would maybe invest in better ones, but then again it could be my big head...

    I have been using these almost 2 years before rating.They are comfortable and still work like new. I wish the microphone could bend towards me but it's only up and down. I will probably heat up the microphone bar and bend it closer to my mouth. I have to speak loud for gamers to hear me now.The volume doesn't get loud enough to hear people in my party even though on my S Series I have them max volume.I can hear them but I'd like it louder.The biggest problem is the usb A , to light the headphones up, and headphone jack are connected by a plastic block that prevent you from being able to light them up. See picture above.  So when I'm using these headphones plugged into my controller I can't light them up unless I use a battery bank. Non of my controllers have a USB A built in.
