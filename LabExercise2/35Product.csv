    This chair is amazing! Exactly what I hoped it would be and looks great with my setup. I’m 5’7” and 150lbs and it’s very roomy and comfortable which is exactly what I wanted! I’m using it as a gaming chair and it’s awesome to have somewhere to put my feet. If I put the footrest out but pushed all the way in I can even sit cross legged on this chair. The recline works perfectly and it was super easy to build. The whole chair feels incredibly high quality. Based on other reviews I was a little worried about it fitting under my desk but it does with no problem. On the lowest setting there’s around 1in clearance between the arms and the bottom of my desk which is more than enough given the arms are high and I like to sit higher up at my desk. My feet touch the floor but if you’re shorter they probably wouldn’t. They do offer a free shorter tube thing if you need it so I wouldn’t let that stop you from ordering!

    From the moment I clicked ""Purchase"" on the office chair through the provided link, I knew I was in for a treat, but I didn't realize just how much of a game changer this chair would be for my daily routine.Comfort is paramount in any office chair, and this one does not disappoint. The padding is plush and supportive, cradling the body perfectly throughout the workday. The adjustable lumbar support is a standout feature, providing the much-needed back support that's so important for someone like me who spends hours at a desk.But let's talk about the feature that I absolutely adore – the pull-out footrest. It's an absolute revelation! Whether taking a quick break to recharge or settling in for a more extended period of concentration, being able to kick back and elevate my feet is a luxury I didn't know I needed. It tucks away neatly when not in use, maintaining the chair's sleek appearance. The materials feel durable, and the mechanisms, like the height adjustment and tilt lock, operate smoothly and intuitively.To those considering an office chair, look no further. Whether you're typing away at reports, managing online meetings, or simply enjoying a moment of quiet contemplation, this chair, with its superb lower back support and pull-out footrest, will support you (quite literally) every step of the way.

    I love the ergonomic design of the chair and the aesthetic looks - color and style. The chair fits comfortably in my workspace. It arrived quickly and included cleaning pads for the white leather. A large headrest and extended leg and footrest make the chair extremely comfortable for short and extended sitting. Assembly was easy. Product parts are sturdy and of a good quality. There is also a product registration and one year warranty included with purchase. I’m thinking about upgrading other office furniture to match the chair.

    I am 210 lbs and 6 ft tall. I am sitting at my desk 12 - 13 hours a day and have worn several other (cheaper) chairs within a year or so, which have become very uncomfortable and impossible to sit in for long times. I was looking for a more durable and longer lasting solution so I opted for a higher weight rating chair. I was way out of line with that. This chair is huge. At the highest setting my feet barely reach the ground. The arm rest is adjustable in and out (very nice feature) but even at the tightest setting I barely can place my elbows on the arm rests, they are way too far apart for me. The rocking back and fort is awesome. Sitting is comfortable and it has a huge and tall back side. I would suggest if you are less than 300 lbs and, say, shorter than 6'3"" this chair will be too large for you to call it comfortable. Otherwise I love it. The chair is of good quality

    I have had it about A week & A 1/2 and really enjoy it. I'm 72 years old and it was very easy to assemble, in fact I didn't need any help at all. Not even to un-box it. It's very comfortable and fits my home office with the other furnishings really well. This chair is built very good from the steel (chrome plated ) pedestal to the upholstery fine stitching. Another fine feature is the flap on the rear that covers the screws for the backrest. Easy to access with the vel-cro flap. So comfortable, It's hard to get me out of my office, but sometimes will wheel it out to watch TV. GREAT PURCHASE, AND WELL DESIGNED !!

    UPDATE 5:The seller responded and AGAIN refused to honor their advertised free gas cylinder replacement, even though the original they provided failed within 3 months.Their excuse was that we were past the return window. The problem with that excuse is that we contacted them well within that window with a replacement request, and they repeatedly pretended not to understand the request, then to reject it. So they're stalling customers until they can say you aren't eligible for anything anymore.Also, if you read reviews, you'll notice a ""warranty department"" is mentioned, and that's who supposedly sends out the replacement parts they advertised. This apparently doesn't exist. Strongly suspect there might be some fake reviews in here given the way the company uses false advertisements and a complete lack of support. Will be reporting them to Amazon today. You should note, they seem to have removed the image that offered the free wheel replacements (though I believe I still have a screenshot for that report I'll file). But they do still mention free gas cylinder replacements in the original is too high (which is what I originally requested).I've now had to spend more money on replacement wheels because the seller lied about offering free replacements (the rubber ones safe for hardwood floors). And now I'll have to buy another cylinder for it. 100% not letting this go. I'm so tired of companies selling furniture items here with false advertising, knowing it's too difficult for most customers to return those items.UPDATE 4:Exactly 3 months from the day we ordered this chair, and after refusing to honor their advertised offer for a lower replacement cylinder, the original gas cylinder for this chair failed.No one using it uses it roughly. No one using it even comes close to the advertised weight limit. It was just being used in a stable position and suddenly failed. We reset it, and it failed again within minutes, making the chair unusable for us.I'm going to contact the seller one more time and insist on a replacement cylinder given they outright advertise they provide one, but if they refuse again, I'll be taking it up with Amazon, because this combination of quality issues and poor support is not acceptable.UPDATE 3:I definitely cannot recommend this chair. After weeks of use (with the wrong wheels and gas cylinder size because the company refused to honor their offer to send replacements), this chair causes a lot of pain. Lower back pain in particular is really bad. I suspect it's due to the combination of the very hard seat (disappointing given I looked for a spring-based seat intentionally -- if they're there, they're too small to be of any use as you still feel like you're sitting on a hard board) and the lack of lumbar support. Despite their description, there is basically NO lumbar support with this chair. It's incredibly painful even after minor use. I may even have to go back to the old chair this was replacing as the entire point was to reduce pain and increase comfort, of which this chair does neither. It's poorly made. It feels very unbalanced if you lean at all (especially with the lack of proper tension to prevent you falling backwards all the way). Way too many cracking and creaking sounds for a chair this new being used well below its advertised weight limit. Not supported at all by the seller (other than offering minor refunds to keep the junk and figure out how to dispose of it yourself at a loss). Just overall feels unsafe, uncomfortable, and I can't trust either the chair or the seller.UPDATE 2:After several back-and-forth messages with the seller here on Amazon, they've repeatedly ignored requests for the free replacement wheels (needed if you use it on hardwood floors) and the free replacement gas cylinder (if the original is too high) that are advertised on this page in the product images. After ignoring the request repeatedly, along with any tips on getting the tension to actually provide... tension... they flat out refused to honor their advertised offer for those replacement parts.All they did was offer a very small refund if we're willing to keep the chair... without the wheels needed for our floors... without the appropriately-sized canister... and without any reasonable tension function to lean back safely (forget ""rocking"" as noted in the description because this chair can't do that). It would cost us more to buy our own wheels and canister than what they offered, and that still doesn't address the false advertising of this being a rocking office chair or the unsafe lack of tension for the recline function.I would absolutely never do business with this company again, and we'll be contacting Amazon to see what can be done about them refusing to honor what they advertised. Extremely disappointed after a very long search for a replacement chair.UPDATE:This page, in the images, says the company will provide free replacement rubber casters / wheels if needed (which you need for hard floors), and a free lower replacement gas cylinder if the chair is too high (which it is for my wife).After asking them to send these multiple times via Amazon's messaging system, they've so far refused to do so (will update if they sort this out soon). They've also responded to questions about fixing the lack of tension and the misrepresentation about this being a ""rocking"" chair (it's definitely not; just reclining), and all we ever seem to get is a copy/paste response offering a small partial refund if we agree to keep the chair. We keep trying to tell them we're hoping to keep the chair, but we needed info on getting the tension to increase and we need the replacement parts they offered to make it work. But they've mostly ignored specific questions and just keep saying the same things. Until the last message where they said they couldn't send replacements for the ""missing parts,"" even though we never said anything was missing. We're just requesting the parts they offer to send right in their Amazon description. Not happy with support at all so far.--ORIGINAL REVIEWI have mixed feelings on this chair. First, it feels like a sturdy build. And if you're on the larger side, the cushion offers plenty of support -- firm, but mostly comfortable.The exception to the seat's comfort is that the front edge is very firm, and it can cut into the back of your thighs, negatively impacting circulation. This was the problem with my old chair and why I was replacing it. Normally I prefer a higher chair, but this is causing issues even at its lowest setting. The seller does mention in the images they'll send a lower cylinder if necessary, so if I keep the chair and receive that, I'll update on how that affects the pain at the front of the seat.The seller also offers to send replacement wheels if you need the rollerblade-style kind for hard floors. The plastic ones are extremely loud and totally inappropriate for hard floors and their protective mats, so it's nice they provide this option. But if you know you'll need them, I'd request them early. Otherwise you won't be able to fully assemble things until they arrive, or you'll have to risk damage to your floors using the defaults until the replacements can be swapped in.While I like the sturdy sense I get from the chair, there are two big problems for me. I've contacted the seller hoping I'm just not figuring out the settings properly, but I'll update if appropriate later.1. The description advertises this as a ""rocking"" office chair. With office chairs, that means something very specific -- the back and seat move in unison in a true rocking action. This looks like the seat can angle back a bit based on the video, but it doesn't seem to do that when ""rocking."" All it does is lean the top back. That's not a rocking office chair, which was an absolute requirement in me choosing this as a replacement for my old chair. Again, I'm hoping I just missed a control or something and that this will work as-advertised. Oddly though, when the foot rest is out, the seat itself does seem to recline back, so it clearly *can.* It just won't rock otherwise? And if you have heavier legs, or longer ones like I do, the leg rest isn't really usable because your center of gravity will get thrown off (and that's the one thing that doesn't seem sturdy in general). So, for a chair advertised for bigger users, are we simply not ""allowed"" to use the rocking function because it's tied to the leg rest??2. I'm also having issues with the tension knob. All the way in one direction and the back of the chair practically falls backwards the moment you touch it. All the way in the other direction and there's barely any more tension that that. It leads to a very insecure feeling unless you lock the ""rocking"" function, which again was a major deciding factor in choosing this chair. I'm hoping I'm missing something here too because I've never seen an office chair with this lack of tension.Other than that, the back is comfortable, and I like that the arms are adjustable (width during installation, and height while in-use).Aside from the rocking and tension, two things would make this chair near-perfect though:1. Adjustable lumbar support. Fixed lumbar support is all but useless in an executive chair because if you're sitting properly you're not going to be leaning back all the time. Proper lumbar support doesn't require you to recline back. It should help you stay upright and maintain your posture.2. I agree with another reviewer who was disappointed in the lack of head rest. For all the padding on the back of this chair (which is soft, yet dense enough it feels like it will hold up for quite a while), there's no real head rest. The head area is relatively flat and sits too far back, so your head won't even touch it unless you're lying back in more of a reclined position.The only other comment I'll make for now is that any reclining is pretty loud. There's a surprising amount of squeaking and creaking for a new chair. If I keep it, I might see if something needs to be greased. But if not, just know that could be an issue if that sort of noise bothers you.Oh, and like another reviewer, my box also arrived quite damaged. The entire bottom was split open. At first we were afraid we received a used chair after ordering a new one, but the internal pieces seemed OK and everything was there. But if multiple people are receiving damaged, open boxes, I'd make sure you have somewhere sheltered for this to be delivered. Had this been left by our garage in the rain (as many larger packages are here), the chair would have been ruined before we even opened it.

    The chair was easy to assemble but some mechanical skills are helpful- how to use an allen key and how to tighten a couple of bolts. If you have a 12mm wrench at home and perhaps a 5mm hex socket it will be much faster. If not, the included tools work fine.I've used this for a couple of months now; I am working from home 50% with some 8-10 hours in the chair daily.It is very comfortable for me and the material feels nice. Good quality. I am 6ft2 tall and on the highest setting it is just right to keep my knees at 90 degrees. The armrests are adjustable in height, and by adjusting the bolts the width can also be adjusted. The angle of the seat can not be adjusted. Just the height.I bought an additional headrest/pillow on Amazon (see second picture) which fits perfectly and helps to keep my spine straight. Without the pillow my head is either 'free floating' (no rest) or leaned back. This might be ok for most people but I find the addition of the pillow made this chair even better.Support and customer service is very good. After a couple of months (outside the return window) I noticed that the chair seemed to be always tilted to one side but it changed as I turned it. I found that the base of the chair (the star-shaped metal part at the bottom where the rollers attach) was likely to blame because it was slightly uneven.I contacted the seller and they very quickly, within a week, sent me a replacement part free of charge no questions asked. Now it's perfect!I would recommend this chair.

    It’s a great chair honestly, but I bought it because I’m a bigger size girl and work from home so I’m in my chair a lot. Unfortunately it doesn’t have many settings for where you want the back to be set. Actually, there’s only two…one for straight and the other is if you want to rock back and forth. The only thing is, I need my chair to be straight for my posture and anytime I lean back hard it doesn’t stay put and it’ll back up further which can be annoying for me. It’s a super comfy chair and I sit on it for 8 hours a day, sometimes more. I just wish the back stayed in place. Good thing is that it was easy to assemble.

    As a WFH professional spending long hours at my desk, I needed a chair that offered both comfort and durability. This chair delivers on the comfort front, with its plush cushioning and ergonomic design. However, I found it to be a bit oversized for my frame, which unfortunately led to some discomfort and back pain after extended use.Thankfully, the customer service team went above and beyond to assist me. Their prompt and attentive support helped me find solutions to adjust the chair to better suit my needs. While it required some extra effort on my part, the end result was worth it.Overall, while the chair may not have been a perfect fit initially, the exceptional customer service made all the difference. If you're willing to put in a little extra work to customize it to your liking, it's definitely worth considering for your home office setup.

    I recently purchased theExcebet office chair with mesh black material, and I couldn't be happier with my decision! If you are needing a new office chair, I promise this is the one you want! The seat is incredibly comfortable, providing ample support throughout LONG workdays without sacrificing breathability thanks to the mesh material.Moreover, I was pleasantly surprised by the exceptional customer service I received. I'm short (5'4) so even on the shortest setting the chair was a bit too high for me. I reached out to Excebet and they sent me a replacement cylinder right away!The representatives were not only helpful but also genuinely kind, ensuring that I'm 100% happy with my new office chair!Overall, I highly recommend the Excebet office chair for its comfort, durability, and outstanding customer service. It's a win-win for anyone looking to upgrade their workspace with comfort, style and functionality.

    I mean, its a 300 dollar chair. I think we all have the same expectation; better be a damn nice chair for 300 dollars.I work from home and have no kids. I also am a renter, and spend some of my free time in the same chair for TV shows, movies, and general entertainment.Its easy to put together, everything fits in a way that feels sturdy, none of the screws or bolts or anything felt chincy or stripped out the threads during assembly. Everything works well and feels sturdy that's the key.You never know what you're going to get when you order online, but ive been using this chair for maybe 12-16 hours a day for the past 7 or 8 days though and this seems like a great purchase.

    I bought this chair on an Hope and a Prayer.  You never know what to expect these  days.  I wanted something nicer than what I had...  and heck yeah, I got it.  Big heavy box with lots of protective wrapping that ultimately revealed some very thick meatal parts and very fine fabric.  As mentioned before, very easy to assemble.  And then done.  You have simply the best chair you ever owened.  My Adult children sat on it and immediately declared the it was the ""best chair they ever sat on"".  So I bought one for each of them.  My son is 6 feet tall, I am 5'9"", and the dawwter is 5'7"".  The chair is the perfect fit for everyone.  Everyone is happy.

    Not going to lie, was a tad shocked at the height of the chair but after we built it, which was pretty simple, I sat in it and immediately fell in love with this chair. I work from home and was looking for a chair that would provide good back support and a solid butt cushion and this thing delivers! The back is very soft and gave my lower back the support it needs while being stiff enough to create a great sitting experience while I work. I love that the reclining option can be controlled and it even has a foot rest! I literally told my coworker I could take a nap in this thing lol! To top it off the customer service I reasoned is impeccable! Even my husband was impressed as well as my son after sitting in it. I highly recommend this chair and the company!

    I took about an hour to assemble by myself. Compressing the back cushion against the seat cushion to install screws that hold back to seat was hardest part of project. Otherwise reasonably easy assembly. Providing a few extra screws and washers, just in case, was a nice touch.I've only sat in it a few minutes so far. Comfort is okay, not great. Too many smallish cushions in lumbar area are very mildly uncomfortable. Easily cured with thin pillow over lumbar area to even out all the bumps. And, as others have commented, headrest is set too far back to be at all useful. I suppose I could wrap some sort of additional cushion on top of existing headrest to bring it further forward. But these sort of ergonomic adjustments shouldn't be necessary these days. The issues are just too obvious to anyone who has sat in the chair for even a few seconds.Biggest complaint is that I ordered ""Light Brown"". I received ""Beige"". By beige, I mean band-aid flesh tone; far from my favorite color. I think I have seen similar complaint from at least one other reviewer. I don't know who has responsibility for picking products from the warehouse. But someone tends to be a little careless. Given what I've heard about Amazon warehouse working conditions, I'm certainly not going to pursue the point. And I'm not concerned enough personally to go through the hassle of disassembling and returning for an exchange.This chair is too ugly to use for formal office meetings. I guess it will become a knock-around utility chair.  Remains to be seen how well this chair holds up after months or years of use. BTW, fresh out of the box, this upholstery smells like plastic, some version of vinyl I think. It's not overwhelming but definitely there. Hopefully, smell will go away eventually.

I’ve had this chair almost a month now, and it’s sturdier and more comfortable than any other computer chair I’ve tried. I work from home and play games on my personal computer, so I spend a lot of time sitting at my desk. Other chairs would not feel supportive enough, or they would hurt my back or butt. This is the first chair I haven’t had an issue with and it was worth the price!While I don’t use it too often as I like to sit up straight while at work, the leg rest and recline of the chair are also very comfortable to use.Customer support even reached out to me to make sure I didn’t have any issues and offered me a free lumbar pillow. The pillow is seen in my second picture and is a great addition to the already very comfortable chair.Assembly was also pretty pain free, I normally have to have my boyfriend put furniture together for me but this I was able to do mostly myself. There were a few parts two people were required for me to set parts straight and lift the chair as it is a little bit heavy.

    Needed to replace my expensive office chair that lasted 4 years but due to Working From Home basically wore it out (getting fatter didn't help...) I needed something that's comfortable for work duty and also for my hobby, spending many long hours making and painting military models, so, after extensive research I decided on this beauty, it had the looks and the reviews, and after years and years of black leather chairs, I was taken with the Light Brown color, in real life its was better than I thought it would be!Really easy to assemble (less than an hour!)Having gotten used to the benefits of Roller Wheels, I reached out to the seller to take advantage of their free Roller Wheels replacement, and the seller has been brilliant! wheels shipped in a very fast time, very impressed with their customer service! I highly recommend both the chair and the seller!

    The color is beautiful and it doesn’t have that weird chemical smell that some faux products have. Sturdy. Exactly what I was looking for.

    Big and comfy. It was easy to put together. Took about 30-40 minutes. Cushions feel plush. Seat is big, definitely for bigger people. It's kind of high. As a short person, my feet don't completely touch the ground. But I don't mind. So far, I'm very happy with this chair.

    This chair was worth every penny!! It is so comfortable and its also extremely easy to assemble, it took like 10 minutes. I really appreciate the fact the arms are also adjustable (can move them up and down) so I push this chair all the way into my desk which is a huge space saver especially if you dont have a desk that can up and down.The lumbar support and the rocking functionality is on point and I feel very relaxed being on it, almost like sleeping. I don't really have any complaints but I really wish it came with an additional pillow to support by neck or my lower back :)

    I’ve been researching chairs and prices for the last 30 days then I decided to go on Amazon and see if I can find the same chair for a cheaper price. Amazingly, I found most of the chairs I was looking for for half of the price of the major stores I found this chair online And buying a chair is kind of like buying a pair of shoes you don’t know how comfortable it’s gonna be or the quality until you see it but I give it a 10 out of 10 it’s a little firmer chair super easy to put together and for $299. Glad I made the investment , I would highly highly recommend this chair to someone who likes a comfortable chair

    I received my chair yesterday, two days before the estimated arrival date, and quickly assembled it by myself (I'm a 61 years old woman, mind you!), very easy, the instructions were pretty clear. I'm in love with it! I bought the white one, it's beautiful, high quality, super comfortable, it gives good support for my aching back, and it makes my home office look high tech and luxurious. I hope it lasts for many years!

True white; whiter than original description--which is what I was looking for. This is comfortable, goes back and locks into place, goes up and down and swivels. The seller offered a set of rubber wheels which are now on the chair (great customer service)! I was looking for a sturdy chair that would not wobble and this is it. It was easy to put together by myself, although it's advised to have another person help, I was able to complete this alone. There is a built-in lumbar support. I'm tall--5'9"" and also use a footrest under the desk. One of my better investments.

    I like that the chair reclines and the armrests adjust to your desired height. Sitting in for long hours is very comfortable with the ease of propping your feet up.

    Awesome chair very comfortable and high quality and well built! I do not use reclining function as I have a bad back so like that it locks in the any position of reclining or straight up position. I recommend this chair! Very happy with this chair!

    So far this chair already feels MUCH better than your average office chair. I'm a pretty big person so the wider seat is definitely welcome. The cushion is a bot firm, but nothing a seat cushion can't fix. Only time will tell just how much better this chair does, but so far so good!

    Just received it from Amazon this morning. Replacing my 18 mo. old AKRacing chair due to lift cylinder failure. The Excebet Desk Office Chair, Big and Tall arrived on time. The box was a bit beat up, but the packing prevented any damage. Fairly easy assembly which took approx. 40 mins. Much easier with a ratchet and allen socket. Included wrench would have taken forever. It should be noted I am older, have some movement issues and really took my time.  Upon trying it was “comfortable” but not great. Definitely not worth the original $499 price. Still debating about the $299 current discounted price. The pseudo leather is nice and cushioning is comfortable. The biggest issue is it has fixed lumbar support and side cushions that support the shoulders but does not have a head cushion. So, in essence, your lower back is pushed forward, your shoulders lean back and your head leans so far back against the head rest it is like sitting in a dentist chair. BUT I would rather have that than the overly large head pillows that push your head forward even when leaning back.The jury is still out. Not a clear winner or loser. I may just have to get used to it after the non supportive AKRacing chair which definitely was an over priced uncomfortable chair!

    Great chair for full support.  I can sit comfortably using the arm rests and lumbar support for when I’m working.  Then when I need a recovery break I just pull out and foot rest and lean back.  The chair holds my neck great and softly if I lean back and it can deal with me being tall.  Love the chair so far and would recommend.

    The shipment arrived heavily damage, had I been home when arrived, I would not have accepted it.  Once I open the box I notice one of the arms on the base was pressed into the chair back. The chair back was protected by a plastic bag and had no damage, just needed to massage a little. Two of the arms on the base had scratches.  The arms are heavily wrapped  in cardboard and bubble wrap and this wrapping was not damaged, so the scratching must have been done before packing..... thus the large discount 499 to 299. This is my opinion. After assembling,  the scratches aren't noticeable.  Now the positive: For me the chair was easy to assemble, all of the hardware was in place and extra hardware is given and all parts where there, the chair fucntions very well as it should and it is very very comfortable. I purchased it for my wife's home office and she loves it, guess thats all the matters. Nice chair. Hope this helps others
