    Having grown up on the NES and SNES, I was happy to see an entirely new 2D entry in the mainline mario series. After the phenomenal Super Mario Odyssey easily became my family's favorite video game during the pandemic, we were somewhat disappointed with the remakes that have been released since. It was an easy choice to pre-order Super Mario Wonder, but I was doubtful the experience could compare to Odyssey, despite more emphasis on co-op play.Gameplay:From the start screen, the essence of Mario games is captured perfectly in Super Mario Wonder. Levels oscillate between familiar terrains and novel landscapes. Most mario games offer something new that at first seems like it will disrupt the always-solid platforming experience and genius level design hallmark to 2D mario adventures. Wonder includes several new power-ups, an overwhelming number of one-at-a-time badges provide a small change in-stage, and the wonder flower induces brief level-warping or mario-warping mini-challenges. None of these are affect the game on the level of Oydssey's Cappy or Mario Sunshine's FLUDD. However, they are all interesting and worthy additions. They also allow for a solo base difficulty that is decidedly more challenging (as you get further into the game) than many other 2D Mario games. Yet, the game (as you would expect) is adaptive to a wide range of player skill because of the co-op, invincible characters (that don't need to be unlocked), new power-ups, and badges. Still, I do miss the simplicity of the platforming challenges hallmark to Mario games, which aren't quite as much on display here as compared to collecting star coins in New Super Mario Bros.Graphics:Graphically, the game delivers as much as the hardware allows. Detailed environments and distinct aesthetics for each world are evident. It can be a bit busy, but always fun. The level of polish is as good as any Mario game, which already sets the bar high. Character animations, character model design, enemy design, and effects, all add greatly to the experience.Controls:The controls, for the most part, are what you'd expect from a Mario title: reliable. Yet, during some platforming, my kids experienced issues they blamed on lagging response. It could have been that they were sitting too far from the Switch or that they are kids. I didn't notice any issues with input lag or imprecision. I also love that Nintendo just 2 core (run and jump) buttons are needed most of the time, supplementing with the top-right bumper button (or, alternatively, shaking the control) on occasion.Co-op:The co-op mode is where ""Super Mario Wonder"" truly attempts to bridge the generational gap. Collaborating with my children, combining our abilities to face challenges, is a great way to spend time together. The characters that don't receive damage from enemies make it easy for novices to contribute to the progress and keep up with more advanced players.Overall Assessment:Super Mario Wonder delivers on combining many of the most beloved and nostalgiac components of former 2D Mario adventures while avoiding the trap of feeling like an updated version of a previous game. My kids enjoyed the new features more than I did, with my 8-year old laughing hysterically every time I hop along as a crouched elephant Mario. I'll update as we continue our adventure...

    The Super Mario Bros.™ Wonder brings a wave of nostalgia, making it a must-have for fans of the iconic Nintendo franchise. From the charming characters to the vibrant graphics, this game encapsulates the magic that made Mario a household name.The gameplay is engaging, with clever level design and a delightful mix of classic elements and innovative twists. The controls are responsive, providing a seamless experience for players of all skill levels. The inclusion of various power-ups and surprises adds an extra layer of excitement, keeping the adventure fresh and entertaining.However, one aspect that could be improved is the soundtrack. While the familiar tunes are there, the overall audio quality doesn't quite match the brilliance of the visuals. Some tracks sound a bit tinny, and for those who hold the original game's music close to their hearts, this might be a bit disappointing.Despite this minor audio hiccup, Super Mario Bros.™ Wonder is a joyous journey into the Mushroom Kingdom that will captivate both longtime fans and new players alike. It's a delightful addition to any gaming collection, offering a charming blend of classic and contemporary Mario magic.

    Mario has always been present in my life. My first serious interactions that my memory recalls is from Super Smash Bros Melee, he was the headliner, the face of Nintendo, but I still would rather play as Link. I dabbled here and there with the 2D games often getting too frustrated with them and not feeling enough of a hook to continue with the harder levels, let alone beat the whole game.My first Mario game that I really played through and throughly enjoyed was Mario Odyssey. A great 3D plat-former. I wouldn’t put it up there with my all time favorites but I had a great time with it.When Nintendo revealed Super Mario Bros Wonder back a few months ago, I shrugged it off and made no plans to play it (I was salty about the lack of a Wind Waker port announcement being made on Switch and still am). But I had been hearing some buzz about it and thought I’d pick it up as a birthday gift to myself sense I hadn’t been playing any games as of late.All that to say, this game is simply wonderful. “Wonder” was the perfect title for this game. It had such a sense of joy, and glee about its creativity and is a celebration of what Mario is. You really get a sense of how much everyone who worked on this game really love what they do. They made something truly special.The gameplay is tight, responsive, challenging, and a blast to play. The level design is out of this world creative, second to none, can’t think of a game that has done it better, the graphics are gorgeous, and the music is perfect.I’m not the best at 2D platformers so I struggled with a few of the levels, and I can’t really compare the difficulty level with this and other Mario’s, but I’m going to have to go back and play some other 2D titles now.Overall, I highly recommend this game. It’s a joy to play and really brings back what games are supposed to be about: fun gameplay and a fun experience with none of the strings attached like the rest of the gaming landscape right now.10/10

    This game brings the 2D Mario games forward by incorporating things like NPCs and Events into the formula. I like the nonlinear and branching levels, and it is all very fun.The graphics are bright and cheery and the controls are responsive.

    I've been a fan of Nintendo since the original came out in the 80's. Had the original, Super, 64 and Wii, now I have Switch. I've played a lot of Mario games and by far this Mario game is the best. The graphics are awesome, I love the interaction. You can play with folks from around the world or with friends, however I choose to play by myself for now. It has a little bit of nostalgia feel to it as the worlds have a nice length to it and you are grabbing coins, old bad guys that now sing as well as try to kill you.  And then it's mixed with 2024 with playful interactions and new warp worlds that are fun and exciting to get through. You can also change characters to get a feel of what they each can do which is turn into an elephant all except the Yoshis. I haven't finished the game yet, I'm still exploring and going back into the worlds I've already finished to see if I missed anything. But this game is definitely worth it. You won't be disappointed.

    Fantastic game really. The new power ups, Elephant, Bubble and especially Drill, are delightful and I hope most make it into successive games (Elephant was a bit OP, but I’d love to continue seeing bubble and drill, especially in a fully 3D Mario). Lots of new challenges and secrets to find. A pseudo trophy system made it fun to “100%” the game (not super easy to do, but not the hardest either), the Switch needs a trophy system or some such implemented badly, a miniature version coming built into Mario just illustrates it all the more. The different characters were nice, but not as exciting as I’d hoped. I wished there were more differences between them and the fact that Yoshi and the … Rabbit? Were basically the easy setting (although at the cost of the power ups, does make them kinda boring) for the game was actually disappointing (I really wanted to play as Yellow Yoshi, but I didn’t want the handicap of not taking damage or basically never having issues making a jump. I’d rather an actual setting for that). While I was playing, I had tons of fun, but I have to say, the games true downside … it’s a full priced sidescroller. It’s great fun, but I won’t be indulging in that for myself again tbh. I’ll wait for the sales. There feels like 0 incentive to go back and replay anything. No multiplayer game modes (you can play multiplayer, but as far as I’m aware it doesn’t offer anything in the way of a party game), so I’m probably never going to touch it (and I’m an obsessive collector so I’m disinclined to sell). It didn’t take me too much actual play time, and much of that was replaying stages to 3 star, if all I’d cared about was the story (which was fun!) I woulda been done much sooner - that’s why the switch needs a trophy system, Nintendo’s own games would get more out of one than any of the third party, just doesn’t hold up to that price point the way recent Zelda or Mario Odyssey do. Not saying side scrollers aren’t fun, they’re a blast, we need them to stick around, but you just don’t get as much game for the money you pay and that should be addressed.

    Our family has been loving this game! Definitely easier and more fun than Mario 3D World for our younger kids. Feels a lot more like the Super Mario World from the 90s than Mario 3D World. The Power Ups are innovative and so fun!

    Another Mario game that hits it right out of the park and wins over another generation.  I absolutely loved playing this game as has my 19 year old son.  There is so much to be discovered and so many surprises.Nintendo brings the most attention to detail and so many little touches that old school Nintendo gamers like myself love to see.  From the 8 but nods and music to the 80's throw back rock music to all of the ""enemies"" brought back to life.Another absolutely enjoyable, nostalgic yet fresh game for everyone!

    I’ve been playing Nintendo for ages. Unfortunately as you get older, your reflexes slow down and sometimes some of the newer games are just too hard. This one was cute, fun and had lots of different kinds of levels.  Graphics were beautiful and smooth. Most importantly it was challenging but not so much that it was frustrating. Lots of little secrets to find. Even the credits were fun. I enjoyed this very much!

    So I have to say that I was almost disappointed months ago to learn that Nintendo was making another 2D Mario game. The first thought I had was why are they not making a Super Mario Odyssey II!? Which I’ve still not given up hope for. When I discovered it was going to be a 2D at this point the trailer had not been released so we didn’t know it was the Wonder version & just how phenomenal it was going to be. I was assuming it would be something similar to the Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe which I lost interest in. As soon as the trailer for Wonder was released I said to my husband I’m buying it. Pre ordering it right now. Just prior to seeing the trailer I had told him I wouldn’t be buying the new 2D game because I was that upset it wasn’t Odyssey II or any 3D Mario game. I’m so glad I decided to purchase this game. First I must mention that it was delivered to our door the SAME DAY the game was released. My husband & I played it immediately & were instantly obsessed!!!!!! This is the most beautiful Mario game to date. I love it equally as much as I do Super Mario Odyssey which is saying a lot. I wish it was just as long as Odyssey though. So I guess that would be my only complaint. While it’s definitely not a short game - I do wish it was longer because I love it that much. I just never want it to end. I’d say many of us are still hoping for an Odyssey II one of these days but this will definitely help in passing the time while the world waits for it!!! Get this game. You won’t be disappointed. 10/10

    This is not the US version game. Switch games are not locked to any specific region but to say this is a US version is false advertising. However, I’m able to play the game no problem so far. If you are ok saving $10 for a non-us version this is a good choice but, again, this is not a US version game

I find myself going through the levels slowly so I can see all the details and find all the secrets, and every stage is full of wonder!Online play is fantastic, I have a lot of fun helping other players find secrets or reviving them mid-stage if they're struggling. It's a very refreshing experience to have cooperative online play!

    the art style and the direction they took with animations makes this game pop. Mario Wonder has a different feel from  the ""New Super Mario Bros"" series. Mario Wonders stage select is like mario 3d world on the wii u. so a bit of nostalgia hit me. the sound track is also great, as always. with many playable characters. Daisy is back and finally in 2D. i hope to see more of her in the future. mario wonder has my hopes up for ""Princess Peach: Showtime!""

    After having read the reviews I was skeptical to say the least. However, the game is every bit as good as people say is (after beating the first major castle) the scenery is gorgeous, the game play is smooth and extremely reminiscent of the old Super Mario World for the NES. If you (like me) have been waiting for a true next step in the chapter from Super Mario World, this is it. This will bring a whole new generation into the fold of loving the classic, original, epic game play that is Super Mario. I rarely say this about any game, but, it’s a MUST PLAY for all ages.

    This is a fun game, and guess in very well with the Mario franchise. Can take a bit to get used to the new moves, but still a fun game.

    OK so I love this game, it brings a lot of new art and fun to the table. It does seem, at least to me, to be very easy, but at the same time it's possible I've just gotten way too good at Mario games. But this may mean no matter what skill level you have or don't, you will have a lot of fun and for some of you, you may have a bit of a challenge. I've yet to try multiplayer as I have no friends (JK) but I understand it's like the NSMB multiplayer except you can't throw your friends or bump into them, so I dunno. In Single player, you can play whatever character you want, so if you want to go through the whole game as a pretty Princess who turns into a Princess Elephant, you can do that. They have some easy mode players as well that don't die when hit by enemies, and if you use them, that can be our little secret. I also want to point out that this game is roughly the same size as my all time favorite, Mario 3, even though somehow it feels like I'm zipping through this game really fast compared to that one. I did the comparison so you didn't have to. There are a good number of regular levels + some bonus levels, like the one where you race a caterpillar for some reason. There's also some funky stuff that you may already know about, so I'll let you just discover all that on your own.
