    I recently purchased the SENSYNE 62"" Phone Tripod & Selfie Stick, and I love it!!. As a new and upcoming photographer. I was on the lookout for an affordable yet reliable selfie stick that I could take with me anywhere that was not too heavy, and this tripod/selfie stick combo has proven to be an excellent choice. I am very short and could never hold the phone and take pics at the same time. This extendable feature of the tripod allows me to capture shots from various angles and heights, providing versatility to my photography. The 62-inch height is particularly advantageous for group photos or capturing stunning landscapes. The ability to transform it into a selfie stick adds an extra layer of functionality, making it an all-in-one solution for my photography needs. I don't have to stretch to get the perfect picture anymoreOne of the standout features, that I like is the wireless remote, which adds convenience to my photo sessions. Being able to control the shutter remotely ensures that I can be a part of the frame without any hassle. The setup is incredibly user-friendly, making it perfect for someone like me who is just starting in the world of photography. I love the price and the look of this stick. Highly recommend it!Not only is the SENSYNE 62"" Phone Tripod & Selfie Stick cost-effective, but it also delivers on performance. It's an ideal companion for any aspiring photographer, offering a seamless blend of affordability, ease of use, and functionality. I highly recommend this product to fellow beginners or anyone in search of a reliable and budget-friendly tripod/selfie stick solution.

    I bought this for my 8 year old daughter she loves makes videos of herself dancing or doingGymnastics and she kept trying to find places and ways around the house where she can rest her phone in a way to record herself. This tripod is great. Very sturdy, light enough to carry around easy to take the phone off and on. High adjustment is great and the bonus is definite the Bluetooth remote. She can start her video or take a picture using the remote instead of having to walk up and away to start/stop her videos. Would definitely recommend.

    A year after purchase this stand gets used at least once a week and we've had no problems at all with it. The bright color makes it easy for the crew to see when we're doing hectic live sales online. Absolutely would recommend. Very sturdy, easy to use.

    It’s a very nice tripod. The only thing that I would recommend for it is that you add support for bulky phone cases I can’t take vertical, photos I have to take them horizontally.

    Super happy with this product for the price point. Strong enough to hold my phone in all different positions. Doesn’t easily tip, etc. Adjusts to be quite tall, and is super easy to set up/ use. Would recommend!

    So I’m writing a review about this part of this is my fault. The other part is product defect I purchased this a while back and I didn’t use it for about a month or so after I purchased it and on my first time using it, it worked great, but when I went to collapse it to put it away in the picture as you could see, the bottom part broke on me. The unfortunate part which is frustrating is that it’s a third-party not from Amazon but Amazon help me out still but the problem was I couldn’t exchange it because I was passed my time on it even though it was my first time using it frustrating but rules are rules but I’m just writing a review about it and that’s all yes I like it. Yes I will probably buy one more of these but I wanted to show what the product did on me the first time using it that’s all.

    I bought this because I’m eloping in Vegas in a month. I am trying to cut costs and all I really wanted was to be able to have footage of our ceremony. I have an iPhone so I was wary of the remote but it works!!! I’m super happy with this and if it ever breaks I will be buying another. This will be a total game changer for family pics, content creators, getting that perfect selfie or portrait angle, and whatever else you may need a tripod for! It feels pretty sturdy but I will update once we get home from our trip. It’ll be at a dry lake bed so I’m expecting it to be windy, we shall see how it holds up.03/04/24

    We really like these tripods! We’ve used them for our family photos, for recording videos and for recording games with friends. The only thing I don’t really like is the “selfie stick” part. I thought that it would come with a separate piece for a handle but you just collapse the tripod stand part and use that as the handle and we’ve pinched our hand a few times trying to use it, but we honestly don’t use that function that often anyway.

    This is a great tripod. I honestly only have one complaint and it’s the lack of motion where you connect your phone. It moves a decent amount, don’t get me wrong. But for what I was purchasing it for, there was no way to get the angle I wanted.So overall, it’s a really decent tripod. But if you want more downward tilt I would consider something else.

    I like the versatility of this product - can be held like a selfie stick, and also extends to make a very-portable tripod.  It's a good compromise if you need something to do both, especially for travel, if you don't need a super-grufty tripod or a super-light selfie stick.  Fits easily into a suitcase and can fit into/onto a backpack.I didn't notice that it comes with a Bluetooth remote, and haven't tried that yet, but it's a nice bonus.Customer service great!  The first unit actually had a looseness problem of the top support, and they quickly sent a replacement that took care of the problem.

    This thing is metal and sturdy! There's so many cheap plastic ones on the market, I'm so glad I finally upgraded. Super impressed.I'm also two inches over five feet and this thing is like a whole foot taller than me, so this is perfect for the tall baddies out there!

    So there are only specific angles you can set to point your phone camera up or down…so if you need just a little more down, you have to go about a quarter of an inch down…you can just lift the extensions up…but the extension heights have a lot of adjustments so you can really get a good height…I use this to video tape my terrible skateboarding skills to improve where I may be doing something wrong…before this I was just leaning my phone against a wall causing damage to my phone…this was a great idea that I can just quickly and effortlessly set this up and start recording.  Phone fits very nicely with just a little bit of room to snap the phone in place…wide legs to make sure it doesn’t tip over.  Very light and compact too…a great addition to my video set.  I would recommend.

    It’s decent. It’s a cheap, Chinese made tripod. Don’t expect anything great but it’ll hold your phone which is hopefully all you’re asking it to do. I bought it to snap photos from my phone, which I will probably use the timer as it’s not overly solid like a more expensive tripod. I don’t regret buying this and it’ll serve the purpose I bought it for.

    It is cool and comes with a remote. However it is flimsy and it doesn't angle down the way I wanted. I found out after I bought my husband actually has the same kind. So I returned it as I didn't need it

    I bought this so that we could take some DIY family photos when our baby was born. It worked amazingly for that! I also use it to take milestone pictures of our baby in front of a sheet as a background. The remote connects via bluetooth and is small enough that you can hold it in your hand while you take photos without seeing the remote. I am very impressed with this purchase!

    I've had a couple of stands before which broke after some usem so far this one has survived two, two week cruises and makes it so easy to get photos. Especially with the included remote. The stand is very sturdy and has a lot of range of motion to it.

    Like the product real well, but it got shipped with the hydraulic oil that i ordered too and the oil leaked out in the box and all over everything in the box and out on my porch where it was delivered. This product once I got all the oil off of it works great, just as the seller said it would.

    Very slim easy piece to transport and use. Our phones fit securely, remote does it job, zero complaints. Well, we've misplaced the remote a few times; suggest finding a way to secure to the tripod when packing away. We were going to use for a family reunion, then send back (don't judge you've done something similar I bet) but found it was too handy to sent back. Kids used for Christmas card pictures and we used for a crazy family video thing. Very happy with this buy.

    I love this stand I use to watch videos while doing chores, streaming or just holding my phone am even using it now, the grip at the base could of been slimmer for selfie use but it's great, the lock for the tripod leg stand doesn't actually lock when you twist it so it slowly slips down if in windy conditions.

    I was in the look for a tripod for my iphone 15 max pro. This one is perfect. It holds my phone really well not tilting like most others. I can have it standing on floor and using the entire 6ft extender and still not tilting, as my phone is kind of heavy. Recommend

    Remote works. Only has on or off, but what more would one want for the price? If I could change one thing, its that there would be something on the remote indicating indeed the video is turned on or off.  Excellent camera stand & remote & I'd recommend it to anyone.

    I might use this differently than most. I didn't need a selfie stick, I needed longer arms. For my job, I am often around machinery I need to get photos or videos of, but cannot get close to due to safety barriers or equipment placement. This stick allows me to reach with my phone further to get closer photos and videos of the equipment.

    Material is durable, almost full metal base (minus the hinges and more flexible spots required for movement), and metal body.The phone holder itself is secure and trustworthy, easily holding the phone at any angle I move it to, and gripping it strongly even if I attempt to tug on or pull the phone out without releasing the grip.

I have had several different types of phone stands. But this one truly takes the cake for one main reason…… how tall it gets!! Seriously it can go so so tall compared to other tripods. I love that you can make your phone go landscape or portrait. The bottom of the stand lays flat which I prefer because it’s harder to knock the tripod down.It is compact and small. It fits in the average size backpack. It does not fit in my smaller backpacks.The remote is small and has a hole for a key chain. It is responsive and has worked well for me personally.I like that I can turn it to pretty much any angle.It does come with a go pro attachment. I can’t review that because I do not have a go pro.

    The tripod looks well built but handling it like a selfie stick did not really feel like it would work for me, so I returned it.  The return process went smoothly.  My only test before returning was extending the tripod and setting my camera on the attachment to the tripod.  As a tripod, it appeared to work well but I wanted it more for a selfie stick.

    The materials look like they won't deform and will be sturdy for use in my classroom, to record lessons for online usage. The connectors are plastic, but that helps keep the weight of the entire tripod manageable with all the other things one must tote when setting up quick recordings.First delivery never made it to me,  I've been waiting 2 weeks including first order time period to use this! Thank you for quick re order.
