    Love it. I'm not good at asymbeling and this was super easy. Just do one step At a time and read the notes per step. Last gamer chair I had was a titan secret lab  and this was as comfy as that. The armbars don't move but that wasn't a problem for me.the footrest is just a easy sliding bar that doesn't really extend to far but still worked for me. The headrest is OK but is not luxury comfort. Having said all that for the money and ease of setup it's a great deal for under $200. The chair is really comfortable the recliner steadily stops at several recline positions. If you knew what you were doing 100 percent you could set this chair up I'm 10 minutes but with reading it's probably a 40 minute setup. When you connect the top to the bottom there is a slot at the bottom the top fits in so you can easily screw the screws in with one person. No extra tools required or needed. While it's not premium luxury it is a really really comfortable chair and even has a massager that uses USB. Its not super strong but it does a good job. Only complaint it's a little loud but not deafening. If your looking to spend under 200 and need a one person setup I highly recommend this chair! Delivery was also fast! It's a little intimidating when first opening but the directions were fairly easy to follow. Had a few extra screws in the end but I think they are just backups. Just buy it lol.

    Highly adjustable for seating and reclining preference. The chair and parts do not feel cheap or like it won't last long. The reclining feature has a lock to set it exactly where you want it. The bottom back pad has a vibrating feature which while not like a massage chair, feels nice to use. Too many gaming/computer chairs are way overpriced; for what you get, this chair is a solid purchase. May not fit larger legs or waist, (I'm 230lbs, 250lbs would be the upper limit for seat space between arm rests). On the stiff side, but with back and head cushion.

    I got this chair on sale for $110 (not counting shipping) which I recommend you do.Assembly: It took barely an hour to put together and could’ve honestly been quicker than that had I not been multitasking. It’s incredibly easy/simple to assemble, a child (of good enough strength to tighten the screws and lift the chair) could build this. Despite it’s simplistic construction is feels smooth and sturdy.Experience: initially, it felt cheap. The sides of the backing of the chair feel as though they are lined with pool noodles, which threw me off at first. I was worried the chair was going to be stiff or uncomfortable. However, I was pleasantly surprised! It’s very comfortable to sit in, and the telescoping arms and foot rest are incredibly appreciated. I will say the plastic of the arms feels on the cheaper side and they already seemed a little wobbly shortly after construction. This can likely be amended by tightening the screws. The lumbar support pillow sits a little low for me, so I wish it adjusted to an even higher point, but I will say I am rather curvy so that’s likely a me problem. The headrest pillow is very nice and the backrest reclines and locks well, doesn’t feel wobbly or like it’s going to tip backwards. The chair also sits very low which was wonderful since it fit under my bunk bed, *and* fit my legs comfortably under my desk, which is impressive since most others do not (I have thicker thighs).Summary: I think this chair is definitely one of the best on the market for the price point. It’s not exactly top of the market quality but that’s to be expected for only $110. I would expect slightly better quality if I were paying the full $200 for it, though. Recommended on sale, and especially for those on more of a budget. Exceeded expectation. 8/10

    It is exactly what we were looking for ! True to specifications, easy to follow instructions, and came with a few spare pieces of hardware just in case ! I think the purple is even prettier in person ! Very comfortable and sturdy.

    This is a fantastic gaming chair for the price! The seller shipped it promptly after I ordered ,and when I received it I was highly impressed by the ease of assembly. The instructions are the clearest I have ever seen among my furniture kits. It is so comfortable as well, with the lower back pillow supporting my back and helping with my posture. Not to mention, it is quite durable and sturdy so far, holding up great to my ADHD-fueled spinning and rolling across the floor. I would absolutely buy this again!

    I've gone through a few chairs over the years. I've tried office chairs and 'gaming' chairs alike, but they always left me achy and would break down over the course of a few years. I take exquisite care of my stuff (frfr I'm a germaphobe) but I'd have chairs start to tear or fray and leave my back hurting SO bad that it'd make my stomach hurt. I can't say I have the best posture on the face of the planet since I am hyper-mobile but it was ridiculous. I decided to give this chair a try because of the reviews and it seemed reasonably priced compared to the Titan Evo chairs I was looking into ($800).Assembly: Took me a little longer than expected, the instructions aren't the best but are relatively straightforward.Comfort: Fabulous. I can sit criss cross. I can sit like a shrimp. I can kick back and watch a movie. I can hunch over to do my homework. OR I can even sit properly (sometimes). I've never had a sore back no matter how long I've sat in the chair.Price and quality: I'd say this is mid tier quality. A step above ""you get what you pay for"" and a step below ""overpriced gucci chair"" that most companies market towards gamers to price gauge the title of 'gaming chair'.Is it worth it? Yes. I think you are mostly paying for functionality here and not style or aesthetic. Just a generic ol' gamer chair.

    I should put a disclaimer first and foremost that I'm not a gamer. I'm a writer.... which means I do spend long periods of time seated in front of a screen. My last chair has been falling apart. That's beside the fact that it was generally uncomfortable and awkward to sit in. I've had my eyes on this chair for weeks. I've added and removed and re-added it to my shopping cart, lol. Read reviews, watched videos, checked out the Q&A section, etc. Finally, I decided to bite the bullet....so far, I'm pleased!Is the chair the most comfortable chair I've ever sat in? No. It's not even the most comfortable office/gaming chair I've sat in. BUT, for the price, I think it's a good deal. It's comfortable enough that I can see myself sitting in it for hours with no issues. It feels sturdy and the overall quality seems great for the price (though, obviously, time will tell).It was pretty easy to put together. I put it together in under an hour. I should mention that I'm not at all good with building furniture. Yes, even office chairs, lol. It's just not my thing. I've been known to give up after a frustrated rant riddled with one too many profanities. But building this chair was a pretty easy task. I still struggled with piecing together the back and seat portions of the chair (difficult when doing solo), but it was only for a couple minutes. I will say I don't have the foot rest attached, because I couldn't get mine to do so correctly, lol. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, though, as I was pretty indifferent about that feature.Overall, I'd give this 4 out of 5 stars. I took off a star for the footrest mishap. Everything is pretty good. I even like the shade of pink, which I was also worried about when ordering online. I would recommend!

    Have used the chair for a day now after building it, and I am pleased with the overall function especially for the price. It’s is not the best chair in the world, but it is a very good chair and a comfortable one. It reclines far enough to take a nap in with the foot rest, and a vibrating pillow on your lower back. The pillow on top for your neck is tops off making this chair very comfortable.I would highly recommend this chair if you need an above average office chair that’s not going to break your bank. for the price it’s excellent. Building it was easy too and not long, 45-1 hr and it a a short hour. Easy instructions as well.I will say if you are a heavier person I feel like this chair won’t support you as well, at least the foot rest . It says 250lb limit and beileive it’s because of the foot rest as it’s not held in the trails at multiple points, just one screw. Keeps it from sliding forward. Luckily Im I on The lighter side so the foot rest has been my favorite part

    I wanted to wait a week before I did my review and here are my thoughts.  For the price, this is a great chair and I'd buy it again.  I work from home 80% of the time and also play Xbox at night in the same room so I use a chair A LOT.  Previously, I had a cheap desk chair from Amazon that I got in 2020 when the world shut down and we were all working from home.  I'll just do pros and cons:Pros:1. Easy to assemble.2. VERY sturdy chair.  Metal frame and smooth wheels, height and recline adjustments are very smooth and natural3. Vibrating lumbar pillow is a plus.4. Recline is great and feels sturdy.5. Nice to have a pull out footrest.6. Very large seat cushion.  I'm a small guy and can easily sit with my foot under my leg in like a ""4"" very comfortably.7. Cushions on the arms are soft and great for sitting all day.8. Every function is very smooth and feels very sturdy.9. They give you some extra parts.  I was actually missing a couple washers needed for assembly and found what I needed in the ""extra"" parts.10. Neck/head pillow is soft and comfortable.  It's very small but definitely standard for most of these gaming chairs.Cons:1. Seat cushion is NOT very soft.  In fact, it's a little too firm in my opinion.  I found sitting for long periods of time, my butt getting kind of uncomfortable.  I'm assuming over time it will get softer but I wish it had more of a memory foam type cushion on top of the foam.  I got a cheap memory foam cushion pad for my old chair and am actually using it on this one which does help, but then that also puts your position on the chair higher.  This in turn makes the lumbar pillow lower than it really should be.2. The leg rest comes out easy for me (saw some people having issues and you need to make sure the mounts are straight when assembling, they are adjustable as you tighten).  However, the way the leg rest flips out to use makes it very easy for it not to stay where it's supposed to be.  If you rest anything on the inside part of the leg rest, it's going to want to flip into it's storage position.  If you have your legs straight this is not an issue but I found this cumbersome at times.3. It gets kinda warm.  If you're sitting with shorts on or I would imagine if you didn't have a shirt on for some reason (don't know why you wouldn't but you do you), your skin with start to stick to it a bit.  Obviously it's not like getting into a hot car in the summer, but just something to think about.3. Being a shorter guy I wish it did go just a tiny bit lower.  My desk at home is even a little higher than some ""normal"" desks and it doesn't fit under the desk even in it's lowest position.  I can make it fit, but it scrapes the arm cushions a bit and I could see that ripping them in time.  Certainly not a deal-breaker, but if you're used to storing this under your desk, this may be an issue for you as well.4. For the vibrating pillow, you must be connected via USB to a power source.  I'm guessing you could use some type of battery pack but there's also no on/off, once you plug in you're on until you unplug.TL;DR: Great chair for the price.  Seat cushion could be softer imo but function/style/stability is on point.  Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a gaming chair and don't want to spend a lot of money.

    Highly adjustable for seating and reclining preference. The chair and parts do not feel cheap or like it won't last long. The reclining feature has a lock to set it exactly where you want it. The bottom back pad has a vibrating feature which while not like a massage chair, feels nice to use. Too many gaming/computer chairs are way overpriced; for what you get, this chair is a solid purchase. May not fit larger legs or waist, (I'm 230lbs, 250lbs would be the upper limit for seat space between arm rests). On the stiff side, but with back and head cushion.

    I got this chair on sale for $110 (not counting shipping) which I recommend you do.Assembly: It took barely an hour to put together and could’ve honestly been quicker than that had I not been multitasking. It’s incredibly easy/simple to assemble, a child (of good enough strength to tighten the screws and lift the chair) could build this. Despite it’s simplistic construction is feels smooth and sturdy.Experience: initially, it felt cheap. The sides of the backing of the chair feel as though they are lined with pool noodles, which threw me off at first. I was worried the chair was going to be stiff or uncomfortable. However, I was pleasantly surprised! It’s very comfortable to sit in, and the telescoping arms and foot rest are incredibly appreciated. I will say the plastic of the arms feels on the cheaper side and they already seemed a little wobbly shortly after construction. This can likely be amended by tightening the screws. The lumbar support pillow sits a little low for me, so I wish it adjusted to an even higher point, but I will say I am rather curvy so that’s likely a me problem. The headrest pillow is very nice and the backrest reclines and locks well, doesn’t feel wobbly or like it’s going to tip backwards. The chair also sits very low which was wonderful since it fit under my bunk bed, *and* fit my legs comfortably under my desk, which is impressive since most others do not (I have thicker thighs).Summary: I think this chair is definitely one of the best on the market for the price point. It’s not exactly top of the market quality but that’s to be expected for only $110. I would expect slightly better quality if I were paying the full $200 for it, though. Recommended on sale, and especially for those on more of a budget. Exceeded expectation. 8/10

    It is exactly what we were looking for ! True to specifications, easy to follow instructions, and came with a few spare pieces of hardware just in case ! I think the purple is even prettier in person ! Very comfortable and sturdy.

    This is a fantastic gaming chair for the price! The seller shipped it promptly after I ordered ,and when I received it I was highly impressed by the ease of assembly. The instructions are the clearest I have ever seen among my furniture kits. It is so comfortable as well, with the lower back pillow supporting my back and helping with my posture. Not to mention, it is quite durable and sturdy so far, holding up great to my ADHD-fueled spinning and rolling across the floor. I would absolutely buy this again!

    I've gone through a few chairs over the years. I've tried office chairs and 'gaming' chairs alike, but they always left me achy and would break down over the course of a few years. I take exquisite care of my stuff (frfr I'm a germaphobe) but I'd have chairs start to tear or fray and leave my back hurting SO bad that it'd make my stomach hurt. I can't say I have the best posture on the face of the planet since I am hyper-mobile but it was ridiculous. I decided to give this chair a try because of the reviews and it seemed reasonably priced compared to the Titan Evo chairs I was looking into ($800).Assembly: Took me a little longer than expected, the instructions aren't the best but are relatively straightforward.Comfort: Fabulous. I can sit criss cross. I can sit like a shrimp. I can kick back and watch a movie. I can hunch over to do my homework. OR I can even sit properly (sometimes). I've never had a sore back no matter how long I've sat in the chair.Price and quality: I'd say this is mid tier quality. A step above ""you get what you pay for"" and a step below ""overpriced gucci chair"" that most companies market towards gamers to price gauge the title of 'gaming chair'.Is it worth it? Yes. I think you are mostly paying for functionality here and not style or aesthetic. Just a generic ol' gamer chair.

    I should put a disclaimer first and foremost that I'm not a gamer. I'm a writer.... which means I do spend long periods of time seated in front of a screen. My last chair has been falling apart. That's beside the fact that it was generally uncomfortable and awkward to sit in. I've had my eyes on this chair for weeks. I've added and removed and re-added it to my shopping cart, lol. Read reviews, watched videos, checked out the Q&A section, etc. Finally, I decided to bite the bullet....so far, I'm pleased!Is the chair the most comfortable chair I've ever sat in? No. It's not even the most comfortable office/gaming chair I've sat in. BUT, for the price, I think it's a good deal. It's comfortable enough that I can see myself sitting in it for hours with no issues. It feels sturdy and the overall quality seems great for the price (though, obviously, time will tell).It was pretty easy to put together. I put it together in under an hour. I should mention that I'm not at all good with building furniture. Yes, even office chairs, lol. It's just not my thing. I've been known to give up after a frustrated rant riddled with one too many profanities. But building this chair was a pretty easy task. I still struggled with piecing together the back and seat portions of the chair (difficult when doing solo), but it was only for a couple minutes. I will say I don't have the foot rest attached, because I couldn't get mine to do so correctly, lol. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, though, as I was pretty indifferent about that feature.Overall, I'd give this 4 out of 5 stars. I took off a star for the footrest mishap. Everything is pretty good. I even like the shade of pink, which I was also worried about when ordering online. I would recommend!

    Have used the chair for a day now after building it, and I am pleased with the overall function especially for the price. It’s is not the best chair in the world, but it is a very good chair and a comfortable one. It reclines far enough to take a nap in with the foot rest, and a vibrating pillow on your lower back. The pillow on top for your neck is tops off making this chair very comfortable.I would highly recommend this chair if you need an above average office chair that’s not going to break your bank. for the price it’s excellent. Building it was easy too and not long, 45-1 hr and it a a short hour. Easy instructions as well.I will say if you are a heavier person I feel like this chair won’t support you as well, at least the foot rest . It says 250lb limit and beileive it’s because of the foot rest as it’s not held in the trails at multiple points, just one screw. Keeps it from sliding forward. Luckily Im I on The lighter side so the foot rest has been my favorite part

    I wanted to wait a week before I did my review and here are my thoughts.  For the price, this is a great chair and I'd buy it again.  I work from home 80% of the time and also play Xbox at night in the same room so I use a chair A LOT.  Previously, I had a cheap desk chair from Amazon that I got in 2020 when the world shut down and we were all working from home.  I'll just do pros and cons:Pros:1. Easy to assemble.2. VERY sturdy chair.  Metal frame and smooth wheels, height and recline adjustments are very smooth and natural3. Vibrating lumbar pillow is a plus.4. Recline is great and feels sturdy.5. Nice to have a pull out footrest.6. Very large seat cushion.  I'm a small guy and can easily sit with my foot under my leg in like a ""4"" very comfortably.7. Cushions on the arms are soft and great for sitting all day.8. Every function is very smooth and feels very sturdy.9. They give you some extra parts.  I was actually missing a couple washers needed for assembly and found what I needed in the ""extra"" parts.10. Neck/head pillow is soft and comfortable.  It's very small but definitely standard for most of these gaming chairs.Cons:1. Seat cushion is NOT very soft.  In fact, it's a little too firm in my opinion.  I found sitting for long periods of time, my butt getting kind of uncomfortable.  I'm assuming over time it will get softer but I wish it had more of a memory foam type cushion on top of the foam.  I got a cheap memory foam cushion pad for my old chair and am actually using it on this one which does help, but then that also puts your position on the chair higher.  This in turn makes the lumbar pillow lower than it really should be.2. The leg rest comes out easy for me (saw some people having issues and you need to make sure the mounts are straight when assembling, they are adjustable as you tighten).  However, the way the leg rest flips out to use makes it very easy for it not to stay where it's supposed to be.  If you rest anything on the inside part of the leg rest, it's going to want to flip into it's storage position.  If you have your legs straight this is not an issue but I found this cumbersome at times.3. It gets kinda warm.  If you're sitting with shorts on or I would imagine if you didn't have a shirt on for some reason (don't know why you wouldn't but you do you), your skin with start to stick to it a bit.  Obviously it's not like getting into a hot car in the summer, but just something to think about.3. Being a shorter guy I wish it did go just a tiny bit lower.  My desk at home is even a little higher than some ""normal"" desks and it doesn't fit under the desk even in it's lowest position.  I can make it fit, but it scrapes the arm cushions a bit and I could see that ripping them in time.  Certainly not a deal-breaker, but if you're used to storing this under your desk, this may be an issue for you as well.4. For the vibrating pillow, you must be connected via USB to a power source.  I'm guessing you could use some type of battery pack but there's also no on/off, once you plug in you're on until you unplug.TL;DR: Great chair for the price.  Seat cushion could be softer imo but function/style/stability is on point.  Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a gaming chair and don't want to spend a lot of money.

    I'm 200lb and 5'2. Mainly use this to sit to do homework or play games. Assembled this by myself. Connecting the top part of the chair to the bottom part is a .... but it would've been easier if I had someone to help me.Pros: color is cute, armrest can be used lying down on the chair, neck pillow and back pillow is comfy, back pillow can massage, footrest, chair is comfy on my butt(very important I had to buy a butt pillow for my last chair)can be improved: wish there was a royal blue or lighter blue option, the armrest can't be adjusted lower or higher( I prefer it to be a bit higher), no on/off button on the massage pillow

    This chair would have been easier to put together if the screws would have been in easier packaging to open. The pictures are super small and once you get the screws out of the package it is hard to figure out which ones to use. Otherwise the chair was easy to assemble. It just took longer because of the packaging.

    Not bad, quality fits the price, easy to assemble. The lumbar massage pillow is a simple vibration, nothing fancy but it does feel good after doing some deadlifts or fight sports. Took me about 40min to assemble myself. The fabric option would probably be easier to maintain, because the fuax leather gets marked easier with sweat, its easy to clean, but I'll probably have to do it often.

    My boyfriend and I both got these and they are great, they don't take up much space and the colors are really nice. Super simple assembly though it seems a little intimidating. The footrest is a game changer. My only critique would be the neck and lumbar pillows do need to be adjusted every time you sit or move off of them but, it only takes a second so it's not a huge deal.

Putting together was very simple. It took me about a whole 40 minutes to put it together by myself, the chair itself was so comfortable literally between the leg rest and be able to recline all the way back. You could just fall asleep in the massaging pillow. Very nice touch. I am very very happy with this product.

    I like the chair and it seems well built. I have only had it about a week so time will tell. I use this chair in my home office which doubles as my gaming room. I had a big comfortable office chair that this is replacing. I will say this gaming chair is not as comfortable as my office chair. It doesn't rock back, but the back is adjustable and the lumbar massage pillow is nice, but there is no control for it. It's on or off and always on full vibration. I am 6' tall and 200lb and I think if I was any bigger this chair wouldn't work for me. I think a little more padding in the seat would be a nice upgrade. Like I said time will tell do I will update this review after I have used it for some time.
