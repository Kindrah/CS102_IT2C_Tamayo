    The set is great and sounds great. Easy to connect and I rarely have to charge the case  or them up. So it's a 5 star item to that I can say. And the price great too. So I could afford it. But no problems I'm have with the ear buds.

    I was a little skeptical at 1st. Being the price was low and their headphones so you don't really know till you use them. I love them!!! They are loud and when I'm on public transportation they do a great job of blocking out all the noise. The sound is clear and loud. They are easy to use. The battery last long and charges fast. They're comfortable. I haven't found one thing to complain about.  I definitely recommend them. Great especially for the price.  They're better than the last ones I paid $75 for.

    Due to other favorable reviews, I decided to try these when they were on sale. I am impressed with how great they are. Sound is good, charges fast, holds charge for a long time (I wore them all day at work and they were at 91% when I left), they pair super easy and they don’t fall out of your ear like Apple products. No complaints.

    These are great headphones for the price. I had a pair of AirPods that I used for years and they finally died and I didn't want to spend the money on new AirPods...so I bought these. I do a ton of Mtn Biking and trail running and I love them so far.Pros:-They pair immediatley on any bluetooth device.  You don't need to do the whole ""press a button for 20 seconds"" thing to pair like other headphones.-They fit great.  They come with 3 diff sizes of silicone ear buds. The default out of the box is installed with the medium buds and they fit great. Also, they are designed with an extension that wraps around the back of your ear which almost guarantees they will not fall out.-They are super light and the case is super light.-They charge fast and hold charge for a long time. I easily go over a week or so without having to charge.-The  sound is great and the controls are simple and easy to use directly from either side.Cons:  (Only 2 cons here but they both bother me which is why I am only giving 4 stars)-The charging case: As much as I love the lightweight and rapid charge...here is the problem: The shell of the case is SUPER slippery.  Like ""trying to hold a rainbow trout"" slippery.  I probably grab the case and it shoots out of my hands at least 5 times a day. I mean it when I say the case ""Shoots"" out of my grasp.  They need to use some sort of silicone on the shell. As a result,  I am looking for an aftermarket shell cover.-As much as I love the pairing...there is a downside: It automatically ""re""-pairs to the last device you used with the headphones.  If you want to use a different device next time, I find that I have to go into the previous device and ""unconnect"" the headphones in order to connect with new device. I use them overall with 5 devices- my iPhone, iPad, MacBook, AppleTV and Firestick.  It can get tedious...especially if you don't remember that last device you used. I know.... ""Champaign problems"" but still....Over all...I would 100% recommend these.

    My regular ear buds kept slipping out while sitting around even with the smallest ear pieces. I decided to get some over-the-ear buds. I googled the best ones and these were one of the options. It also listed as best seller on Amazon. I was skeptical how good they would be for the price, but honestly they're great! For basic listening it has great sound. I switched to the smallest fitting and they are snug and comfortable! Only downside which is no biggie is the case is slippery and the lid when you open it feels flimsy and will easily close on you. But again, for the price I really don't mind!

    The case charges quickly and can go several days before it gets low (under 20%). I use them mostly at work so I can only use one at a time. With the long life of the actual earbuds plus the charging case, I rarely need to charge it. Battery life deserves more than 5 stars honestly.I bought on sale both times and it has been one of the best money to quality ratios I have had.Only negative for me is that with both in it is hard to hear any outside sounds. I work at a camp so outside of summer there are only two to three other people here most of the time. Plus out doors I need to be able to hear some. That is why I usually use just one at a time. But that means it is great at blocking noise so that might be a positive for someone else.

    I love that the color was exactly as it looked online.  Great color choices.  I like that the earpieces are soft and fit nicely around my ear.  I also have small ear canals so the smaller foam buds worked great!!!

    Very happy with these. Personally, I think that ear clips are a must for ear buds so they don’t fall out. The case is fairly small and easy to stow, but pretty solid & protective. Sound quality is fine.Battery life is excellent. You take the ear buds out of the case, and they automatically turn on and connect to your nearby paired mobile device. You put them back in the case, and they automatically turn off (which pauses the music on your mobile device) and start charging. Unless you make very heavy use of them, you can go for long periods without needing to charge the case. Just don’t lose the case like I did (sigh…).One odd design issue is that, when you open the case normally, the right ear bud is on the left and vice versa. I don’t know why they did it this way since it makes them slightly more awkward to put on. The simple workaround is to open the case upside-down, which is easy enough.

    These earbuds are the VERY FIRST that totally stay in place and in my opinion fit perfectly on any ear as the wrap around the outside of the ear is flexible (and so comfortable).  I have very small ear canals and I can't say how many other earplugs over the YEARS I've bought that just won't stay in my ears. I had honestly given up until this pair - for some reason, I took another chance as I listen to audiobooks and I can't play them in waiting rooms or wherever vs read and you get the gist. I was ecstatic.  I'm taking forever to write this review so I can help someone who may need it.The pictures and description on this website are accurate EXCEPT the color.  I picked the green but the green I got is a dark green, not the bright color in the picture I had wanted,  I had to just now hold it to the light and be sure it wasn't black. I got a 2nd pair bc I can't find what I did with them - nothing to do with the product. So looking at the 1st order geez only in August 2023 per past Orders on Amazon I  happened to pick the same green but it's not the same - definitely not.  I'm not exchanging them but I liked the other color - the one in the picture - much more. There is no color shown on the website that matches the color I received. I may call customer service and put it on the record, in case. So again 2 months ago I bought the same pair - green though I didn't remember - the order says the pair was $29 with a $6 off coupon for $23!!!The product now has a red tab where the buttons that you click to turn the earbuds on and off, volume, and answer the phone. There are now THREE BUTTONS vs two from before. There are two raised black buttons on the inside of each earbud and now there is one round silver button that powers the earbud.  It says ""power on"" or ""power off"" when you click the silver buttons, no confusion!  You can see the silver button on each earbud when you open the case.  Remember, this lets you turn on only one for use vs always two.  You need to ""pair"" these which is so easy, just do a Bluetooth scan. I just shook my head and bent down - no problem at all. It comes in a nice black plastic carrying case that snaps shut and each earbud individually fits in its place in shape (vs just loose inside).  I bought these again bc I couldn't remember where I put them.  At this price point (an unbelievable $39 then a checkmark gives ANOTHER 40% off at checkout equals just under $23!!!).The earbuds come in and MUST BE KEPT in THIS black case when not in use or when you're done using them. Without the case, you can't charge the earbuds,  The black plastic case when open shows you the charge % left from 0% to 100% (I'd say it fully charges in 2 hours. I plug the container in overnight.  It  does NOT need recharging often and there is NO GUESSWORK.NOTE:  WHEN YOU OPEN THE WHITE BOX which HOLDS THE BLACK CONTAINER WITH THE EARBUDS FITTED WITHIN, YOU NEED TO LOOK INSIDE THIS WHITE BOX FOR A SLIM WHITE PIECE OF THE BOX THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S JUST THERE TO FILL SPACE. HOWEVER, INSIDE THAT BLANK WHITE THING ARE THE EXTRA EARBUD SIZES AND THE SHORT UBB CHARGE CORD OF ABOUT 6-8"".  THE CASE IS THE CHARGING STATION INTO WHICH YOU PLUG THE SMALL SIDE OF THE USB CORD.I'm not going to do any more proofing or editing.  I am not associated with these earbuds except they are great for ME.  It literally took me over an hour to write this review.  Excuse any errors, pls.

    New review: It's been a few days and the mic quality was good for the first day then awful the rest of the days.  I'll keep these because it seems good for audio books and walks, but they don't seem too good in general.  Worth maybe the 28$ for the convenience and battery power, and a good fit.  They're comfortable on the ear which is worth a lot for me.  But definitely not worth that full price of 70$, too poor and inconsistent quality for that much money.  If I had got them full price I'd get a return, but for the half off sale I'll keep them.Old Review: I just got these today, and they arrived charged.  I'm writing this review because I am very pleased.I am a soprano and have a high pitched voice, lots of mics won't pick up my voice.  This mic does pick up my voice and transmit it whether I am calling on my cell phone or calling with an internet phone proxy like discord.  The only time it doesn't pick up my voice is when I am doing something (like cutting cardboard, or folding cardboard, or moving bubblewrap, then the mic is too weak to transmit my voice).For phone calls, the mic works consistently, my voice is quiet but the volume does not fluctuate.Listening to sounds from my phone works great.  For music, it plays smoothly without static on bluetooth with wifi.  The volume buttons work on both sides, this is for both right handed and left handed people.One thing I found a bit weird was that the charging case said they were about 90, it was vacillating between about 85 and 95, imprecise, and stayed at about 89.  When I connected to my phone, my phone says they are 100% charged.I'll see how that plays out, I am not sure I like the inconsistency.I really loved the packaging, it was sleek and had clear instructions on how to make your waranty with the company Bmani.  The instructions for how to use the earbuds were also clear.  I'll probably keep the packaging until it falls apart like how I keep Apple packaging.The case the earbuds charge in is super sleek, it has a weak magnetic clasp that isn't difficult to open.  I already have insulation foam and just put two touch points on either side of the case to deal with the slippery ness of the case, which is making it a lot easier to keep a hold of the case while flipping the lid open and closed.  I'm clumsy, but other people could also benefit from having some silicone on the edge of the case to keep a hold of the earbuds.My ears are a big small, the around ear part of the earbuds feels a bit too large for me, but its comfortable.  I switched out the silicone earbud with the smaller size, they arrived equipped with the medium size and had a smaller and larger piece inside the packaging, it was easy to do when you use force to just bump the earpiece into the earbud.  I don't see the string they advertise comes to connect the earbuds in the packaging, I know someone else mentioned receiving that.Overall the only issue I have is that I did not receive the strap that connects the two earbuds to each other securely.  I have no idea how to test the sound cancellation quality.When I take off the earbuds and put them on the table, I can't hear my friend talking on my earbuds when I am 1ft away from them.  This is good, only you hear when you're wearing the earbuds, everyone in the room can't also hear your conversation.

    These didn’t come with a charging cord. They were also black, not blue, though if held up to the light and turned, there was some midnight blue visible on the charging case. Overall……very disappointed.EDIT:I was originally not sent a cord with the earbuds I ordered. I also didn’t think they were blue. The company reached out immediately offering a refund or replacement. They sent a replacement, this time complete with the different earbud sizes (got those the first time) and a charging cord. I am an extremely happy customer. I don’t often deal with customer service because I tend to rate high but this is BY FAR the best experience with any company/seller customer service I have ever had. They truly care about the customer. This is how online shopping SHOULD BE ALL THE TIME. So, thank you to this company. I have taken this to 5 stars and wish I could give them 10.

    I actually had my original set of these earbuds replaced because they were missing the addtional eartips that is listed in the ""what's in the box"" user guide.  So I sent the original item back & just did an exchange. The replacement had all the parts.  I'm just getting used to them and so far I am really enjoying them. Noise cancellation isn't perfect, but does work better when the volume is turned up higher; sound quality is very good for this price point.  Haven't had to test out the battery life yet, but since I mostly use them @ work, I haven't had to challenge their lifespan before needing a recharge.  Overall I am pleased with these.  They are light weight and don't bother my ears.Little Updated after 3 days of wear - the volume control on the buds doesn't always work and changing out the eartips is a bit of a pain in the butt.  Overall - I am still very pleased with these.  The charge lasts for several days even with me using them 10-12 hours at a time.  I typically wear them at work (usually only in one ear) so when one of the earbuds charge is getting low, I can just switch it out for the other one.One suggestion I'd make to the manufacturer --create a place in the case that holds the additional eartips and charge cord - even if it means the case is a bit larger - it would be nice if everything was in one container so there is less likely to lose anything.

    I have small ears and struggle to find headphones that won’t fall out when I’m running or biking.  I bought my first set of these in 2021, and now have 4 of them.  They all still work well despite being exposed to moisture, the inside of my bag, travel to the beach, heat, etc.  The reason I bought so many is because I have ADHD and tend to lose headphones inside my bags and pockets.  When these went on sale I knew I wanted to get a couple of extra pairs so I don’t have to waste so much time hunting for my headphones when I left them somewhere. The sound quality is decent for the price.

    Sorry for the terrible picture BUT I absolutely love this product. Bought these back in November of 2022, and it is now march of 2024 and they are just as good as the day I bought them.I have really small ears and most earbuds do not stay in my ears but these do! The over the ear makes them great for working out in and the battery life is AMAAZING. I work an 8 hour shift and they are good for that and then some; absolute best purchase that I have made in a very long time. Battery life is still outstanding as well. I NEVER leave reviews but these have just been so great that I figured I should leave a review cause they are great.

    Great but not perfect headphones. Great for people who have trouble keeping headphones in! I love the fact it wraps the behind the ear to keep in place when exercising. Has great sound and very comfortable. The charge is great last for almost an entire day or more with constant use.I don’t like that it is not compatible with Siri, so unlike AirPods I cannot speak to text handsfree. When I try to press the button to answer a call it hangs up doesn’t matter which side. So silly things like that don’t make it completely hands free.Besides that it’s reliable for not falling out of your ear as much as ear buds

    I had to switch to the smallest bud but it was super easy to connect. The sound quality is superb for the price! I don’t charge the case for days and i use the earbuds atleast 4-5hrs a day. I have yet for them to die on me. The buttons are super easy to use and work great. I sweat a crazy amount wearing these at the gym and it has not caused one issue with the sound quality. I already bought another pair in case these die on me in the future!

    Needed a wireless headset that lasted all day while I worked. Went thru 2 different sets that claimed to have enough battery life, but failed. This set is great. Doubly so as I tend to use just 1 ear piece at a time and even that 1 has yet to not last all day, but if it ever does run out I'll pull it's partner out and switch.The sound a controls are good as well. In the end I am happy with this purchase.

    Earbuds always fall out of my ears within a minute if walking around. I ordered these and they are the absolute BEST! They don't fall out, they're easy to use and the sound quality for the price point is amazing! I took off a star because the left ear bud is on the right side of the case and the right earbud is on the left side of the case. It's very awkward. The case is also really cheaply made.

    I love these earbuds. I always struggled to find a good set that stayed in my ears. Overall, this style suits me well, and I love the color choices (I got pink,) and their quality. I even got a set of these for my fiancé in green. Overall, I was, and still am, happy with them, just disappointed about their longevity.I bought a pair of these in June or July last year and started having volume issues a few months in. One earbud would be quieter than the other. I was not terribly bothered by this since I can manually adjust the loudness of one earbud in my phone settings, but it was frustrating since they were new. This persisted and eventually got better over time with routine cleaning, but eventually, and recently, an earbud just up and died on me. Had to finally get a new pair when the first could not even last a full year with just normal wear and tear.Despite this issue, they are still great earbuds. Great quality, lightweight, comfortable. Just wish their lifespan was not so wonky. I would still buy again.

    Very comfortable with glasses (RX & Sunglasses). Fit is secure. These will be great for exercise & an upcoming, overseas flight to Europe. I’m excited that I’ll not have to be worried about my normal earbuds falling out, mid flight, and being lost on the plane. They’re compact. I’m also looking forward to the extended charge of 24+ hours. We’ll see. I’ve not charged them up, yet.

    I have had my pair a year. I use them to listen to audio books or a movie to sleep.  They work well and the only reason I did not give full stars is because after a year one of the earbuds does not like to charge in the dock. The battery lasts about 12 hours for an audio book that goes that long or a movie. I know that most want them for music, and they do very well. I have never used them to answer a phone call so no idea about that ability. When this pair dies for good i will defiantly get this one again.

    I got these because my beats stopped working and I didn’t want to spend a lot on a replacement. These are way better than the beats in my opinion.

    Great headphones. I use it daily; I like to just keep them on all day and play music or podcasts on and off (during breaks).However, the right side stopped charging after 7 months of use. I wasn't exactly sure if it was because of the headphones themselves or the case charger. Either way, I reached out to the seller, and immediately, a replacement was sent. Now I get to use them even longer!

    4.5 stars only because: Either the volume contol on these ear buds is not working or I don't know how to work it. Likely the latter BUT may be a safety issue??Other than that, these earbuds are great! they sound good, they are easy to pair with my devices and they are a gamechanger when it comes to my workouts.I have been saved from having to buy expensive airpods--thanks BMANI!

    I bought these when my mpow flame 2s died. I see on Amazon there are a bunch of vendors selling various reskinned mpow models, but I didn't feel like taking a chance on overpaying for an inferior model (many aren't clearly labeled because they are trying to pass off as another brand entirely, so I don't know which model is which, in regards to old mpow model labels.) I went into these headphones expecting a comparable item, hopefully a little better, but not worse.Sound quality is kind of difficult to quantity, and everyone's hearing is different, but I find these to be at roughly the same quality level as my old headphones. It lacks a little bit of the bass the flame 2s had, but the sound is a little clearer. Overall a decent lateral move.I originally wanted wired headphones specifically, because I work during the summers with one headphone in, and the other ear free. These headphones can run with just the left, or right, unit in ear, while the other one can be in the case charging. This lets me use up the battery of one while the other reacharges, which is a big plus.The range is pretty decent for this price point, I get about 40ft unobstructed or 30ft with walls and such.The pairing was an unexpected bonus. It's very quick (both pairing to one another and to my devices) and when I want to put them away I don't need to individually shut them off and put them in the case. I can just take them out of my ears and place them in the charging case, and they automatically unpair and shut down. Same goes with taking them out, I just remove them, and they automatically turn on and pair to each other and then my device.Battery life is about what's advertised and the case battery hold multiple full charges. I use them regularly and find I only need to plug them in every few days. The case shows the case battery charge remaing.There are a few negatives. While the case will show the headphones charging (with a multi led indicator light rising) it doesn't show real time capacity. So, for example, there are 3 or 4 small leds, one set for R until one for L, that will turn on when you place the headphones in the case. It will flash the bottom light then middle light and last top, but that cycle will just repeat until they are full, at which point the lights turn off. They won't illuminate halfway when at 50% ECT. So I know when they are charging and when they are full, but not by how much, which seems like an odd choice given there are multiple lights there, seemingly to do just that.Another negative is the case feels very flimsy, especially at the joint. You need to be careful opening and closing, if you need these to last.Last negative I have is how the headphones hook into my ear. I need to have them tilted upwards (with the earband pushed further down the back of my ear) to get them to stay put. It sorta looks weird, like normally these types of sport headphones have the body of the until point straight ahead, and not pointing up towards my eye level. It's not a big deal, because they stay in decently well when fixed this way, but it feels like it's not supposed to be that way, at least compared to any other Bluetooth sport headphones I've used. These buds won't fall out of ear, but if I'm vigorously moving or talking, they can sometimes lose that tight in ear seal that gives the best sound quality and blocks outside noise. For my uses they do a good enough job though, and at least they don't straight up fall out.Overall I'm pleased with my purchase. I got them on sale (at time of posting) for around $26, which I feel these headphones are worth that much and a bit more. I'd probably pay up to $30 (maybe $35 if this specific style or brand had something others didn't and I wanted) but not more than that. These are decent budget headphones. I feel it's a good buy for money asked and would buy again. I hope this review can help some people decide on what to buy. In a sea of choices and reviews it can feel daunting.

    Gave my husband a pair of these for Christmas and he loves them. My kids lost the charging case as my husband had them in and was using them. He reached out to customer service and they sent us a whole new pair of buds/with case. They said it could take 10 days and it came in two! Great product with excellent service! Will be buying them again for gifts

    These have over 42K reviews so I decided to give them a try. Pairing both at the same time was a bit tricky but I finally got them both to play simultaneously and the sound is really great. They don’t look at all like the photos though. Not shiny and turquoise but matte colored and green. I’m disappointed by that as part of my choice was the color selection but they work well so they’re not a bust.

    Overall great headphones for this price!! the reason I only gave 4 stars is that the sound quality is not like the more expensive ones, but for $30 it's worth its money. but don't expect to get top-quality sound. but they are perfect if you use them for just talking. the music sound is what I did not like so much.

    I had a three-star side where them again definitely five star. One reason is the backup and forward feature while I listen to books the other is the distance that these have are awesome. I left my apartment went next door to the laundry room thick walls and they were still playing. Would buy again

    First, I don't write many reviews - but I will say I like these earbuds.The test will be how long they last.  But these last two weeks I have used them alot and really like them.Good sound quality, yet I can still hear a bit a noice outside (which I prefer).My real test will be when riding my bike.  I will try to update this review in the future, as I do depend on honest solid reviews of products!

    I like these ok. They sound good, I can wear my sunglasses with them in my ears, but they really are kind of ugly and they look a little bulky on my ears.Sound I’d give 10/10Style/Look I would give 4.5/10

    I bought these to use at work and they work great! I work in a machine shop and they will reach from one side of the building to the other before shutting off. Can answer phone by touching button, and clear sound.  These are super nice. Would most definitely recommend.

    These headphones have been lifesaving and are the only pair that I can find that don’t  fall out of my ear.. these headphones have been thru hell and back and still work! My dog chewed one of the two ear buds and all tho it was damaged it still worked and played sound! I went to the laundry mat yesterday and forgot them in my jeans! These things went thru an industrial washer and then were dried for over a  hour and STILL WORK! I audibly laughed as I was stunned! The case was still charged and they look just the same. I never review products but these are gonna be my go to earbuds forever!!

    I’m actually really impressed with this product! I was expecting some type of flaw with the price but honestly can’t find one! It charges up fast.. fits perfectly in my ear(with the other replaceable earpiece) doesn’t fall out, sleek design and great price! I guess the only downfall is the process of pairing it to a new device but that doesn’t concern me much because I only use it with my phone(just the time my bf used for his phone I had to get out directions) other than that it’s great!

    Easy to put and stay in place.  Battery life is excellent. The sounds quality for me is fine. I used it to hear podcast and things like that. About Noise cancellation, I can hear everything outside the earbuds, but I can hear everything ok.

    First, these earbuds stay in my ears which is more than I can say about Apple AirPods. The loop over the ear is perfect for me. The sound is very good and it's very clear on things like podcasts and audio books. There is just one complaint for people who like me want to use the same set of earbuds on multiple devices. The connection to the last used device is not broken until you manually do it in the bluetooth settings. And then you must immediately connect it to the other device or it will go back to the first device. I have not experimented with what happens if the previous device is not in range. But my bluetooth speaker (Wonderboom) does not have this problem.

    Out of the box, easy start up simply charge and pair. In fact, they were already charged 92% so it only took a couple of minutes to hit 100%. I like that they make it impossible to miss the warranty signup.  The case has a seal/band around it with a QOR to scan.  Only had to fill out a couple of fields and your done.  The sound is really good.  Nice base and balancing. The controls are very simple with audio confirmations. You cannot ask for anything more.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the case.  It seems a bit flimsy. If you turn it upside down with the door closed and shake it a bit, it comes open.  Very minor issue.  Again, this had a big mark down and easily could be a $60+ product. Very wise buy for me as I needed a new pair for the gym but did not want to drop $200.

    I love the design! Very sleek. The casing, the digital numbers to let you know how much battery life remains in the charging case. I've just tried the volume and the BASS!!! I'm very happy with my purchase!

    I bought this to have while my kids are asleep and I want to watch something while I work. They connected to my phone easily. They sound ok. It’s basic but it works for what I need. When I make a call my mom can barely hear me when I talk. I’m not sure if that’s a setting or the actual device. But overall it works good.

    It was an Easter gift for my daughter and she loved it! I got her the pink one and was relieved to see that it wasn't a shiny pink, but an old rose color.

    This is my second time purchasing the same product because I like it. I had my 1st pair of headphones for 2 years and the only reason I have to replace them is because my youngest child lost one of the headphones.

    For the price, the quality is pretty good. Sound could be a little better, but does the job! Especially being active, they have yet to fall off my ears once.

    I really like the look of these earphones, and I suspected they'd be very comfortable in/on the ear, and they are. The issue I had with the original pair I purchased and then with the replacement is that the Volume + and - buttons don't seem to work. I tried both sets with the batteries fully charged and with iPhone and Amazon Fire devices and could not get the volume to go up or down. I tried holding down these buttons for several seconds, tapping, doing simultaneously...no luck. About every tenth try it displays a volume meter on the phone or tablet, but that vanishes in a second and there is no change in volume. The manual that comes with it indicates that all you should have to do is hold either + or - buttons to change the volume. All of the other features seem to work fine. One other thing to note: The pictures in the item description seem to show that the colors have a metallic tint of sorts. Both of the sets I tried (green and blue) has a flat finish. If you're okay with having to adjust the volume on the device that you are using vs. on the ear pieces these will probably work. I will use them mainly for listening to music, so I am keeping the replacement set. But even at a ""Deal"" price, the fact that the volume controls don't work, makes this an average value in my opinion. BTW, I looked online to troubleshoot the volume issue without success. Appreciate if anyone or the manufacturer has some suggestions.

    The package came within a few days. It was well packaged in an air tight wrap. The holder is sleek in design. The size is about half the size of a hard sunglasses holder. They look and feel very nice.

    I bought these for my husband as he needed a new pair of headphones before going on his work trip. I had previously been looking for a pair for myself and had seen all the good reviews these headphones had so I decided to buy him a pair. If you had a pair of the beats by dre that had the earpiece, these remind me a lot of those. Charge seems to last for them, and sound quality isn't bad at all. I would overall buy these again or a pair for myself. The only negative thing I can say about them is you can't get as far away from your device (ie: phone) with your headphones in as I could with my airpods.

    I got these for my husband because he wanted new bluetooth headphones. He says they are better than his airpods. His airpods fell out all the time and these don't. He also said the noise cancellation is really good and the sound quality is too. I also love the different colors which will hopefully help them stand out when he sets them down somewhere and then forgets where
