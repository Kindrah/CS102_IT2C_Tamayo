    TLDR: It's tape with a personality ‚Äì mostly sticks, sometimes picky. üì¶üîçü§îAh, packing tape ‚Äì the unsung hero of boxes and parcels. Here's a little saga of my experience with this particular tape, for anyone who's still reading and not already off taping something.Pros:This tape is tape through and through. If you're looking for tape, congratulations, you've found tape.It's got a knack for bonding with sticky and plasticky comrades ‚Äì a real team player.The dispensers are like ninjas, perfect for those ""I just set it down"" moments and then it's off to the Bermuda Triangle.Small rolls and dispensers are great for modest taping needs ‚Äì think arts and crafts, not moving day.Once it commits to sticking, it's in for the long haul. Unsticking? That's another adventure. Grab a blade (cool factor optional but recommended).Cons:Cardboard, the tape's arch-nemesis. To win this battle, rub vigorously to create some heat. If you lose, prepare for a tape tantrum in your trash can.""Easy Start""? More like ""Mission Impossible."" Scissors are not your friend here. Trust me, I've got the emotional (and maybe physical) scars to prove it.Small rolls, small victories. If you're packing up a lifetime, these rolls will feel like a sprinter asked to run a marathon.The dispenser's sound could be used in psychological warfare. Large box taping? Consider earplugs.Packing a house with these? Don't. Just don't. It's like bringing a toy shovel to dig a swimming pool.Conclusion:This tape and I, we've had our ups and downs. It's mostly stuck by me, holding things together like a silent, adhesive warrior. It's met most of my tape expectations without too much fuss. But for big jobs? Look elsewhere. This tape's more of a cameo artist than a main character.

    Original review: I was expecting brown packing tape which generally gets used to tape around boxes.  Instead this is just a bunch of transparent tapes, a bit thinner and not nearly as long as the rolls of transparent tape sold by the Post Office.  I guess it is strong enough to encircle a box to close it.  You get a whole bunch of them so I guess it's a good deal, but wastes plastic with the multiple dispensers .  As usual with transparent packing tape, you have to be real careful not to let it snap back onto the reel, it is hard as sin to get it started again with your finger nails.Addendum after 3 months of using - this is Great transparent tape - I'm upping my review to 5 star.  It is definitely strong enough to tape boxes closed.  Being not as wide across as some makes it easier to tape precisely.  But most of all, it RARELY folds back onto the main roll, becoming unusable.  Well not very often, you still have to be careful.  And of course you do have to thread the tape UNDER the little blue tab things which ""catch"" it if the tape is popping backwards.  But this is the first transparent tape I have ever used that works like it's supposed to - you pull it out an inch, start the tape where you want, pull the roll back slowly and carefully, it pulls out nicely if you hold the roll at the right angle, and then when done you just twist your wrist and the blade cuts it off very nicely and precisely.  And lo and behold, the dispenser is ready to use again, with the tape against front side of the dispenser (under the blade part.)  Occasionally it does snap back onto the roll, esp. if I am getting careless and doing it too quickly, but even then I found it somewhat easier to use my fingernail to peel it off that other dispensers (esp the ones sold by the Post Office, those get impossibly stuck almost every time you use them.)  So I am a happy camper with these.

    I love the convenience of being able to purchase products like this in bulk and have them delivered straight to my door.  It's always the things that continuously slip my mind to grab while at the store or that I never seem to have backup of at home when my roll runs out.  Sometimes it's just the simple things in life!At the time of my purchase it was a good value and saved me a little money from what I would have paid in the store.  The product is as expected and arrived packaged well and in new condition.I use this tape for shipping boxes and have had no issues with adhesion as it has always worked great for my needs.  I also like that it is super clear for taping over things that you would still like to be clearly visible.I will purchase again but, luckily for now, I am well stocked!

    We had to pack up our house of 37 years to move closer to family.  We ended up with 225 boxes!!!!  Without this tape I don't know how we would have managed.  It dispenses easily, grips well, and is very strong.  We really went through the tape so you need more tape than you think you do.  This packet does the job!  No regrets...glad we had so many because in all the mess the tape dispensers get misplaced easily so great to have multiple tape dispensers handy.

    A little tough getting the ""bitter end"" (the starting edge of the tape) off the roll at first, but once threaded through the handle guides, does just fine.  SU-PER-IOR to the dollar store tape in that it doesn't tear on its own (often in the middle of the strip) and restick itself back to the spool.  You definitely need scissors or to use the sawtooth blade at the edge of the handle.  Stickiness is good, and transparency perfect.

    From years of experience with packing and shipping, I‚Äôve come to realize that not all tapes are created equal. I‚Äôve had my fair share of frustrations with tapes that wouldn‚Äôt stick, tore easily, or simply couldn‚Äôt handle the weight of the items I was shipping. When I came across Scotch Heavy Duty Packaging Tape, I was pleasantly surprised at how it made a world of difference in my packing endeavors. This product not only meets but exceeds every expectation for a reliable packaging solution, and here‚Äôs why.üì¶ Exceptional Adhesive Strength: A Bond You Can TrustWhen it comes to packaging, the strength of the adhesive is a key factor. No one wants to receive or send out packages that have come undone in transit. With Scotch Heavy Duty Packaging Tape, that‚Äôs a worry of the past. The adhesive on this tape is incredibly strong, bonding instantly to a variety of box types, whether new or recycled. It has a long-lasting stickiness that ensures your packages stay securely closed, even when subjected to the rigors of shipping. Its high-tensile strength prevents stretching and tearing, even when wrapping larger, heavier items.üåü Optimal Width and Length: Perfectly Sized for Flexibility and EfficiencyThe tape measures 1.88 inches in width and comes in rolls of 22.2 yards. This size is perfect for most packing tasks, from small parcels to large moving boxes. You have enough tape to go around without needing to worry about running out in the middle of your task. Plus, each pack comes with six rolls and a dispenser, making it a long-lasting investment for both personal and business needs.üõ†Ô∏è Handy Dispenser Included: Effortless Application Every TimeThe Scotch Heavy Duty Packaging Tape comes with a convenient dispenser that makes application a breeze. The dispenser is easy to hold, and the blade is sharp enough for a clean cut but safe enough to avoid any accidental injuries. The dispenser also has a small tab to hold the tape end, preventing it from rolling back onto the roll, thus saving you the hassle of having to find the tape end each time.üçÉ Clear and Durable: Visibility and Longevity CombinedOne might not think the transparency of packaging tape is crucial, but I find it quite beneficial. The clear tape allows you to easily read any labels, barcodes, or other information on your packages. In addition, the tape is highly resistant to splitting and abrasion, ensuring your packages look as neat and professional as possible.üí≤ Cost-Effective: High Quality at a Reasonable PricePrice is often a consideration when purchasing any product, and packaging materials are no exception. I found the Scotch Heavy Duty Packaging Tape to be very reasonably priced, especially considering its high quality and durability. When it comes to ensuring the safe and secure shipment of your packages, this tape offers excellent value for money.üëç Final Thoughts: A Reliable Choice for All Your Packaging NeedsAfter weeks of use, I can wholeheartedly say that the Scotch Heavy Duty Packaging Tape is an excellent product. It has made the usually tedious task of packing and shipping significantly easier and more efficient. The high-strength adhesive, perfect size, durable material, handy dispenser, and reasonable pricing combine to make this tape an all-round winner. It‚Äôs a product I trust for all my shipping and packing requirements.In summary, if you‚Äôre in the market for reliable, robust, and efficient packaging tape, Scotch Heavy Duty Packaging Tape should be at the top of your list. Its superior quality and functionality make it a must-have for anyone who often finds themselves in the world of packing and shipping. Thank you for reading my review. I hope it aids you in making a well-informed purchase.

    I have tried many other brands of tape and they're always so flimsy and horrible, but for the price this is the highest quality tape I have found and Amazon has a great price on it. It's perfect if you were frequent eBay shipper and seller, making packing your boxes so simple and you don't have to use as much of the tape either because it's very heavy duty. I highly recommend this tape and I suggest that anyone go with this brand over a no name brand because you get what you pay for.

    This tape is the best out there!  So much better than other types meant for shipping or packaging.  I have tried other brands and this one sticks better for longer periods of time.

    I originally ordered this as I needed to ship something back and had no tape on hand to close up the box prior to shipping.  I've since used this on a variety of things and definitely put it to the test.  Where you'd expect it to keep adhesion, it has definitely done the job.  I even used it to reseal a box that had a heavy walking pad in it that needed to be returned.  Not once did I feel the box was going to come apart after I was done.  And none of the tape started coming apart from the box in transit.  After using this tape, you can pat whatever it was and give it the ole ""That's not going anywhere"".  And having a multipack of them is nice, so when I can't find the one I used last time, I just go grab another one lol.

    It's like the superhero of tapes ‚Äì ridiculously strong, yet surprisingly stealthy. Peeling it off the roll is smoother than a spy movie, and it sticks with the determination of a toddler refusing to let go of a toy. The way it clings to boxes is reminiscent of an overly attached ex, ensuring that nothing, not even a whisper of air, can escape. And if you make the mistake of letting it stick to itself? Ah, the delightful challenge of unpeeling it is a puzzle more complex than a Rubik's Cube. This tape doesn‚Äôt just seal packages; it seals my faith in the wonders of adhesive technology.

    Tried using generic brands from the big box stores and came back to Scotch.  While the generics were cheaper they were also essentially useless.  Scotch not only seals well, it also actually dispenses without shredding.

    I use this tape to secure postage labels onto a heavy paper envelope. The tape is strong and holds down the labels. The metal cutting mechanism makes it easy to cut off the tape. The one downside is finding the beginning of the tape roll when using it for the first time. You have to find the cutoff and peal it off. On more than one occasion I've had a hard time finding it and then peeling it off, wasting some tape in the process.
