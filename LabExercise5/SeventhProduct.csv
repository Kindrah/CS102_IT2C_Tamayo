    I purchased 2 keyboards for my gaming sons. The swapping of keys was easy. The keyboards held its charge well and lasted a day plus of frequent use (daily). The keys makes a clicky sound which is what my sons were going for.After a month of almost daily use, the space bar on one of the keyboards stopped working. There was nothing we could do to repair it at home. I reached out to the company via Amazon message and explained what happened. They replied promptly asking for a clarification of the problem and a picture of the problem. I submitted both and they offered us a replacement right away. It arrived in less than a week and works beautifully. They told us to discard the broken keyboard.The keyboard is good, but the customer service is excellent!

    I don't have much experience with gaming keyboards and I really just bought this to have a little more room on my desk at work, but I think it's pretty good. It's very clicky and while I do think it sounds just a little bit cheap, it's still satisfying to type on. I wish the lights were a bit brighter, but otherwise the variety of patterns it produces are fun. I haven't noticed any lag or connection issues, although I will mention that occasionally the @ and # are replaced with "" and £ seemingly for no reason. I assume I'm hitting some kind of hotkey that changes 2 and 3's special characters, but I've yet to figure out what I could be doing and it's JUST those two keys. At no point does anything else change what it types. It might even be a weird glitch, but it's rare it happens and it doesn't bother me enough to do anything about.That aside, I've been happy with it and I'd recommend it as a stepping stone for someone not looking to spend a ton on a mechanical keyboard. I think it makes a great starting point. It also came with additional red keys so you can swap them out if you don't want it to be the default color.

    Obviously there are better mechanical keyboards out there, but I don't think you'll find one for less than $30 better than this. I went with the blue switches because I am personally a fan of clicky switches. Following are my pros and consPROS-Affordable as hell, seriously if you have the money to buy a crappy membrane keyboard then you have the money to buy one of these- Ergonomic design. The back rows of keys are slightly higher than the lower rows which make for a very comfortable and easy to type on design. I usually take a few days to adapt to a new keyboard but this one just felt good right off the bat.- Consistent and decent quality switches. I've used cheaper keyboards before and they usually have some QC issues with some switches having a completely different feel from others, but everything is consistent and feels the same on this one.CONS- The switches sound a bit ""twangy"". There is a higher pitch sound to the switches that other blue's don't suffer from. This was mitigated by sticking a few adhesive foam pads inside the PCB tray, but without the foam the switches were kind of annoying, and I've been using various blues for 10 years now.-Variances in the different colored key caps. The keyboard comes with some red and black keycaps to replace the default grey ones, and they sound difference is STARK. The red caps sound light and metallic, while the blacks sound heavy and thuddy. I replaced the default grey space bar with a red one and it has a very very obvious sound difference from the rest of the keys.-It's not hotswapable, the entire PCB is soldered and doing any kind of customization is nearly impossible.

    I don't do well with the macbook keyboard if I am on the road for more than two days. Obviously everything needs to fit in my carry on luggage. This keyboard hits the sweet spot for me. I don't need translucent key caps nor multi-color lighting. USB wired is just fine. It fits perfectly at the bottom/back of my carry on. The blue switch is just what I am used to. The price is unbeatable.The frame is plastic, not metal. But it feels sturdy enough. Two levels of tilt adjustment by the folding feet.The included orange keycaps are fun. But some extra caps are obviously not for this compact keyboard, they may be for the larger one with number pad. I don't know if this is a mistake or they just drop the sam bag of selected orange caps.

    I only got this keyboard today and I am really happy about it. the keys are not loud, it is super small so it saves space, it comes with extra red key caps, and if you hold ""fn"" and then press the windows key it will lock the windows key so you don't accidentally tabbing out. The brightness is not very bright and it is difficult to remove key caps but overall a very good product

    Keyboard looks great and build quality is decent but feels cheap by times. Backlights is cold white , great and have diferent variations. Colors and design is great but there are some quality conmtrol flaws. I got the white-black and orange, out of the box it came with white and black key. Orange keys were packed in an extra bag wich is great but the miss is that the keyboard is a 60% so there is no number pad but orange keys included in bag include numb pad plus, minis, enter. Those ma be like extras but will prefered to see key that can be replace in the keyboard. Other downside is that the keyboard indeed is mechanical but it lacks of a spring that provide resistance to presure and key taping so key feel loose and whimpsy. For the pricepoint sure is a decent option but typing just feels like a toy.

    Feels pretty good for the price point. I thought it was the red switch version but it’s got brown switches. Must’ve just not caught it before I ordered it but it’s all good. Does what I need it to do. I’m not used to keyboard and mouse gaming really, so it’s still a bit awkward due to me primarily using an Xbox controller.But it does look great! And it has a nice weight to it. Doesn’t feel cheap either. Wish it was wireless but I would recommend so far.The spare key caps are not transparent lettering so it kinda messes with the LEDs coming through. Also a few extra red key caps that don’t really belong anywhere on the keyboard which was odd. I also wish that the keys that have dual function especially for things like volume were labeled. Oh well. Not a huge deal. Nice keyboard overall!

    I recently switched to this keyboard from a larger one as my old keyboard broke, and this one was at a very good price, in my opinion. I saw many other positive reviews, and it reinforced my need to buy it, and I do not regret it. This smaller keyboard makes all the difference when gaming, which I did not even know I needed, to be honest, but when you buy it, keep in mind you are getting the best quality for that price. While it is not the fanciest thing on the market, it gets the job done and is a top option if you are in the market for a gaming keyboard.

    it's a solid keyboard & chances are, that you'll get a fully operational one, but i was a bit unlucky. the 2 key was very inconsistent. i had to take the thing apart & resolder the switch because the original solder was basically half done. the other solders were solid, but it's just not good enough. most people are not going to have the knowledge to troubleshoot such an issue. from what I've seen in the other reviews, their customer service department would surely make it right, but it seems like a big waste of resources when it could all be avoided with a quality job in the first place. I'm glad I got the keyboard working, and will use it until it properly breaks, but it is unlikely I will ever purchase another item from this company.

    Si es tu primer teclado mecanico no esta para nada mal. ya si eres exigente entemas de estabilizadores,libricacion,acustica. yo creeo que no es el indicado,pero por el precio que lo compre en promo esta bastante bien. (ojo cabe aclarar no es Hot Sawp y no le puedes retirar los switches con tanta facilidad).¿Lo recomiendo? Si si es tu primer teclado y quieres comenzar en este mundo de los teclados,o si solo quieres un telacodo y no eres tan exigente.(otra aclaración si te gusta el RGB y quieres un teclado RBG este no tiene RGB solo un color estatico en Azul que no esta mal y tiene bastantes efectos de movimiento).No soy un experto en teclados pero te dejo mi reseña,de lo que pude ver y probar del teclado. Y chico,chica si ya lo compraste que lo disfrutes.

    good keyboard, nice colors, but mine came with weird marks. the marks are on all the keys, but they're extremely visible on the white keys (they're way more visible irl than in the attached picture, my camera isn't great). they aren't hard to clean, a bit of wiping with a wet cloth or something similar will remove them, but obviously it'd be better if it hadn't come with these smudges at all. it's a fine keyboard if you're willing to clean the keys a bit.

    Look, this isn't a $100 gaming keyboard. But it *IS* mechanical, and it *is* a keyboard, and it's a great way to determine if you want to enter the world of mechanical keyboards. Nice glow, good feel, relatively solid. If you're used to keyboard with separate function keys and a 10 key pad, it may take a little adjustment. I've found it to be a great keyboard for gaming with a controller where you need occasional keyboard use for other stuff. A stellar value for the price.

    if you’re looking for clickey keyboard is the one. I had one before but I gave it to my brother and I switched to the red switch, but I got bored of it, and I wanted some thing that actually made sound and I’m glad I bought this, I love the different settings on this. It doesn’t change colors though well at least the one i got doesn’t. but overall I rated a five.

    I usually go after a full keyboard and was surprised on how much I liked the smaller version without all th extra keys I never used on my other keyboard.  Have used it for a month now without any issues. I use it for writing and for gaming with no problem at all.

    Wanted to try out a smaller keyboard to optimize gaming, but all other options were very expensive and I found this one and it’s great for the price and it’s pretty responsive happy with it so far. I did like that you can switch out some keys of a different color but they don’t light up like the others they look to not have the see though lighting effect like the other keys already on the key board

    Great product for the price, lots of programmed keylight options. Love the red switch board, tactile but not obnoxious. Can’t speak to the longevity of how well it will last but if it lasts for more than a year I’d say it’s definitely worth it.

    Pros:- Small footprint on your desk- Nice travel and feedback - far nicer than a ""chicklet"" keyboard- USB-C connectivityCons:- I can barely read the grey keys, even with the backlight at full.  I'll likely return this one for one with greater printed contrast.

    I am an experienced user of MacOS and Linux and needed a way to share two computers with desktop versions of those operating systems  on my 27"" 4K monitors. Frankly, I am blown away with how well this switch works.  It is well constructed and even has a remote switch that allows me to alternate between the computers with a simple button push.  It even allows me to use my Logitech MX keyboard and mouse for both without having to set separate switches on those peripherals.  This might be the best piece of low priced tech that I have bought in quite a while.  I highly recommend it.

    Update: very good customer service. Also: I eventually got the flickering to stop after tweaking the monitor's refresh rates. I also got a brand new laptop and this one runs everything smoothly at 60hz (that is, one 4k monitor + one old 1200p monitor). Hopefully this information is useful to someone else.All in all, this KVM switch is pretty solid, especially at this price point.Original review: I am using this KVM switch with a 4k monitor and an old 1600x1200 monitor. If I set my 4k monitor at anything more than 30hz, it turns off for a few seconds every 20-30 seconds.

    When I first got this KVM switch, it felt like striking gold, an affordable KVM to use my multiple high-resolution monitors for work and for my gaming computer. It delivered on its promises, performing admirably and offering exceptional value compared to its counterparts. However, this initial joy was short-lived, as durability and functionality issues emerged over time.+ Seamless Switching: The ability to switch between work and personal computers was flawless, greatly enhancing my productivity and workspace efficiency.+ Incredible Value: For its price, the performance of the KVM switch initially seemed unbeatable, providing functionalities often reserved for higher-priced alternatives. High resolution, high refresh rate KVMs are usually hundreds of dollars.+/- The USB ports on the front of the switch aren't ideally placed, in my opinion, I wish the USBs were in the back even if the box needed to be bigger (makes it hard to cable manage)- Durability Issues: After only a month of use, the PC2 input malfunctioned and ceased working, raising concerns about the product's longevity.- Display Compatibility: When used with my 3840x1600 144hz monitor, the display would occasionally flicker. Despite trying different cables, inputs, and monitors, I'm convinced this is an issue with the KVM. When I plug my monitor directly into my computer with the same cable, I don't have this issue.While the KVM switch offers substantial value and impressive functionality at the outset, potential buyers should weigh these benefits against the possibility of encountering similar issues that I faced. It's a mixed bag - a product that promises much but may fall short on reliability over time. I assume users with lower resolution displays won't experience these issues, as it won't put as much strain on the KVM.

    After using this KVM switch, I wish I would have bought one sooner.  So nice to use two computers and two monitors with ease, all while using a common keyboard, mouse, and camera.  Slick!  Setup is easy.  Remember to turn the KVM switch ""ON"".  I missed that step in the instructions initially and thought it didn't work, however, a thorough review of the instructions pointed out my error.  If you need a 2x2 KVM switch, this is an excellent choice.

    This KVM switch works perfectly so far. Reminder (I was confused at first): you need lots of HDMI/DP cables. For example, I have 2 monitors and 2 computers so I need 6 cables. For 3 monitors it would be 9. So z=x+(x*y)

    It has been 24 hours since I've set mine up with 3 DPs and the controller button that is connected via audio label does not work. I was hoping to have my KVM hidden for my setup but I have to now have it easily accessible since the wire connected button does not let me manually switch between computers. Also, whenever I do switch computers, my mouse will have to be unplugged and plugged back in to work.

    I am using a wireless mouse and keyboard. They work great when plugged into the computer. When they are plugged into the KVM they disconnected frequently for a few seconds, and strange things happen like shift being stuck in an on mode. Also the two cords that are sent were usb A to usb C rather than usb A to A. This did not work for me since I need the usb C port to be available.

    It doesn't switch well between computers. I cannot recommend this.  I have had KVM switches in the past, and never had issues with them.

    After a couple months of light use (only around 10 hours per week) the ports began to fail. The button was dead on arrival. May have been a red flag, but wasn't needed for my build.

    Mac Studio with M1 Ultra and triple display video is unstable. 3rd screen doesn't resume from off and flickers. Tried with different cables and no change. Replaced with different brand that had no issues.Edit: Seller reached out and offered replacement or refund. Could have been a fluke that this one had issues but the seller was interested in resolving the issue for me. Good customer service.
