    Great product, fast delivery. These perform as expected, fit over my glasses, protected my eyes while viewing the eclipse. For the price, it's a great value.

    These glasses were great!  They were sturdy enough to survive a day in my backpack & still provided clear, safe views of the eclipse!  I highly recommend them!

    The glasses work great they are inexpensive. You get six pair. We had enough for us and my parents. If you take care of them, you can use them next time.

    These little glasses are sturdy. They were inexpensive. They have all the important certifications. There are a lot of fake ones going around so make sure to do your research before buying. These ones look legit so far. If I become blind after the Eclipse on the 8th I'll make sure to come back & change my rating.

    I bought them last week and I did not check them. I’ve read the 1 star reviews today and I was flipping out. I found a video of a scientist to test the glasses. Mine works PERFECTLY. You can try it by: go outside, put the glasses on and you should see NOTHING. Pitch black. Then turn your head to the sun and you should be able to see the sun perfectly (round orange ball). That’s the test.

    These eclipse viewing glasses are safe for eclipse viewing. They have the correct certification number as recommended . You do not have to wonder if you are getting glasses that are safe for use because they are being given away for free.

    Great product that works as advertised.  We used these glasses to view the October eclipse and they worked perfectly.  They allowed us to safely view the eclipse and are sturdy enough to use again for the April eclipse.  Would buy again if we needed more eclipse glasses.

    I saw a bombardment of 1 star reviews up to the eclipse day claiming that the glasses were not truly certified, lacked a certification logo, or that they were faulty.Well, now that the eclipse is over, I can say that my eyes are well intact and I don't have a permanent black hole in my vision. All 6 glasses were used and everyone was able to view happily. They rested over my glasses well enough. I'm not sure if there were warehouse mix ups with another brand or some other last-minute ordering/manufacturing issues with other people for them to leave the reviews that they did, but everything was good on our end.

    We watched the total eclipse today without any problems and it was nice to know that these worked quite well. We looked directly at the sun a few days before the eclipse without any problems so knew they would be good for the eclipse. So, for just a little bit of money we got to watch the eclipse and being in a location that we were in total darkness it was quite an experience to see. I am so happy with this purchase and highly recommend these glasses.

    Received a lot of posts and text that some were recalled. I looked it up and did some googling and one reddit user linked to this exact same listing as fakes. He compared them to the ones the libraries werr giving out  These are not fake and works. I'm not sure which seller he bought it from but the one with the Helioclipse store seems legit. My whole family got to experience cool science. I'm happy with them.

    There were two pairs of Helioclipse glasses that were not dark and probably could cause damage if used.  Good thing we compared all of them after being able to see everything with those two pairs.  Just hope the others work!!!

    These just arrived today. They seem like they will be great for watching the Solar Eclipse on April 8th. The whole family is excited to use them to watch the eclipse! I would buy these again!

    I gave these to the family in their Easter baskets.  They were used and shared with people far and wide.  I'm so glad they allowed us to safely watch the eclipse today.

    I was concerned if these would really be the certified glasses, but they're good. I couldn't see anything inside and when outside, I could only see the sun.

    Since we only had 60 percent totality it was important that they worked.Awesome job especially since they weren't expensive.

    These glasses worked great! We bought them to view the eclipse this past October and were so pleased that we decided to buy more for the upcoming April Eclipse. We passed extras out to people in the park last time and want to be able to do it again.

    My husband and I both had great success in viewing the eclipse last October. We all wore them over our regular glasses. I was even able to take a picture with my iPhone with the lense covering the camera.  My dad shared his pair with friends at a rehab facility so they all could view it too. We were all very pleased with how they worked so we’ve saved them to watch the next eclipse. Thank you!

    I didn't order them in time for the eclipse, but I have tested them on the sun at different times of day. I feel comfortable letting my kids use them this April for the eclipse in TX. Happy with my purchase. I may possibly tape some paper on the sides to make sure my younger kids don't try to look out the sides where the glasses arms are, but might not. Just will have to see.
