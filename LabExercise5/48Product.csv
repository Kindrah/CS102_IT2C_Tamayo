    Like the title says, this thing really impressed me.i wasnt expecting much, but this thing is really cool. Doesnt feel cheaply made at all, the manual is easy to understand.I'm not a hardcore gamer, i'm more of a casual player and this thing is perfect for me, plus the RGBs look really good with my keyboardalso, the scroll wheel is slightly concave and fits your finger nicelysmooth movement with the cursor as wellfeels like a $100 mouse for a fraction of the price.

    So far i see nothing wrong about the mouse after a month. It’s many lightyears better than my $9.00 mouse that glitches the DPI. Whenever i sometimes move my mouse and it randomly X out all my tabs without moving it to that direction. Which is annoying as hell.Pros: Im not too critical about mouses but i will give my realistic and honest opinion from my experience. Very beautiful design and color options. In a normal perspective it’s 100% worth it for gaming and work. If you’re going for superficial things that will give you a premium feel. Then you won’t be completely satisfied. I’ve tried many mouses such as the Gpros, Glorious, etc. It definitely doesn’t compare when it comes to features and battery life. But what i mostly like is that it’s a bit over average ish. It’s better than 80% of the mouses that i’ve bought on Amazon. I know it’s an oddly eccentric and egregious claim but it’s way better than most of the cheaper mouse than this.. you can find.Cons:Well i just said i never really experience any issues with it. But I can presume and rule out some possible issues from a different person perspective. What others might think about it. I don’t have issues with connection problems but some might do depending on what monitor they use. For its cheap price, I would notice the plastic feel of it. But with the slightly above average contemporary features for a good deal. Again if you’re going for superficial like advanced settings, etc. Then your expectations are staggeringly out of place with its regressive appearance and performance. I would point out the sleep mode that occurs before a minute. Which shuts off the RGB, i mean it could bother some people who like to show off.Overall thought, this mouse in particular is better than a typical mouse. Way better than getting a mouse from your dad (if he’s cheap). But eh this is my overall opinion from my experience.

    Works perfect wired, a little small for my hand unfortunately. Nice colors and decent customization, no rgb sync with popular programs though. The latency is kinda annoying when I used it with the receiver, havent tried BTConstruction feels nice, buttons feel clicky enough

    The mouse is great. NO SOFTWARE. I had to dig deep into the web to find it. There is NO BATTERY INDICATOR. so you just use it until it's dead. Not very handy but whatever, the price was right.

    Bought this when my logitech G pro wireless mouse stop charging or would read the wrong battery percentage. Nothing like going into a game thinking its charged and dies.. Regardless I searched reddit and the solution was to bang the mouse down on a table, maybe the battery was loose or something (Ima go hard) and that seemed to fix it. I saw cases it would jump 30-50% in battery life. Tested it myself, It worked for me surprisingly. The logitech mouse started acting up again after about 3 months, so I decided I should at least test this first. In my opinion I think it comparable maybe identical. If you did a blind test they might pick this that is how close it is. I was concerned about the ms delay but I tested both and they benchmarked the same, granted my logitech is a bit older. I do run my monitor at 144hz so that could be a factor, but regardless I think it's just as good and it fits the hand perfect. Pretty smooth when on a mouse pad as well, maybe a tad more friction but feels nice and kind of helped the gaming elbow. I generally play at like 800-1200 DPI so 8000 is plenty. For reference I play mobas like league and fps games like cod. Windows mouse sense 10/20 seems to be the best. If your on the fence I think you should try it, I almost like mine better because the click is quiter. Thank you for your time.

    I have used this mouse both wired and wireless. It works well both ways. I use it wireless most of the time, but will have it wired when the battery runs out and is plugged in to charge. Battery life has been good.

    First off, it's important that I point out that I didn't buy this for gaming, but for daily work primarily so it's through those lens that I am reviewing this product. Also, I didn't install the software as I didn't want any additional bloat, but you will probably need it if you want more control of the colors and battery status etc. I have used it for a month or so to get a good feel for how it is.Now with that out of the way, some important things I wanted to mention about the mouse that weren't clear that might benefit others.- DPI or dots per inch affects the speed at which the mouse will move across the screen. If you are noticing very slow mouse movement (saw some reviews mention this), then increase the DPI and see if that gets you to something you like. The buttons are labeled in the manual. You can also try adjusting mouse speed in your OS (I'll leave that to you to figure out for your specific OS).- Report/polling rate affects the frequency at which the mouse communicates with the computer. In theory, the higher, the better accuracy, but also the greater drain on battery as it has to do more. Without the software, the rates correlate to color flashed on the scroll wheel when you set it using button on the bottom of the mouse. The rates allowed are 125 red/250 blue/500 green/1000Hz pink.Ok, so onto the pros:- Cost is fairly good. Considering you are getting a wireless mouse that can be plugged in and function as a wired mouse, it's fairly affordable.- Very accurate and I notice no lag with usage. I run at 250Hz poll rate (blue), though to be honest, I don't really notice any difference at 125Hz. Again, not gaming, so your mileage may vary, but give you can bump it up to 1000Hz, it should be adequate for most. I did confirm the poll rates online. You can google for sites that will report the detected poll rate of the mouse if you are interested in seeing it and from those sites, I did see the mouse was polling at the rates they claimed.- Rapid fire works as claimed and triggers 3 left mouse button clicks. I don't have a need for it so can't speak to how well it works in games or if the software allows any tuning of the rate at which it clicks 3 times, but there's no way to do it on the mouse itself.- Battery life is ok. I get roughly a week out of it using it for work. I have it on normal power on mode which means the LEDs are on so long as the mouse is actively getting used. I also use it on 250Hz polling for reference. LEDs go out after a minute and mouse goes to sleep after 5. The scroll wheel blinks red to let you know it is running low and will light up as stable green when fully charged (at least it is supposed to though it doesn't always do that but that may be related to the con listed later on about this).- Uses USB-C.- Wireless connectivity is stable. I use it 95% of the time wirelessly and only plug it in to charge and don't really notice any connectivity issues/lag.Cons:- It admittedly feels and looks cheap in some respects. The plastic feels very cheap. The scroll wheel looks probably the worst in that regards as just mostly plastic wheel that has a rubber tire or sorts on it. That said, the wheel feels and behaves fine for the most part and I care more about the function than the form so I don't necessarily care too much, but if you want something that looks premium, this probably won't do.- About that scroll wheel, it doesn't have horizontal tilt if you want to scroll left/right. That may or may not matter to you. For gaming, probably better it doesn't, but for normal work, I prefer having it so it was a bit of a let down for me.- LEDs are decent. They are RGB as you can see the same sections change color, unlike some that claim to be RGB but really only light up one color, but that said, you can see the individual sections. It doesn't look seamless as the colors transition down the mouse in some color modes making it very obvious where the different LED sections are. Probably would have required more LEDs to get the nicer affect, but it still looks fairly decent as a whole.- No way to keep the LEDs on. It turns off if it's idle and as I type most of the time rather than use the mouse, it is off a lot. For those who care about having it on all the time, just know that won't be possible.- Deep sleep after 5 mins is a huge annoyance. You have to scroll the wheel or click to re-wake it. While the other stuff I have listed is mostly superficial and I don't really mind at the end of the day, this 'feature' does bother me. I would prefer if it could wake on motion or something.- The charging/wire is a bit finnicky. I sometimes have to unplug and replug it multiple times for it to really make a good connection and get detected by the computer/charge. At first I thought I just wasn't seating it in all the way, but that was definitely not the issue. It also seems that it prefers having the plug go in with the cable flipped in a specific direction. Given this is USB-C and you shouldn't have to care which way it plugs in, so it adds to the cheap feel of the product. I might have gotten a defective component or something here, so you may have better luck with this. While annoying, it is still overall functional and not worth the headache of an exchange for me. I just put some tape on the usb cable to indicate the side it wants up and it works most of the time now when I plug it in that way. This alone probably cost it a star.- Ergonomics are a bit average for me, but that is hugely personal preference and depends on your anatomy so it's hard to knock it for that too much. I prefer a slight slant to the mouse with the left button a bit higher than the right to allow me wrist to rest in a more comfortable position, but that's not for everyone.Overall, for the price, you get a decent mouse. Most of the cons again are rather superficial, but if you are getting something like this with LEDs etc, the look and feel is what you are getting it for so the fact that it looks and feel slightly on the cheap side is a bit of a let down. I wouldn't discourage buying it necessarily for just that (probably docked it 1 start just for those things combined), and given a choice, I'd buy this mouse again if those were the only issues, but I get it if that is enough to make you say no. The bigger issue for me is the poor usb-c connection/port and the lack of wake up on motion.Hopefully this review helps you.

    First off, ""WOW!"" I do so love this gaming mouse from Redragon. This is the Ranger Lite M910-KS wired/wireless RGB gaming mouse in all its glory.Here's my thoughts in no particular order:1) The mouse has a great weight/balance ratio that's not difficult on the hand or wrist. I'm an average sized build guy but it just feels tight and right cradled in my hand. The texture of the grippy wheel and the ""clicky"" of the keys are a satisfying relief during extended use.2) The quality of materials used feels superb. The long, thick included USB-C cable for charging and/or wired play was a welcome addition. Feels like something most cell phone companies have no problem charging you $40 for..3) The free customization software (www.redragonzone.com) is simple to install and easy to use. It may not be the most in-depth customization tool I've ever seen but it certainly does the basics plus you can import/export profile layouts which is a handy feature for those migrating over to this little guy from another mouse.4) The RGB lights are very captivating and comes with 9 preset (mostly adjustable) motion styles. Some of the color shifts seem a tad sluggish depending on how you tweak them but that's me grasping for something neutral to have to add.5) The three buttons on the top of the mouse. Out of the box there are a set to control + & - DPI to one of 5 adjustable presets (250-8,000 with the optional software) with the third to cycle between lighting modes. To me, that's really all these buttons are good for as to where they're located.  Not for practical gaming use unless you have crazy carpel tunnel syndrome. You can always remap them for use as media controls and other things you won't be using on the fly often but that's three buttons i won't be using for gaming myself.6) So far the battery hasn't given me any reasons for concern. I read others complain about this very thing but from what all it's doing wirelessly I'm frankly impressed. Sometimes I think some people will just never be satisfied.  It comes with a charge cable.. CHARGE IT! You can charge the battery and still use the mouse while doing so as long as it's wired to a USB port on your PC.7) Speaking about connection, the Nano USB receiver that you use for wireless play is idiot-proof. Plug receiver into USB port, turn mouse On (or to ECO) and that's it! You're connected. No software needed for that. In fact, no software of any kind is required to use this versatile mouse. ONLY if you want to benefit from the extra customization options like remapping of the keys, colors, macros etc would you need the FREE software from Redragon.  Okay! So that my fellow geeks and gamers is my humble review of the Redragon Ranger Lite M910-KS RGB Mouse. Not the most elite thing out there, but for $29.99 with FREE Prime Shipping you simply can't beat this budget-friendly intro/advanced gaming mouse. It excels in what you really need out a mouse and gives you plenty of extras to have some fun with and make it your own. All in all it receives an ""A"" in my book!""Thank you, RD!""~Kali Alley Kat~

    If you keep it on Eco mode, it will last quite a while. If you don't, prepare to keep it charging every night. Don't want it to die in the middle of your next game.

    Pretty lights, decent batt life, game for days very long sessions no problem. only annoyance is you click to wake the mouse, and sometimes if you're hovering over something bad it will click it. Prob a way around that by right clicking to wake or something

    All features work well. The wireless and recharge is fantastic. The only reason for 4 stars is because the ergonomics are not quite as good as some other mouses I have but for a portable mouse it does the job well. Would recommened. Will update if I have issues.

    I was looking for a wireless RGB sleek looking white mouse and this was one of the only options that looked appealing at its price range. The color options are nice though I wish it was a bit brighter or showed more of the lights around the mouse but it’s still nice. It’s worth noting that I use this for my work computer not for gaming so I can’t speak on that. It gets the job done for what I use it for.

    When I going to buy something, I used to make a hard research in all internet about brands, hardware, benefits, disadvantages, you know everything about when one of us want to be advised. In this caseThis mouse gaming mouse, is powerful, It offers a lot of specs than others can offer respect its price, is cheap and good. But if the money isn't important to you, you could choose a premium brand, of course Redragon have premium series, but It is a great buy

    Great mouse to use on the ROG Ally and Steam Deck and I'm certain it'll work just fine with other handhelds. I'm using the Jsaux Dock Station 12-in-1 and it works as expected. It also has a great ergonomic feel to it. I had it setup where the light source on the mouse almost matches the ROG Ally lighting.

    I got this mouse because mine stopped working and I wanted to try a new brand that's also wireless. I was hesitant to get it because I was worried the charging would be an ordeal, but the battery life lasts forever. When it first came, I'm assuming it arrived fully charged which was great. I'd say it lasted near a week out of the box before I had to charge it. I've only had to charge it a few times since I've gotten it and you dont even have to charge it for very long. The only things I would criticize is that it feels a bit cheap, at least compared to my old mouse. It's very light feeling, and its easy to bend the plastic as when it arrived the clicker part was bent up onto the packaging and I thought it was broken. It was not broken, it snapped right back in place but I feel like that's worth mentioning if you're looking for something more heavy. The settings and colors are nice, the LEDS aren't consistent looking, I can see where they're placed but it doesn't bother me too much, it still lights up. overall it's a perfectly decent mouse and I'm satisfied given the price.

    So I’ve had this mouse about six months now and it still works like a charm but the lights have started to not work quite right . Not quite sure why either done A LOT of troubleshooting but just kinda seems like somethings not wired right . Other than that a very solid gaming mouse for price .

    Bought this to replace a 3 year old budget gaming mouse with a faulty CMOS sensor. Been using it for 5 or 6 days for general desktop use in eco mode and I still haven't had to charge it.Really just decent, all the way around. Won't compare to a top of the line mouse but it is better than most of the garbage out there, even mice costing twice as much.This is a really good alternative to something like a Logitech M720 for non-gamers because it is more precise and cheaper. It is also slightly lighter which will make a difference after 12 hours of video editing.

    I kind of wish it just took batteries. I have to charge this mouse every few days and I dislike having corded mice. It works well, and has plenty of colored lights to chose from

    I like this mouse quite a bit, but I'm a fan of colors and lights. It works pretty well and I don't have too much of a problem with it.Minor problems:Charge seems to not last a long as I was hoping for. I have to charge it every 4-5 days, though I do use it at least a few hours a day.Mouse is for larger hands. My thumb cannot reach one of the side buttons. Not really a negative, but something to consider for those with smaller hands.

    I'm coming from a Logitech G502 wired mouse which I've had for at least 7 years. It was a good mouse (obviously as it lasted a very long time) and was still functioning perfectly but I wanted a wireless for my gaming. And I absolutely loathe the Logitech software (so there's that).This Red Dragon is checking all the boxes so far, but I've had it less than a week.The one flaw I've found, and it's been mentioned in other reviews, is the sleep function. I don't mind that it sleeps but I would like to have a wake on motion function instead of a button click, which can affect your position depending on where that cursor happens to be when you click one of the three wake buttons. Maybe they can fix this on a firmware update. Maybe?

    Adjustable sensitivity is great for different uses (gaming/data analysis/work/etc). The material feels nice and doesn’t show oils or grease!

    I love how smooth the mouse is once it's connected. Playing fast paced games like Apex Legends and Overwatch with this mouse is great! The DPI settings fit my playstyle well, the RGB settings are gorgeous. There's only 1 downside that didn't show up initially. As advertised, charging the mouse does show a red glow in the middle wheel indicating that it's still charging and eventually green once it's fully charged. 3 weeks later once charging it, the red glow doesn't show up anymore but it does charge since I continuously used it without dying on me.Overall, great product but the charging indicator seems lacking eventually.

    The mouse is decent quality and works fine especially for the price point. However I have been unable to find the support software needed to program the buttons. While I'm able to use the default mappings it would have been nice to make some changes.

    This wireless mouse is a surprisingly great mouse and options that the higher priced mouses have for less price.

    The click on the mouse is beautiful I left typos when writing this review so I could go back and click on the word to fix it just to click the mouse more the side buttons work great and the colors are nice for the price i can't give anything less i would put more if i could. I have used it for gaming for a while now and I love it response is nice and the USB-C is a huge added bonus.
