    I just bought an Apple Watch Series 8 45mm and I don‚Äôt want anything to scratch the screen. I was hesitant at first as i like the aesthetic of the watch and didn't want to ruin it or make it look bulky. It fits great, ads a little bulk but nothing too bad as you can see in my pics. Definitely worth it for the added protection, cost is reasonable as well as there are 2 in the package. Also the touch screen works just fine no issues at all, that was another worry of mine but so far it‚Äôs been responsive as far as the screen goes.

    Works great for my Apple Watch SE 2nd Generation! I got my watch about a week ago and almost immediately noticed how much I bump it into things while it‚Äôs on my wrist. So, I got this product for peace of mind. It feels very sturdy, is easy to put on, and looks amazing! It doesn‚Äôt feel or look bulky at all.The reason I did not give 5 stars - there is one downside in terms of functionality. I wish the case didn‚Äôt cover up the crown button so much. I have found it to be a little bit more difficult to scroll with the case on. Perhaps if the case were slimmer or the hole for the crown were bigger, it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. Not a dealbreaker, but enough of an annoyance for it to be one of the first things I noticed when I put it on.Other than that small issue, I am satisfied with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone that owns an Apple Watch and wants a bit more protection than just a screen protector!

    I first bought these a couple of years back when I first bought my second Apple watch and now I can't imagine not having one on my watch. I got them for my parents and they like them too. I originally bought it because I didn't want my new watch getting beat up/scratched like my first watch did. While doing laundry I have bumped my watch so many times and this helps save it from scratching and getting beat up. I have replaced them a few times to try out different colors, and because after a while they get a little scratched. But hey I would much rather this get beat up / scratched than my actual watch. They are super durable and easy to put on which is nice. It's also fun because you can try different colors and it changes the color of the watch you have (but the screen part is still clear so you can see). Will repurchase again when needed.

    I found a pretty significant crack on the case today (I‚Äôve had it for some time now) and I removed it when I got home fully expecting to see at least some damage to the watch itself. The watch was completely undamaged, just like new. I replaced the broken case with the second case included in the box. It keeps the watch safe and clean, is easy to remove at attach, doesn‚Äôt interfere with functionality, and doesn‚Äôt interfere with any watch bands. I couldn‚Äôt ask for a better case and I‚Äôll definitely order another box to have on deck in case something happens.

    This save my new Apple Watch. My daughter shut the car door with my arm still there and it landed on the watch.  I was very upset to say the least because the screen was shattered.  One closer inspection, it was just the cover.  I was so relieved and very much believe in this product.

    I like the cover a lot and how easily it snaps on the watch. My only complaint is the moisture that gets in every time I wash my hands or handle something wet, you can see the bubbles on the edge of the watch screen. I pretty much have to take the cover off to dry off the moisture every time I get my hands wet, or take my watch off to avoid that from happening. Other than that it fits great and matches my watch nicely.

But with this tempered guardian, it remains unscathed, reflecting the villainous beams back to the abyss from whence they came. Its clarity is undiminished, its responsiveness untarnished ‚Äì a true testament to its protective prowess.But it‚Äôs not just the physical threats that this screen protector wards off. In a whimsical twist of fate, it seems to repel the more arcane dangers too.

    I bounce back and forth between 'soft' and 'tempered glass' screen protectors for my Apple Watch.  When I install a soft cover, I remember how much I liked the instant response and gentle touch needed to get a response.  I also like how the tempered glass face a lot more scratch resistant and a lot easier to keep clean.  And how it's so much easier to just clean the watch and snap on the new cover when the old one gets damaged.The soft cases are less prone to relatively catastrophic impact damage, something that happens once in a while while I work on things.  The last tempered glass one has three cracks in it, plus scratches at the top and bottom.  The last soft one had dulling/fogging face syndrome, part due to use and exposure, some due to age.  They seem to last me about a year or so.Conclusion:  I like these tempered-glass protectors better.  I'll suffer through the occasional crack or edge scratch, and buy the two-pack so I have a spare.  The real bottom line though is that every bit of damage, scratching, dirt, etc.  is use and abuse that the watch itself won't have to directly endure.  Simple as that.  It's protecting a much bigger investment, and certainly good and cheap insurance.  Did I mention that I like the harder tempered-glass face?

    After spending countless of hours reading through reviews and trying to figure out which case I should buy for my brand new Apple Watch S9, I decided on this one and I do not regret it one bit. As others have mentioned, some water does get into the case when you are washing your hands, but in my opinion, it is very minimal.Some reviewers mentioned that the case is hard to take off, but it's really not that bad to take the case off to wipe the water and put it back on. I also wash my hands very frequently throughout the day and since the water that gets into the case (barely noticeable) does not affect the sensitivity, I take the case off once a day before going to bed to wipe the very little water that got in it. 5/5 stars

    I'm a decently good boulder/climber and I wanted to get a case that would allow me to wear my apple watch and not worry about smashing or scratching my watch face. Wore it for the first time climbing today and honestly it was doing pretty well until I had to do this hard move and hit my wrist into the wall and fully cracked the protector screen in like 4 places. It didn't break off and stayed intact. So honestly, it did its job, but now my protector screen is cracked and I wouldn't really keep it on since running my fingers over the screen is now scratchy.I actually like the pink color so much that I would buy it again and just not wear my watch climbing again.

    Love this cover. My husband just informed meOur daughter scratched her Apple Watch. But I took a look and thankfully I had this cover on it, and it cracked or broke the cover but her watch screen was fine! I had also bought an Otterbox watch cover to compare but it came with no clear covering, just a ‚Äúbumper‚Äù. I‚Äôm so glad I used these covers over the otterbox one. I‚Äôm also glad there are 2!One thing I‚Äôd change or wish for, is that the area around the Digital Crown and side button were thinner because it‚Äôs harder to manipulate those things. That‚Äôs the only reason I gave it 4 stars.

    I am still rocking my Apple Series 3 Watch and this is a great protection solution for that watch. I do a lot of manual work and tend to be rough on my watches. I will try to provide some future updates to how this case stands up to my punishment. I purchased the black case in combination with the SUNFWR black metal watch band and it doesn't obstruct the new watch band. It looks like a new watch and matches perfectly with the black metal watch band. When installed, I found the touch controls to be very smooth and response and much better than my previous plastic film screen protector. Overall, I'm very happy with this case/screen protector combo.

    I just started using my Apple Watch again. I had a case on it that was pretty used and beat up. When I took it off, my Apple Watch could pass as new (not a scratch to the gold part or screen). I then used it for week without a case. While I loved the look of my watch (sleek, clean, and minimal), I still felt scared to get a scratch on it so I decided to buy a case. I was stuck between the black and clear. I am so glad I went with the CLEAR option! It allows me to clearly see the gold color of my watch and doesn‚Äôt take away almost at all from the original look. It isn‚Äôt bulky in my opinion and I‚Äôm so glad I made this purchase!

    I recently purchased the Apple Watch Ultra 2 ,and I purchased A different band for my watch which came with a case as well. The issue with that case was that the sensitivity of touching the screen was hard to do any typing on. I remember purchasing this brand for my Apple Watch SE And it worked beautifully. Not only protected my watch the touchscreen was flawless so once I found they made one for the Ultra 2 Watch I bought it the same day. As just Like before, the touchscreen is beautiful and flawless when typing any thing on it. I prefer this screen protector over any screen protector that Amazon has on their website‚Ä¶.

    Yes - does everything they claim, it's easy to install, excellent protection, and touch functionality is very good...Only complaint is if you get it wet, as in wear watch in shower, water WILL get between the cover and the watch screen - not huge issue since it's so easy to pop off and dry, then reinstall... just remember it'll happen.I have now gotten where I don't wear the watch in shower, got tired of popping it off to dry out.Will try it in the pool soon and see how bad that does... expecting it to be much worse.So bottom line is, if you wear your watch in shower or swim with it, you probably don't want this...

    I dropped my watch that was hanging off of a towel hanger in my bathroom from about 4 feet. I picked it up, saw the screen was all cracked and was thinking the worse. It turns out it was only this rock hard, super protective case on my watch that was cracked! My watch was left undamaged, clean, and looking new. The case did its job ü´° I‚Äôm thankful two come in one pack so now I can just put another one on. Definitely buying another set if my 2nd one does their job again

    These are great to put over your watch to protect it, but if you sweat a lot during workouts or you have your hands around water, it gets trapped in there making it almost impossible to tap anything until you remove the cover and fully dry both the watch and the inside of the cover. Despite that, the cover was great protection during my craft projects.

    Case works great, I bump my wrist on doorways a good bit and this has definitely held up well in keeping my watch face safe. I purchased the pink color about a month ago and am sad to see a lot of the pink around the screen is chipping away. I would expect this over time but definitely not at the rate at which it‚Äôs happening which is why I went for 4 instead of 5 stars. It does its job just wish the color wasn‚Äôt fading away.

    This is a good screen protector but be careful if you get water or condensation under the screen.  I was panicking that my apps didn‚Äôt respond to touch until I realized there was a tiny film of water preventing adequate contact.  After I removed the screen protector and cleaned it, everything worked fine again. Overall I am happy with the protection.

    I am so thankful I had this. It saved my watch.  Bought it for my son to help prevent issues but since it came with two, I put the extra on mine. Was in the yard this weekend, just happened to swing my arm at the wrong time and hit my watch on the corner of a brick. I heard the crack and looked down. The shield was cracked but the watch was fine. Had I not had it, I would have been out a lot of money!!! Ordering a replacement now!

    I purchased this set back in Nov 2023 and last week, I finally broke the protective glass on the remaining protector. For $10 protection lasting 5 months of the brutality of moving, jumping in/on/out/from motorcycle, airplanes, hiking, and working out, I would've liked to past 6 months, to be realistic, bonus if a year, before needing another set. Due to my active lifestyle, the protective case does pop out randomly, easy to snap back into place though. Once water gets between the glass and the watch, you'll have to wipe dry surfaces to get back to touching capability.

    This watch protection device seems to be an answer to my klutziness!  So far it has worked to keep my watch screen intact even with fairly hard bumps.  It was a little tight to snap on - I was afraid it was going to break - but it did not and comes off easily as well.  Pack of two.

    These are so worth it.

    there is nothing bad to say about this product. I wish I had found this sooner. To have something as easy as this with tempered glass to protect the Apple Watch screen is amazing. I've used other ones that have just had plastic coverings. They work in durable, but not nearly as much as this.

    Was delivered promptly and the package contained all products. The cover works well, better than one I had previously bought, as far as touch screen goes. I can't speak to how durable it is yet but I have found that most watch covers in this price range usually only hold up for 1-2 good hits; if this one does more than that I will be 100% satisfied.

    This is pretty easy to install and will do a great job protecting my watch, however you almost want to remove this every time you shower or doing dishes because water gets trapped underneath it. It's also not as touch sensitive so I'll catch myself frequently having to carefully touch it but think I'll eventually get used to that.

    Ordered this for my daughter who broke her watch screen. Once she got it repaired she ordered this but told me it was very hard for her to use her watch. Touching the screen has to be touched with much greater force and water constantly gets under it from her washing her hands. (I saw this in several reviews and thought people were swimming with it. Once she showed me how water got under it, it was very understandable why a lot of reviews said the same thing.) Wish there was a better way for water to not get under it so easily.

    Is not water proof. However after only wearing it over my watch, I was pushed against a door way in a crowded area. My instinct was to stop me from falling. As you can see, the cover cracked yet saved my watch.

    I love the color and how easy it snaps on and offHowever it does get water in between the case and the face of the watch while showering etc. It will cause your watch to be untouchable until wiped off

    This Apple Watch protector is a must buy for those who are a little clumsy. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve dinged my watch on some corner of something and every time the protector protects it so well!! Not even a scratch after dropping it on the floor!! Highly recommended

    Great product overall.  It performs as it should; however, I got water under it (twice) and had to remove the cover so the screen could make positive contact with the screen and when I was putting it back on the second time, the protector cracked.  It still works and performs as advertised, and I had bought two.  Great product for those who are accident prone, just be careful getting water under it and removing the casing.  I'd buy again.

    I have purchased these a few times due to being clumsy and always banging my watch off doorways and desks etc. It has protected my watch from damage. Wouldn‚Äôt wear my Apple watch without these. :) Highly recommend

    I was at the gym today when I lost my balance with 135lbs on my shoulders. I smashed my watch into the bar hook shattering the tempted glass and with the force I thought my watch too. NOPE! My watch was perfectly fine and didn‚Äôt even have a scratch on it. The glass case had a hole in it and that‚Äôs why I thought my watch was totaled. This product saved my watch and a painful call to Apple care. The nice part is I came home and install the second one that it came with, so it‚Äôs fully protected again. So, I have just brought another pack, because, well I‚Äôm a clumsy Mfer lol.

    This really protects the Watch and didn‚Äôt add bulk. Maybe it‚Äôs me but you did have to press a tad bit harder to get things to pop up. Since I‚Äôm new to Apple Watch‚Äôs it may be not touching a smaller app.

    I am surprised at how often I bang the face of my Apple Watch against random objects, so I am glad to have this protector for it! Easy to install and the touch screen works perfectly. It has taken a relative beating from my clumsy self and shows no wear. I'd buy it again!

    This case is the best so far, the case is very protective so much so that even when I fell of my scooter going 15.5 mph the case cracked but the Apple Watch was untouched. The case is very touch sensitive. Overall really good!

    I got this cover for scratches, but it ended up saving my watch when I dropped it face first to tile. The cover took the crack, and my watch was perfectly safe underneath. So freaking grateful!!!! I love this thing and glad I went for this cover.It‚Äôs also pretty low profile and the screen is responsive to touch. Great product.

    I have been using the Misxi transparent case on my 45 mm Apple Watch 8 since it was new in December.  It has provided great protection.  I am not been too tough on my watch, but have occasionally hit it on walls or doors.  The case has protected the watch without cracking or scratching after two months of use.I've seen some reviews mentioning that water gets underneath the case.  It is my understanding that the case isn't intended to be waterproof and only protects from scratches.  I never submerge my watch in water and, therefore, have had no issues.  If water got under the case, it is fairly easy to remove to allow for drying.

    I‚Äôve tried some others that would fall off easily when caught by something, but this one has stayed on and doesn‚Äôt allow water to seep in. I like the black color too - matches my black leather wristband and kinda gives my Ultra a stealth look!

    They fit snug and so far have protected well. Buy them if you need to protect your apple watch from people like my wife who are careless and sometimes damage things accidentally.

    These are perfect for those like myself who somehow always bang their watch on something. It has a sticky part that sticks to the screen so it‚Äôs harder to come off.

    I just opened this to put it on my watch and the wet wipe was dry. I‚Äôve purchased this in the past and not had a problem. Also, as a note to others, water seeps into the case when swimming or showering and makes it almost impossible to use the touch screen unless you remove the case and dry the watch face and inside of the protector. Other than that it works perfectly. Obviously I don‚Äôt have a problem with that as I bought it again.

    This is excellent for daily use and work settings. It serves as a safeguard for your Apple Watch in addition to protecting the device itself. Fortunately, I have a backup screen protector in case I need to replace the one I have damaged up!

    Comes with screen cleaner and 2 covers.  Unfortunately, my watch is the larger size so they are too small to fit my apple watch.  Check your screen size it's on the back of the watch!

    I like the watch face protector, but they do pop off very easily, and I‚Äôve had to go through several. If you buy it, just make sure you order a couple extras because you‚Äôre gonna lose them.
