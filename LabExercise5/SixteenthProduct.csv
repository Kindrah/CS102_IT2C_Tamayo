"1","Switch Accessories Bundle - Orzly Essentials Pack for Nintendo switch Case & Screen Protector, Grip Case, Games Holder, Headphones - Classic Black Edition","Luciano Carneiro","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2019","







  
  
    I'll go over each item individually but let me give you the TL:DR review up top. This is a great product and a bargain considering the price. The travel case, comfort grip, and screen protectors alone make this worth buying. If you're just just starting out with you Switch this is a great jumping off point. I looked a several bundles but a lot of them just looked cheap and poorly made. The moment I saw the packaging I knew that this was higher quality. Now to go over every item:Stylus pen - Super light, not the reason anyone got this. Feels cheap but it's just something that was thrown in, doesn't really matter. It stays in my case and I've used it once or twice, whatever.USB C Cable - Good thing to have but haven't used it all the mach. I'm scared to plug my Switch into anything that not the dock but could be useful if you get a pro controller.Cartridge Case - I have my games in it, it's pretty small and fits in the case. Feels durable, I prefer using it than the game sleeves in the case itself.Portable Headphones - I've used these every time I've played my switch in portable mode. They work well, are very comfortable, good length, and since the switch doesn't allow you to connect bluetooth headphones to it this came in handy because it's the only 3.5mm headphone jack in my home. Don't sleep on this item.Screen protectors - I don't really know how to tell a good from bad screen protector but this one felt like it was good quality. I really appreciated that it was a 2 pack (a lot of these bundles only come with 1) and that it came with instructions, a micro fiber cloth, and 2 alcohol wipes all the tools needed to install.Comfort Grip Case - I couldn't imagine playing the switch on portable mode without this. It's so much more comfortable holding the switch with it. As far as protection I'm sure if it fell on it's back this would help but on the screen the sticks are doing all the work. It's also compact enough to fit in the case. Getting the system out is a little annoying and you can't dock the switch with it on, that might be a problem for some people, doesn't bother me because I assumed you wouldn't be able to anyway.Travel Case - Overall I'm quite satisfied with this case. I use it everyday to store my switch accessories. When my Switch is docked the grip case is in here along with the wrist straps and all smaller items. It'll definitely protect your Switch. My one complaint is that you can't remove the flap with the cartridge slots. When there are no games in the slots I actually like having it there as an extra layer of protection between your screen and the items in the case but when there are cartridges in the slot it can get quite bulky and actually minimizes how many things you can put in the case. Because of it's size and storage capacity it isn't the most compact case so I will eventually purchase a different one for a more on the go needs.

    TLDR: Great bundle and no major complaints. Best part is the grip.I bought this because it's the only bundle that had a ergonomic grip instead of a standard case. I thought the grip would be flimsy but it's actually very durable rubber (doesn't bend easily). The one I got didn't have the saggy rubber issue around the charging port area that other people spoke about. I like that the carry case has indentations to fit the switch with the grip case attached. The screen protector was a bit tedious to install, but it fits perfectly and has no bubbles. A bit pricey, but def worth it.Pros:- The ergonomic grip case is easily the best thing about this bundle. The matte material feels great to hold, and I didn't have an issue with the saggy rubber by the charging port like other people did.- The carry case is durable and sleek looking.- The net on the inside of the case can hold a lot of accessories. It can easily hold an extra pair of joy cons, a charging cable, earphones and still have some room to spare.- The stylus pen came in handy for playing ""Thimbleweed Park"", which is mostly touch based.- The Screen Protectors are great quality.Cons:- The elastic on the net on the inside of the case has too much slack between it and the back of the case, which means occasionally small items from the net can fall out when you open the case. This isn't necessarily a dealbreaker since it can be fixed with a little velco.-Unlike the other Orzly bundles, this one does not include grip caps for the analog sticks.

    The accessories and travel case are nice, but the real standout in the set is the Switch case.  The case makes the Switch more stable when using the stand and the system much more enjoyable to play overall as the grips are more ergonomic. Extended game play is more enjoyable with the grips!

    The case is very well made and I am glad that the additional grip that came with it fits the switch and both fit in the case comfortably. The acessories are hit or miss, but I dont really need the headphones or stylus pen, but they are nice additions.The screen protector fits as expected, but i did have some issues with a bubble on the side. I have had this issue with other tempered glass protectors, so it just may be me.The grip on the switch feels nicely. I do get a little nervous taking it on and off, specifically over the top bumpers, but once it is on it is nice and snug. As other reviewers posted, there is a slight curve of the rubber on the bottom of the switch, but it doesnt really impede gameplay, just a style issue.Overall this was a great purchase and I would reccomend to anyone looking for an affordable accessory pack.

    The comfort case is a must-have. It makes the console feel so much better. The switch has this tiny defect in my opinion: the joycons can feel a bit lose sometimes, which is understandable because they are made to be removed. But still, with the case everything feels so much solid and so comfy in the hands, your hands won't get tired.The screen protector is amazing, nothing can scratch it. And if you are careful you can get 0 bubbles easily.The carrying case is sturdy but easy to carry, you can put a ton of things inside it. Pretty impressed with the quality.The headphones are just regular headphones, nothing crazy, but they are nice.What I wasn't expecting was the pen to be so cool. Is super slim, pretty and it works both in the switch and as a regular pen.The USB charger is perfect for planes, and it was one of the main reasons why i purchased this bundle. The little game holding box is fine. But it seemed a bit of an overkill considering that the case already has pockets, I guess is fine if you only want to carry 2 games.In general, I recommend this bundle a lot. The value is crazy high.

    With all that this comes with, and for the price it's at, this is the best deal out there.PROS: it comes with so much. A plastic game case which holds 4 cartridges, a stylus, some earbuds (I haven't used them yet), as well as a charging cord, and of course, the console case and carrying case. It's all made of good quality (doesn't feel like it's going to fall apart).CONS: The carrying case has a mesh pocket on the inside to hold all the things that come in the case, however, this is oriented upside down when carrying the case by the handle -- the result is that everything falls out of the pocket. It would have been a better design to either have a zipper across the top of the pocket, or just orient the pocket correctly, but still it's only a minor inconvenience as I don't put too much in the pocket to begin with.The plastic console case/shell is pretty good, though it does fit a little tight, and needs to be removed in order to dock the console to the docking station. Again, not a huge inconvenience as I only put the shell on when I take it out of the house, but getting it on and off is a little tedious and I'm a bit wary because it feels like a wrong move could damage some of the joycon buttons.Overall, this whole package is less money than other cases which only come with one simple carrying case. For me, the carrying case plus the shell made it worth it, and all the other throw-ins just add to how great this package is. 10/10 would buy again and recommend to others!

    This carrying case is exactly what you're looking for. It holds all the accessories that I have and it's small enough to fit in my backpack and still keep my switch safe. I did drop it on concrete once already and everything inside was fine, it didn't even scuff the outside material. I'd say it's pretty good quality. BUT I have the new OLED switch and the screen protector this comes with IS NOT for the OLED switch. This screen protector fits the first Gen switch only.

    Ive been using this kit for the past few months and overall im happy with it despite the few flaws it has.The case itself is durable and the carrying handle is a nice touch. The game card holder holds games nice and snug so i know my games arent going anywhere, and the mesh pocket is a nice touch to hold anything extra. The usb-c cable is a nice touch too.The glass protectors were a huge plus for me as I just bought my switch when I got these.The grip case is really my only issue with this kit, and why I dont give it a 5 star rating. Don’t get me wrong it pops on the switch amazingly and feels really nice to hold but it has a bow effect at the bottom of the case that makes it not so “aesthetically pleasing”. But otherwise it does its job as intended and the switch itself fits nice and snug in the carrying case with the grip on. Keep in mind you can’t dock the switch with it on though.Lastly this kit included a 4 game case and a pen with a touch pad tip on top to use for the switch’s touch pad. I don’t use the pen for the switch but it writes nicely on paoer so hey thats something lol. The game case is nice, its small and the design is interesting so ill end up making use of it for when i want to bring extra games while traveling.I would recommend this carrying case for anyone looking for a starter kit

    The orzly switch accessories bundle was certainly a worthwhile bargain, with a few minor faults.First, the case: while not the most compartmentalized and study of cases, the case provided in this bundle is firm, able to store games, the switch (even in the grip), and multiple cables.Next, the screen protectors—by far my favorite part of this bundle. While requiring finesse to install, instructions are clear and you are provided with a cloth, alcohol wipe, a second screen protector, and multiple sets of instructions.Lastly, the add-ons, which add a significant bonus to this already worthwhile bundle: the 2-in-1 stylus pen. While it looks simple, it feels great and works efficiently without smudging and is both a quality pen and stylus for the price.  The headphones, while somewhat uncomfortable and unbalanced in sound, get the job done. Lastly, the usb-c connector and slimline cartridge holder, while not required overall, are great to have.  I, personally, opt to put my most used games in the slimline cartridge holder, and I bring along a power bank compatible with the connector, which has afforded me many extra hours of game time.Overall, this bundle is quite the bargain.Pros:- Good Case- Great Screen Protectors- Good Comfort Grip- Decent Added BonusesCons:- Subpar Earbuds- Comfort Grip Installation DifficultiesI’d say this bundle was a great purchase for my son, and he’s really enjoyed both his switch and this bundle—it’s saved much space and time on many trips!

    All items were in the package according to the product description. There were no damaged pieces. My grip case fit perfectly. I know some people had a grip case that was damaged, but mine wasn't. The one piece of equipment that madebthis bundle worth getting, IMO is the grip case. The only thing that could be added to the bundle that would make this totally ""self-sufficient"" would be a plug. I have a million of them lying around but some people might not. Adding the plug now you can charge when you're somewhere with your case & enclosed equipment. Since the power plug that comes with the switch is more of a permanent type, meaning you can't d/c the cord from the plug, having an extra plug, one for your case & then the one for your home set-up makes this bundle equipped for my purposes. I haven't tried the ear plugs yet. I do like the stylus/pen and the extra case to put a few extra game cards in.I would have to say that for the price of this bundle compared to the quality of the items they hit it out of the park & if you're on the fence, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS BUNDLE!!

    The sleeve does not fit the Switch Oled, the screen protector somewhat fits the Oled. The only things that I'm about to use in this kit is the storage case and screen protector. For $35 I could have went to game stop, and/or game exchange and got a really nice storage case and decent screen protector. Lesson learned I guess.

    If you love your switch & you want to protect it this is a great package deal to get. I got when it was on sale so even better.The carrying case itself is the most well designed case over ever seen very well made its industrial grade I’ve dropped the case on accident from about 5ft & not a dent or scratch or anything on the case...oh & the switch is fine too of course it would be cause on the inside not only do you have 2 little straps that hold your switch in place you also have the game holder in the center of the case which I do not use for game as most of mine are digital but that little middle game holder also acts as a screen protector while stored in the case so none of your gadgets in the pretty big pocket area of the case can mess up your screen. & ontop of that you also get 2 screen protectors which I haven’t used yet cause I already have 1 on my switch so I can’t say much about the screen protectors, & some headphones which seem pretty good still have not used them so can’t say anything about those ether, & there’s the plastic game card case which is nice & then a charge cable also nice & then there’s the pen/stylus which is also very nice it can also be used on your iPhone as well as the switch.

    The seller said in an email that a certain phrase would make them smile, so to brighten their day: ""2-3 words!""All seriousness though, while you can get a leather looking case at gamestop or walmart right off the shelf, this things bloody incredible! Comes with all you want, the glass, game holder, wall plug for any USB (which for road trips or boats, just grab a 12v plug)My biggest gripes are the protective case for the switch itself. The handholds are great , but are a royal pain taking it in and out every time I want to dock it. And the design for the case is too plain. If there were a design or something to say which side is up or the front it would make it easier to not flip the switch or if you're the kind to flip open lids the switch does not hit the table.It wont leave the case if you do that though, the elastic straps hold it in snugly with the case and switch inside so...theres that.Honestly, just for the case and glass you've already saved a ton and the rest is just the sweet icing on a delectable and sweet dessert. I'm happy with it and am debating sewing a patch to the case as it feels like hardened leather, but it's hard foam,  which will make things a little easier :P

    Purchased this primarly for the cover and screen protector but thought all the other accessories was good for the price point. The major issue for me is the game card slot is totally offset so I am unable to open the game slot to put in or take out games from the switch. I have to completely take off the cover everytime I want to play a new game. This completely defeats the purpose of the  protective cover if I have to expose the console everytime I want to put in a new game. Also, this affects the ability to extend the rear stand from opening and propping up the switch.  I've tried manipulating the cover to no avail it simply wont line up. Very disapointed.

    This product is not what I was expecting. I was expecting a poorly, cheaply made product to just tide me over till I eventually get something better.I was totally wrong!Everything in this box was of really good quality, from the case to the accessories. I've heard some people saying the rubber case has problems, but mine fit perfectly and with no defects. It fit totally perfect. Not only that, but it fits perfectly in the outer case, which was also of good quality. In fact, the outer case was as good as; if not, better than the official Nintendo one. The Type C cable was felt very durable, and as somebody who works with all type of electronics daily, I can tell you this was exceptionally well made for the price. I have not put on the screen protector yet, and I don't have any games to see if the game case holds it well, but so far, very good!Oh, by the way, I heard some people complaining about the headphones, well, my headphones came with a mic, and a button to I suppose play/pause. The headphones were also pretty good, though I will use my own, I leave them in the case just in case I need them if I have forgotten mine.10/10 for quality to price!

    I got a Nintendo Switch for Christmas and very quickly realized that I needed a way to carry it around, as well as a better way to hold it when I was using it as a handheld.  I looked at a number of options, but the Orzly bundle seemed to fit what I wanted, without a lot of extras I would never use.  My case has been perfect, and while I thought the method to hold the Switch seemed to simple at first, it works great as a quick way to get your game out and in to the case.  The pen works great too, and the cartridge holder was perfect.The only thing I was less thrilled about was the ""comfort grip"" case for using handheld. While it made it slightly better to hold, I could not put the game into the case with that on, nor was it comfortable for me, as it added extra weight.  This was a personal reaction though, as I have seen others enjoy that well.The screen protectors are great and overall, this was a perfect package for me. I highly recommend it.

    I think this is an awesome value. You receive the essential accessories required for a new Nintendo Switch owner. The travel case is very sturdy, practical, and light in weight. The screen protector can be a little tricky to apply, but if you take your time it's not bad at all. The headphones aren't world-class, but they're comfortable and produce a quality sound for extended use on the Nintendo Switch. I was surprisingly pleased with them. The game cases are a nice touch as well. They'll offer good storage and protection for game cards. The USB-C cable seems to be of good quality, as far as a reliable cable goes.My only significant gripe is the the protective rubber case that covers the console. While it is of good quality and it has a highly comfortable feel in the hands, there is a slight defect that I find pretty annoying.The protective case bows out at the bottom of the console, right near the center (see images). This might not be a major issue for functionality, but it does affect the aesthetics (other reviewers have experienced this as well). When you spend money on a product, you expect 100% quality, and unfortunately Orzly misses the mark here. Some may find it minor, but Orzly doesn't accept a partial payment for their products, so why should the customer accept any compromise on quality (regardless of how marginal it may be)?The defective protective case led me to an overall 3-⭐ rating. I find it a nuisance to have a reminder of this defect every single time I use the console. If I had received a protective case free of defects, this would easily be upgradeable to a 5-⭐ review.

    This is a steal of a deal for the case and screen protectors alone everything else is an added bonus. The case may not be as high of quality as the official ones from Nintendo but it is still constructed well and the material is nice as well. The case is durable enough for me to entrust it to protect the switch from my kids. The screen protector went on easily and looks just as good as the other one I bought previously that cost me $14 for one protector and this comes with two. While it is a pain to take any of the back cases for a switch on and off so you can utilize your docking station this one slides on and off fairly easily and while the rubber feels cheap it does make a huge difference in comfort holding your switch and as an extra was a nice surprise. Along with a usb charging cable so you dont have to use the bulky power cord that came with the switch makes this package a perfect deal to get.

    The case in itself comes with a pouch that can hold 8 games plus a travel case for an extra 4, for a total of 12 games on the go.The comfort grip case provides a glove-like fit to the switch and has grips on the bottom for a more comfortable play experience and protectionIt does come with a usb-c charging cable but the charging block is not includedThe Headphones are personally not my cup of tea because I don't like the ""Jellies"" but its there for convenience and quality of lifeIts always nice to have an extra screen protector when the first one breaks then the provided Microfibre, Squeegee, and Alcohol Wipes make the application process a breeze and very forgiving of mistakesalso it comes with a cool stylus for your switch and i hate fingerprints of screens-espeacailly on used for gamesoverall 10/10 product and i will be buying from this company should the need arise.However the carrying case and comfort grip do seem sturdy enough and cant say much about durabilty because i have yet to drop it

    I needed a travel case and a screen protector for my new Switch, so I bought this bundle. So far, everything has been working perfectly.The tempered glass screen protectors have been great so far. They're nigh-invisible when applied, barely pick up any smudges or dust, are super easy to clean, and don't affect touch controls for as much as I've seen. I accidentally damaged the edge of my first one when I tried to pull it off to readjust, but that was all my bad because I tried to pry it off with my thumbnail. Honestly, that speaks more positively to how solidly the screen protector seals to the screen. I didn't flub my second try, and it looks great - no issues with bubbles or peeling.I know this is something really minor, but I appreciate that the pen's stylus is opposite to the actual pen tip. So many manufacturers think they're being clever by combining the two on the same end, but there have been times when I've accidentally smacked my tablet with the pen tip extended. This is a nice idiot-proof pen/stylus.

    So I was a little nervous seeing all the weird bending cases and faulty things in this kit from other people, But it was the only kit that serious has everything you need to get started. And I have no complaints at all!!Everything and I mean everything in this package was 100% perfect in working condition! I’m even surprised at how much I like the headphones!I also suck at putting on tempered glass screens and for some reason this was just so easy. Everything looks so protected and perfect! And now when I move from my bedroom on the 3rd floor to my living room On the 1st floor, I can take everything in one go with ease! Haha sadly that’s the farthest traveling I’ll be doing :(Anyway! I hope this review helps when deciding to get this. Worst comes to worst and it’s defective you can easily send it back for free? That would suck but I’m glad I took the risk on this.

    I got this pack for my brother for Christmas.  He had just recently gotten a Switch, yet didn't have anything to protect it if he was going to go on any trips.  I remember from our childhood that if he had a handheld like a GameBoy, he'd take it nearly everywhere.I got this for him as it looked like a good starter kit that I wish were around when I first purchased my Switch at release.  Most of what is included was what I hunted up separately back then.  I think the best items are the case with game holders, the screen protectors, and the large handheld grip sleeve.  The other items in the pack, while nice little additions, he barely uses.  He does like the headphones as well!  Worked great on a recent 6 hr train trip.  Not a bad starter bundle for someone looking to protect a Switch in travel.

    This pack comes with a well made case, a comfortable grip, two screen protectors and an assortment of other useful items. I have found all components of the pack to be well made. I would highly recommend this pack. I give the product a four out of five, however, for two reasons. One is that the grip for the switch prevents it from fitting into the dock, and is a pain to get on and off. I find myself not using it because of this, even though I would like to. The second is that the screen protectors are difficult to get on without dust or air bubbles. I followed the steps provided, but still had to dispose of my first protector because it got dust and hair on it after my third attempt to get it on the screen without a bubble. The protectors are stiff, which signals their durability, but this is what makes them difficult to place on the screen.

    This is great for my Switch. Nice carrying case and a cover to hold the console easier. The only that would make it better is if I didn't have to remove the cover from the Switch to put it in the dock. Other than it's great for the price.

    Love this product. You get so much for such a great price. Two screen protectors that are easy to put on, the case itself is great size, not too big (not bulky) or too small (no storage space). It is the perfect size. The game cartridge holder is a nice touch. The headphones are not very good but they work and are a nice addition to have on the go in case of emergency. The grip is amazing. It makes gaming in handheld mode fun. The grip has a strange finish on it so the texture is off putting a little bit. Also, if the grip is on the switch it will not fit in the charging dock. Those are two bummers, but all and all it really didn't bother me too much. I would buy this 100 times over again. I have written about 3 reviews on things in my life so this should tell you how great of a product it is.

    The description said it was for OLED Switch but some things, such as the screen protectors, were for other models.

Everything came in great condition, I was worried from other reviews about the warped grip case but it’s not as bad as it’s made out to be. I easily bent it slightly in the opposite direction and it looks/fits fine, as seen in the pictures/video. The earbuds, stylus, and charger are all in working condition as well. And the carrying case is great, I have more digital games than physical so right now i’m just using the gray game card case but the slots in the carrier are neat too. Overall 10/10 would recommend

    El case se siente de buen material, rígido y protege bien contra el polvo, los audífonos compelen su función, el lapizcero capacitivo es bueno (aunque me pregunto que haré cuando se le termine la tinta jajaj), en le caso del cable de cara usb no lo he usado al igual que el porta cartuchos (todos mis juegos son digitales), la funda al igual que como en los demás comentarios lo mencionan si tiene un pequeño desperfecto en la parte de abajo (en donde es ta el conector tipo C) pero es muy leve en lo personal no me molesta no afecta.El protector de pantalla es muy bueno, facil de colocar y las instrucciones son muy detalladas asi que no te preocupes si es la primera vez que pones uno te ira bien, solo una recomendación, si tienes mascotas que no este cerca al momento de la colocación.

    I can always count on Orzly. When I bought my lite, i ordered their set. Now that I have my OLED, I went through them again, and they did not disappoint.

    I bought this bundle to take the Switch on vacation, and it really came with everything we needed. The glass protector fit perfectly and was easy to put on, plus it came with a second one just in case something happens to the first one. The comfort grip fits nicely around the Switch and does make it easier to hold, plus I feel more comfortable letting the kids play in handheld. And the Switch fits inside the travel case with the comfort grip attached.The travel case has a pouch that's big enough for an extra pair of Joy Cons, plus all four straps, and the other accessories that came with the bundle (headphones, stylus and charging cord). I wasn't able to fit the Joy Con grip in the pouch, but that doesn't really need to be protected by a travel case.This is the bundle to buy if you're wanting to travel with the Switch.

    The case is great, and some of the accessories are too. The screen protector went on easily and looks great, and the mini case for games is useful.I had to knock off a star for the quality of the headphones and stylus. Though the stylus/pen has some weight to it so as to not feel extremely cheap, I question its usefulness given the Switch screen does not require one. The headphones have OK sound quality, but at least on my pair, they crackle if you move the cable. Slightly disappointing. I have not used the USB cable yet so I can't comment on that. The grip is comfortable but a huge pain to put on/take off.Overall it's not a bad batch of accessories and definitely a good price for what you get.

    Got this for my son and he couldn't be happier.  First, its an incredible value.  The comfort grip case alone is worth the $30.Warning - DO NOT try to put your switch back in the dock with the comfort grip on!  It will destroy your dock!The case is excellent with convenient places for everything while protecting your system.  Honestly with the grip on and your switch strapped into the case, you would have to put effort into damaging your Switch.  If you are just looking for a case to move your Switch, there are better (smaller) solutions than this.  But if you primarily use your Switch in mobile mode, you cant beat this package.  it keeps your stuff together while protecting it and making it easier to play.  Cant ask for more than that!

    I bought this I guess on sale or something for $20 which I recognized is an absolute steal for it. It comes with a lot and everything you need as an accessory for a switch in travel. I like it, the quality I am having no doubts as of yet. I was paranoid of dropping my switch, which has never happened, but w/e.My only critique in desiring a more perfect product is the ability to take off the cover easier, because I worry about the bending of it on controls and weakening them or damaging them over time. It seems to be a bit ""too snug"" when trying to get it off in order to dock it. I love the grip design though it offers. You can't dock with this cover on, but that was not a big factor in my purchase at the time.

    I was originally planning to buy all of these items separately then I found this bundle and opted for it instead. I am very pleased with all of the items that came with this bundle. The case is very, very nice with lots of space inside for pretty much any and all items except the docking station itself. It even came with a little pen you can use on the screen. I would definitely recommend this bundle to any of my friends who have or are getting a Nintendo Switch in the future.The only thing I don't like is that the grips can't stay on the back of the Switch when it's on the docking station because it's too thick. This isn't really anything to do with the item itself though, which is extremely nice and comfortable to use!

    I was looking for a phone wallet case for razor 1 and there were so few choices but i landed on this one since it had good reviews. I ended up buying the razor 2 which orzly didnt have a wallet case for on amazon. So i pulled up the orzly website and they had one so i ordered it. That was when i found out orzly had all sorts of cases for electronics. So i went back to amazon and checked out the orzly store. Just the case instore is usually 40 but this bundle was only 23. I ordered it wednesday it arrived saturday. I closely inspected it and found it to be very good quality and very well made. The tempered glass screen protectors are much appreciated and dont affect the screen sensitivity.

    I like everything about this except the 'net' inside.  When you hold the 'handle', the basket is upside down inside and and doesn't close so everything in it falls out.  I love the durable casing that fits around the switch and the case itself holds the switch steady, otherwise.  I'm happy to have it but I wish that the net inside had a zipper, which I've seen other cases have.  I received all the parts advertised and everything was great, the stylus, the game case, the power cord.

    Came as advertised the earphones and pen are of cheap quality but i didnt buy this for that anyways i bought it for the case which is great holds my switch and all the stuff ill need in hand held mode, the silicone grips are very nice my only problem is taking them off they feel very stiff and it feels like im gonna break my switch in half trying to remove it, you'll have to remove it if you want to dock your switch. The screen protectors were good and easy to install Looks very sleek, finally the extra charging cable is very nice and convenient overall im very satisfied with my purchase would recommend to any switch owner..
