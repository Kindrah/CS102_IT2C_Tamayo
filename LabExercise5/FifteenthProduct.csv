    Like the item's quality, it’s sleek not bulky at all. The handle is not flimsy. I like the screen protector flap inside and how it can hold eight games on the other side of the flap. It fits my Nintendo Switch OLED perfectly!

    This is an excellent case for your new Nintendo Switch. I ordered it the day it was put on Amazon for an amazingly low price, so I did not have high expectations, but I am happily surprised at the high quality of this case.  The case is hard enough to fully protect your Nintendo Switch, yet flexible enough to fit in bags and carry everywhere with you.  The case has nice little rubber handle and zips shut. There is no zipper on the inside of the case.Inside you will find it is lined with a soft microfiber. There is a mesh pocket on the top that goes about 3/4 of the way up and holds a ton of stuff. The bottom of the case has a double sided flap. The top holds 8 cartridges and the bottom is padded to fully protect your Nintendo switch screen. The bottom of the case is form molded to hold your Nintendo Switch perfectly and even has loose fitting elastic on each side to help secure it in place. I originally bought the officially licensed Tough Pouch, but much prefer this one. They are almost identical in size and appear to be made about the same way. The pouch is a fraction thinner and does not have a handle. It has almost the same inside except not as useful. The flap that protects the screen is sewn at the top and does not fully protect the screen on the touch pouch, where this one is on the bottom and fully protects the screen. The Orzly case holds 8 games and accessories and the tough pouch only holds the switch and 5 cartridges.  Another thing I love about this case is that it is simple and black. There is no advertising on it anywhere and no way for thieves to know you are carrying an brand new Video Game Console.Please see photos for more details and please excuse the crappy screen protector I have on the Switch in these pics. The 5th picture shows the Orzly pouch on top and the Tough Pouch on the bottom for size comparison.Highlights:* Holds 8 cartridges or micro SD cards* Large Mesh Pouch can hold all cords, chargers, or an accessory. I even fit 2 entire game cases in the pouch!* Large soft screen protector sewn into case.* Handle for carrying the case.* Lightweight, yet strong and durable.* The Soft, microfiber interior protects your console and controllers from everyday wear and tear, bumps and scrapes.This case is well worth the $25 it retails for and the case I compared it to is currently selling for $40! Only issue I had was that it was sent in a bubble mailer, so the outside box was crushed. This would be a problem if it were a gift, but it did not affect the actual product in any way.

    After spending big bucks on my Granddaughters Nintendo Switch I realized “Holy Cow” I bought nothing to protect it!! She is only 8 and walks around with it and uses it in the car. When I drop my cell phone  I am always glad I have a case! I immediately ordered this one and it’s perfect, a safe place for everything and a sturdy handle for on the go!  Not expensive and she always uses it!

    Overall the product is great. However, one of the complaints I have is that whenever you try to put in the Joy Con Grip in the case, the cause becomes extremely bulky, and it causes me to worry that if ever drop the case that it might crack my switch's screen. Also, obviously you can't put an elite controller in the case which sucks because you either need a separate bag or you have to carry it in your hand. Otherwise the case is EXTREMELY good, the bands that hold the switch is great, the pockets that hold small accessories are amazing (it can hold the charger and extra joy cons), and the zipper & sturdiness of the case is phenomenal. Therefore, I would highly recommend getting this case even if it is on the pricier side.

    When I'm spending the weekend out of town, I use a nice, big carrying case the can hold the whole system set up. That's great for a whole weekend, but when I'm going to be stuck someplace boring for an evening or just a few hours, now I can take what I need to stave off boredom without having to carry everything I own. This case is sturdy enough that I don't have to worry about breaking anything and roomy enough to hold extra controllers, cords, games, or anything else I can't live without. And it still fits in my purse. Great product!

    I use this case for 90% of the instances where I leave the house and take my switch. I don't take it with me on a daily basis but some weeks I'll take it to work at the office for all 5 days. I've also taken it on vacation for a week in Las Vegas.It's rigid enough to protect the items inside but it's got a smooth exterior with no sharp edges so it's not a danger to anything around it. The zipper quality seems fine and I don't have any worries about breakage there. The carrying strap is a nice length such that it's actually practical. For anyone that's concerned about it fitting in the pockets of your pants, it likely won't.The interior has enough space for the console, some game carts and a couple cables (but not the power brick). The lining and materials of the interior are soft and won't scratch the Switch screen. The straps to secure the Switch inside are a nice touch and appear to be durable. There's a good amount of give to the straps but enough tension to safely secure without putting excess pressure on the Switch. I haven't attempted to put a backup set of joy-cons inside so I can't comment on whether the pictures in the product description are accurate or not in regards to that.It's good enough that I'm not shopping for an alternative case in this size.

    This carrier for the Nintendo Switch is really nice. It holds everything it needs and honestly, the quality is great. For as many times as this thing gets opened, the zipper appears to be holding strong. I'm happy with this purchase.

    If you want a decent hard case for your Switch, look no further. The way it's seperated out is convenient and easy to navigate when transporting mulitple games or controllers. It's also slim enough to fit into my backback when traveling which is a huge bonus.

    Se siente muy resistente por fuera, y es fácil de transportar, casi no ocupa espacio. El único inconveniente es que si traes muy pocas cosas en la malla, probablemente se salgan y hay que abrir con cuidado, pero la switch esta bien protegida y todo se siente de buena calidad.

    Overall, this is a very serviceable case and is capable of carrying everything I would expect for a portable experience with the Nintendo Switch.  The case has a solid-feeling hard rubber black shell with two zippers a molded section for the Switch and attached joycons and an accessories pocket.  The case also has a handy carrying handle on the spine of the shell with a molded rubber grip.The Switch console section of the case also has two elastic bands to hold the console in place when the case is opened.  There's a middle section of the case that covers just the screen area to protect it from damage from anything you might put in the other pocket, and that section doubles as game card storage with small slots for game cards.  However, there is no storage for any extra microSD cards you may carry.  This isn't a huge deal breaker, as you could theoretically put one in a game card slot (the mesh on the slots is fine enough that a microSD card won't fall through).The accessories pocket that sits opposite the console has a mesh and elastic netting which holds the accessories in place.  However, since this mesh covers only about 2/3rds of the pocket area, I have found that how you place your accessories in this pocket will determine whether everything stays in place when you open the case or whether you have to go fishing for things that fall out.  On a plane especially, this is critically important.  That said, I'm able to comfortably fit two extra joycons (with side covers), the side covers for the joycons currently attached to the Switch console and the power adapter provided by Nintendo in the accessories pocket.On the subject of opening the case- since there are no distinctive markings on the outside rubber shell of the case and the case exterior appears symmetrical, it's easy to open the case upside down and accidentally drop accessories out.  My personal solution to this is to always zip the zipper from right to left when closing (since there are two, you can theoretically go any direction you like).  Since I have adopted that as a convention, I always know the case is right-side-up if the handle is in the back, the zipper is closed and the zipper heads are on the left side of the case.  This is a minor annoyance at first; but, once you get familiar with the case design, I imagine everyone will instinctively know the direction the typically zip it on closing.In addition, while it wasn't difficult at all to close the case and zip it with all my accessories inside, I did notice the seam showing when the case was closed.  This seems to be okay and upon initial testing doesn't seem to portend weakness in the construction of the case; but, only time will tell.  I'm a lighter user of the portable mode of the Switch; but, if I find that the seam starts pulling apart later, I'll come back to update my review and let Orzly know of the potential defect.Finally, one other thing to note is that the case smells VERY strongly of plastic when first opened.  Even as an electronics enthusiast who likes the smell of new electronics (hooray for Pavlovian training), the smell is a little overpowering at first.  I left the case open the first day I owned it, since I wasn't travelling and didn't yet need to use it and the smell has mostly dissipated.Pros:- Comfortably fits everything necessary for table-top portable mode play- Console protected from accessories by screen shield- Game storage in screen shield- Molded console pocket and elastic straps hold console firmly in place- Tough feeling shell, seems durable- Comfortable handle for convenient carryingCons:- Accessories pocket not covered enough by mesh to prevent accessories from falling out without being careful about how they are inserted- Symmetric exterior design makes it easy to open the case upside down, making dumping the accessories more of a risk- No storage dedicated to microSD cards (though the game card slots could double as a microSD card slots)- Strong plastic smell for a few hours upon initial opening- Flat black exterior design is functional but not as attractive as some other casesVerdict- all in all, I'm pleased.  The case is inexpensive and so far seems up to the task of holding everything you need to enjoy gaming on the go.  The simple flat black design leaves something to be desired aesthetically; but, the functional interior of the case makes up for this flaw, especially considering the good price.

This case is great. It’s hard on the outside. Holds games and the switch itself also room for extra controls the switch is secure with straps if it’s dropped I feel confident that it’s not breaking in there.

    I can't compare this case to any others, since this is the only one I've bought for the Switch, but I can say that I'm thoroughly satisfied with this one.Pros:+ No visible markings as to what's inside. Honestly, it looks like I could be carrying a multimeter, or microphone or anything else in there;+ No giant company logo. Actually, upon looking at it, there's no logo at all, anywhere;+ Big pocket up top. I put in a portable generic charger, extra charge cable, cleaning cloth, and the wrist strap things for if you hold the joycons detached. I could fit more but I was more concerned with just keeping the majority of the accessories in one place,+ Hard shell. It's rigid and seems to be water resistant.+ Screen protector/game storage. Great use of space;+ Recessed areas around the joycons so that the triggers aren't putting pressure on the sliding connectors.+ Carry strap. Nice to have, but I can't comment on how long it'll hold up.Cons:- Some kind of ""this side up"" indicator. Maybe some stand-off moulding on the bottom so it sits squarely on a level surface;- Elastic straps are a good idea for the clumsy/inattentive, but will wear out with use and are a pain to get the switch in and out of. Plus I got the joysticks stuck on one taking it out and the rubber on the stick got caught under the ball for a bit. I would have preferred velcro straps.In-between:~ Case is maybe too simple. A small logo in the corner of the top side would help identify the product manufacturer for future purchases as well as tell you which side is up so that you don't need to rely on the elastic bands to keep it from falling out;~ There's a smaller recessed area on the bottom of the case, not sure what it's for quite yet. It doesn't fit the wrist straps, and the vents aren't in that area;~ Not as hard-shell as I would've liked. It's got a bit of squish near the zipper, which means there's a bit of play. Great if you're the type to pack it to the limit, but maybe a little more caution needed when tossing into a backpack. Regardless, under regular conditions it should keep the joysticks from getting stuck in a bent position.EDIT: spelling and grammatical errors

    This case is as advertised - it holds the system with controllers, has a sleeve for physical game cartridges, and has a pouch for some accessories. However, I don't feel that it's a good fit if you will need to charge the system while you're out or traveling. If you are taking this in the car on the way to grandma's house, then it should be just fine. But if you are going to be on a long flight or in the car for several hours and would need to charge it, I wouldn't recommend this case. If I have the charging cable in there, it sticks out to the point where I'd be concerned it would crack the system screen or one of the game cartridges, as well as altering the outside of the case when I close and zip it.Great case for short trips, not so much for traveling or if you need to charge it.
