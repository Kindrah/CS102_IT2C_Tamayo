    There are a lot of different gaming mice out there but a lot of gaming mice on the market in my opinion kind of just over do it. They are just way to expensive or have to many unneeded features (like 12+ buttons, covered in rainbow RGB lighting, wireless or have a super weird shape/feel)I just need a simple gaming mouse…I was at tech-school for my training in the Air force (I know, weirdest place out of anywhere) and I had my gaming laptop mailed to me so on my days off, I could play games with my sister & friends. For a long time I used a basic Dell computer-lab work mouse, and it gets the job done but I thought maybe it was time for a fun upgrade. There was a GameStop at a mall and there I bought a white colored Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse. I'm going to tell you now… I immediately LOVED it! Perfect balance of a gaming mouse with some cool features but not overdoing it. Exactly as it says in the name… it's the basic essentials for a gaming mouse! And for the price of $30? Not bad at all.The size, shape and feel is really good. not overdoing it in my opinion, giving a great ergonomic feeling when in use. The two extra side buttons are great and not overbearing (like with some mice and their 6+ extra buttons all over the mouse) two, in my opinion, are just enough. Lastly the fact that it's wired is nice, helps with price & simplicity. It has some RGB lighting but not all over the place or crazy so no complaints for that.I rebought one but in the color black so it better matches my laptop and gave my sister the white colored one. Had the white one for almost a year and had ZERO issues or problems with it. If you want a simple, nice and cool gaming mouse that is just the ESSENTIALS this is for you!!!!

    I LOVE this mouse. I got it after getting back into PC gaming after a hiatus.PROS:-Feels great in-hand.-Cable is plenty long.-It's not heavy, but it has a decent weight to it.-Build quality is solid.CONS:-The only bad thing I have to say about this mouse is after a couple months of daily use, the scroll wheel sensors don't function properly. After doing some research, it looks like dust builds up on the sensor, making the wheel ""bounce"" when scrolling.SIMPLE FIX: Blow into the space between the mouse and the scroll wheel. If you have pressurized air that will work much better. It's only a temporary fix, and can get annoying, but it does fix the issue!Other than that one issue, this mouse is incredible for the price. Likely will upgrade to something a little more ""pro"" in the future, but for the last few months this has held up great, and I'll likely use it for another 6+ months before upgrading.

    I disagree that this mouse is considered a gaming mouse.  Other than the fancy logo and color changing LEDs, there is not much about this mouse that caters it for gaming.  I use gaming mice and prefer ones with more than just two side buttons, and a much heavier weight.  This is a lightweight mouse which is fine for office work where you're in front of a computer 8 hours a day, but I would much prefer something different for gaming.But as a general use office mouse, it works great.  It is ergonomic enough to be used right or left handed, the scroll wheel works fine, and the buttons press with a reassuring CLICK.  For the price, use this in your office, but if you want to get into a Call of Duty or Fortnight tournament, definitely get something else.

    Edt October 12th, 2023 -On the 9th, the right click started acting funky. I restarted my PC and unplugged and replugged it in, and it fixed. However, I believe this was coincidental. On the 10th, the right click started acting HORRENDOUS. As in, triple clicking, clicking when not pressing, dropping clicks entirely... Restarting and replugging it did not change a thing. Tested on another PC, same issue. Swapped out cable extenders, same issue. Attempted plugging it directly into the PC, as inconvenient as that would be in my setup... still the issue. Multiple ports, no help.I firmly believe stuff happens. Quality control is not, and never will be perfect. I ended up reordering this mouse off Wal-Mart to see. So far it is working flawless. The mouse is incredible, I think I got unlucky here... again. I also ordered an EVGA X20 off Amazon. Hope it goes better, too. I still think overall I would recommend this product, as it wouldn't have such a high rating so consistently if this happened incredibly often. I will dock a few starts, but I honestly still think the mouse it good.X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-XOriginal post -I first ordered a Redragon M910K, and it was faulty. I decided to put 10 extra dollars in and order this mouse instead.  Take note this is a day one review and if I have problems, I will update. Assume this is all still relevant if you see this review after a couple months and I haven't edited it.  First Impressions  -Glide is good. Feels very smooth.  -Cable pulls the mouse slightly due to the smooth glide. However, not much, and if your cable is tied forward, or simply going straight, you won't notice it. Just don't have your cable go off at an angle immediately and you need not to worry.  -Feels very... non-durable? I wouldn't slam it. If you aren't a heavy rager, it should be fine. Hit your keyboard instead. NOT CHEAP FEELING THOUGH. Feels perfectly fine for this price!  -Simple look. Black with Green LED's. Perfect printing on the logo.  -Side buttons are a bit high for me, if your thumb rests low like mine, you may have a hard time reaching them. That's why the ""Ergonomic"" is a 4 star, but only from a personal stance not an overall stance.  -Very Comfortable. Enough said  Overall, I am very happy with this, and if this review is un-updated, I still am. Just waiting for the software to install to change my DPI currently. If you are looking for a good mouse below $30, this is a good mouse. A very good mouse.  Would I recommend it at this price range? Yes.  Best regards from a fat idiot

    I was just about to buy another mouse when I decided to check the reviews for this and found out about the scrollwheel dust problem.  Sure enough, after blowing air into the scrollwheel to remove the dust from the sensor as another reviewer mentioned, the broken scrolling fixed itself.  Saved me a lot of money and frustration.  Problems began about 6 or 7 months after purchasing.  By the 8th month, scrolling was so bad that entire web articles would jump back to the top if I accidently tried to scroll down a bit.  It was making the mouse unusable.I like the ergonomics well enough, except I can't get used to the rear thumb button for gaming.  If you use your last 2 digits a lot when pointing and tend to rotate the mouse inwards like I do, the rear thumb button can end up a bit out of reach for quick responses.  Overall it is actually more comfortable than the mouse this replaced.  However, I strongly dislike the software package.  The way it runs in the background and seems to pop up randomly just gives strong bloatware vibes.I'm used to being able to change DPI on-the-fly with a button (feature of my old mouse), and I just can't seem to get used to software's DPI settings for it--it never seems right.  If one game ends up needing a different DPI setting than another, there's no other way than to boot the software up to change it.  For someone who doesn't like using in-game settings changes, this is annoying.  I'd much rather be able to stay in game, change with a button click, test, and then repeat until I get what I want.  I dislike going into menus between every DPI test, it just doesn't feel intuitive (it makes me wonder why games don't have a DPI testing mode so that I can changes more real-time).I really wish it had 2 more buttons than it has, but I knew that was going to bother me going into this purchase.The lighting is wildly annoying until you change it in the settings.  I have no idea why anyone would set ""high-speed rainbow"" to be the default lighting.  I had to unplug it to sleep the first night.With my old Corsair mouse, I could use the software to tweak the mouse, and then store profiles inside the mouse.  I could then transfer the mouse to another computer or uninstall the software and nothing would be affected.  I'm sure I'll go back to Corsair whenever this mouse dies.  There's just nothing other than overall shape where this mouse wins out over my old (sadly retired model) mouse.

    We had a Razer mouse for quite a while and all the kids used it for gaming, but over time the left mouse button started having issues.  If I wanted to click and drag a file or something from one part of my screen to another, it would often drop the item I was dragging.Finally bought a new one and that issue is gone.  New mouse is great.  Have noticed a few times that it seems to double click on the left mouse button when I didn't intend for a left click.  Hopefully that doesn't become a bigger issue.  But for the price, it's the most affordable, and still reliable, gaming mouse you can buy.

    I had used an old Death Adder Elite at work that began having issues with the scroll wheel.  I didn't want to spend $80+ on a new one, so when I saw the price tag on this one I was immediately curious.  The shape seems to be identical to the one I had (the reason I wanted another one), but the only complaint I have is that the Elite I had had a rubberized pad on either side that made it a bit ""sticky"" to your fingers so you could pick it up and reposition it easier on the mouse pad.  This mouse does not have have those rubberized pads, so I have had it slip out of my hand when trying to grip it to reposition.  So far, though, that is the only complaint I have with the mouse.  Clearly a cost-saving measure to keep the price down, but something I didn't expect and immediately noticed.

    I was using a Cyberpower gaming mouse for a few years. But recently the scroll wheel started misbehaving so I figured I'd replace it. It's not bad. I don't do much gaming these days so I just wanted a comfortable cheap mouse to replace what I had, and wanted some similar features like the side buttons that make using the internet easier. I wish it was a bit heavier but for price - sure why not? Is it the best? No. Is it better than a wally world generic? Yes. So basically, budget friendly and good for non-gaming duties.

    This mouse is a simple mouse, and it does the job! It DPI is a lot higher than my old mouse which was a the steelseries 850.Simple mouses will last the longest, complex mouses are better but if your a casual gamer, web browser, work then this simple gaming mouse will be more than enough quality for you and barely hit your piggy bank!

    I just got the Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse, and I really like it for my gaming setup.First off, it feels good in my hand. The design is simple but comfy, and the textured grips on the sides keep it from slipping during long gaming sessions.

What's cool is that it doesn't cost a lot, making it perfect for gamers who want quality without spending too much.Sure, it doesn't have all the fancy lights like some other mice, but for the price and how well it works, I'm okay with that.

    Great price. I've had 2 different versions of this mouse and they were both great. The white one would pick up dirt and eventually died on me after like 4 years so I bought the black one and the color is perfect. Doesnt show any dirt and works like a charm.

    This mouse is on the large side, which I personally like.  It's movement is very smooth and responsive, and the top buttons and mouse wheel all feel great and work well.  For me, the issue is the buttons on the left side, which are used for forward/back in a web browser.  The buttons are so large that I frequently bump them when I reach for the mouse, disturbing whatever I'm doing.  I know I can disable them by using the included software, but I am not currently running that software, and I don't want to have yet another service/application running simply to disable two mouse buttons that are in the way.

    This mouse is like playing on the Xbox controller versus the PlayStation 3 controller.Absolutely needed for any adult who's tired of cramping their hand trying to use a toy to control their computer. I've been using a DeathAdder since version 1 and it makes me bitter whenever I'm forced to use another mouse on a different computer simply from the ergonomics alone.

    I like the ergonomics of this mouse, and its sturdiness as well. Still, the USB output seems to fail sometimes (sometimes I have to disconnect it and then plug it in again so it works), and the Razer software is a bit bloated. I do not regret the purchase tho. Ergonomics wise, t's been a nice upgrade from my Logitech G201, still, I believe that the former has a greater value overall, since it is cheaper and since Logitech's software seems to run better.

    At first I had to get used to the size as I had just come from a small silent Logitech mouse. The click is so loud! On everything. Thing is light, hollow feeling (ok the loss of material is good for gamers because a light mouse is easy to control, but c'mon, feels cheap.) The side buttons feel like they'd wear out fast and I don't really use them, but because of that I truly can't speak of their quality. But the primary clickers (left and right mouse) have held up well. The green accents light up and its really attractive. Seems pretty snappy and responsive. Good mouse.

    The mouse is amazing. The mouse actually have 6400 dpi. The mouse has its own software to customize the dpi and all. The mouse is a little too big for 11-13 year olds but if they don't care amazing mouse for gaming.

    My mouse broke after years of hard use. In a pinch I borrowed this mouse from my daughter who uses it for gaming. In one sitting, I fell in love with a mouse in a way I didn't know was possible. It's quick, smooth, and fits beautifully in the hand. I immediately ordered my own. I wanted a corded version, but I think you can get it Bluetooth if you prefer. So happy.

    The mouse was too big for my hands, so I recommend a G305 from Logitech if you have smaller hands, but it's a good mouse.

    Best mouse for its price, hands down. No mouse for this cheap compared to this beast of Razer products. No problems included with this mouse... except maybe the biohazard awaiting in its box. With the confident opinion of almost TWO YEARS strong, it gets just a little dirty at times. Maybe its just me and my disgusting self, which I wouldn't be surprised, or the product itself, but it feels just like a failed science project was slapped on it at times. Absolutely no issues except the need to deep clean it every so often, but This is the one product out of a few that I would personally recommend to others.

    Got as a gift for my sister but when I set it up for her I was a bit jealous and went and got myself one. That was her birthday almost two years ago, they're both still in regular use.

    My kid has a version of this mouse that has had zero issues in the 2 years they've owned it but this one here has been giving my wife issues with the scroll wheel after only 6 months. I disassembled the mouse and removed some small hairs and strands of plastic that were attached to the wheel itself. I don't believe these were causing the issue so I hit the wheel and encoder with compressed air and reassembled. The mouse no long has the wheel jitter but the  scrolling feels slow to me. I don't use that mouse often so my frame of reference isn't the best. I still prefer my Logitech G602 over this mouse.

    I love the mouse but you cannot change the color because it isn’t compatible with chrom studio in razor synapse it’s also a little heavy but personally i like it

    I bought this mouse when it was priced at $29.99, thinking it would be a good addition to my collection of gaming mice. However, for $29.99, you get a mouse that clearly has some design flaws.Within the first few days of usage, I noticed a number of instances in which the left mouse button was triggering more inputs off of a single click than intendedAlso, the material of the mouse versus more high end Razer products felt like this one was made out of plastic and rubber rather than aluminum or other kinds of metal and fabrics that are designed to be more flexible, responsive and comfortable.I wasn't necessarily disappointed with this mouse, but if you're looking for a cheap mouse that's branded for gaming and doesn't cut corners on quality, I recommend avoiding this one.

    Survived one year of moderate gaming. This is a very solid 4 STAR mouse. A year of use for $25 dollars is a good deal in my opinion. Nothing fancy, just a solid four-button mouse that will last you a year, more or less based on use intensity.
