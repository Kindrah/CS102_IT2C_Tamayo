    So I've always had a pop socket on any phone case I've had for the grip. What I dislike about them is that the design always wears off after time, and once stuck to a case, they're impossible to ever remove. I got a new phone and had to purchase a new phone case. The case I bought said it was 'MagSafe compatible', so when it came to purchasing a pop socket for the new case, I got this one. I've never used the magnetic line before. I LOVE that I can remove my pop socket now at any time, and that I can actually use a car mount as well! My old pop sockets made it so I never could. I will definitely always be purchasing the magnetic pop sockets in the future- though I don't think I'll need to ever re-purchase because I can simply remove this one and put it on a different case!

    Popsockets are great with certain phones. I have a zfold 5 and it makes it so easy to hold when the phone is unfolded using the big screen. My only advice is get it from the real Popsockets store here in Amazon. Not a reseller or knockoff. It says on corner of screen ""shipped or sold by popsocket"". The fake ones don't stick.

    The PopSockets Phone Grip with Expanding Kickstand in Neon Pink is an absolute game-changer! Not only does it work great as a phone grip, providing a secure and comfortable hold, but the expanding kickstand is also incredibly convenient for hands-free viewing.I love the vibrant neon pink color, which adds a fun and stylish pop to my phone. It's a great way to personalize and accessorize my device while also adding functionality.The adhesive backing is strong and secure, ensuring that the PopSocket stays firmly in place on my phone. Plus, the collapsible design makes it easy to adjust and fold flat when not in use, so it doesn't add bulk to my phone when I'm not using it.Overall, I'm extremely impressed with the PopSockets Phone Grip with Expanding Kickstand. It works great, looks fantastic, and adds both style and functionality to my phone. Highly recommend!

    Itâ€™s been a few months with this popsocket and I love it. super durable and works as a kick stand. I got it to match my case and it makes it easier to hold my phone when I use it!

    This is a different version that the one I used to own. The pop out part is on the cap (push down and twist like medical pill bottle to release) and not at the base (pop out 4 holding grooves to release). This version technically has wireless charging compatible (more on this later). If you have a lot of the older version popsocket, know that the caps donâ€™t work on the new version.Been using popsockets for at least half a decade now. Very functional with some minor inconveniences that I must work around, but overall worked well for me.What I love about is it that it provides better grip when holding the phone. Now if I use a phone without it in public, feels like anyone can snatch my phone off my hand at any second, or Iâ€™m afraid I may  accidently slip off my hand and drop the floorCan get better reach with fingers while still providing grip on the phone if you carry a larger phone.Also great as tabletop/kicks stand when I need it. Tend to use it all the time when watching steaming videos while eating or on casual video calls. No need to bring additional stand accessoryThere are some official accessories for it that I use, but also made some DIY ones. For example, if you have magnet attachment phone mount, you can disassemble the popsocket and put the metal plate inside with tape, and make it attach to magnetic surfaces (This only works with older version and not this one)This version can wirelessly charge if you attach it on your phone directly with no case. But the charging speed is not as fast than without popsocketAdhesive works well on all phones case surfaces I currently own. Heard from a co-worker that it didnâ€™t work for them when they used it on items with waterproof surfacesIf you have accessories that holds the popsocket in place; I wouldnâ€™t use the popsocket on them for at least 24 hours so it doesnâ€™t peel itself off due to gravity during initial adhesion period.Extremely strong. Unless you intentionally use excessive force, it wonâ€™t fall off. Peeling the popsocket off can leave stains depending how long you had it on. With some cleaning tools can scrap it off without leaving much residue. Use hand sanitzer to take off the residue, better than using soup or just water.To take it off once itâ€™s stuck on you must use fingernails (will not work if you have long nails) or a thin flat head screw driver around the circumferenceThey are durable. Aside from paint wearing off overtime, the first one I own still works like it did day 1. Iâ€™m not rough with my popsocket or phones so may want to take that under consideration (?)-Cons of the popsocket can be worked around.It adds thickness. As thick or slightly thicker than your phone without a case, making it 2x thicker at one location. If you wear tight pants/jeans, there will get a budge, especially if you put it in your back pocket.Seeing the bulge is not uniform can wobble when typing on phone on a flat surface.If you stick the popsocket on the phone directly, may interfere with some of its functionality such as wireless charging (if you have the older version). Thatâ€™s why I always opt to put it on a case.Never happened to me, but my co-worker said it get snatched onto things when trying to pull it out of her purse. Maybe she has way too many stuff in there, or the fact that I always carry my phone in my pocket or dedicated pocket in my backpack.Overall, despite the negatives I find it very useful for daily tasks.

    Iâ€™m a big fan of popsockets. But when I switched to a MagSafe case, I couldnâ€™t use my old ones anymore. Then I found this product! A few bad reviews, but I think those ppl had the wrong case or something because this thing is AMAZING!! Strong hold. Sturdy. Exactly what Iâ€™d expect from this brand. I have an iPhone 15 max pro and itâ€™s able to be picked up by just the popsocket and holds like a champ! Donâ€™t believe the bad reviews. This thing is perfect. I have a Kate spade MagSafe and works like a dream.

    Good quality and cute, sticks right onto any case with magsafe very strong magnet it will not fall off. Popsocket itself is smaller than the average one so it take a minute to adjust to at first but over all really good.

    The ring stuck nicely to my case. My case is not perfectly smooth but it doesn't seem to matter. The magnet seems strong. I'm happy. I have a stand type wireless charger so I need to take the popsocket off to charge phone. The metal ring stays on the case and doesn't interfere with the charging. But you do have to take the popspocket off to charge the phone.  It's nice to hold onto the popsocket and talk when I go for a long walk.  I don't think you need the metal ring to be magnetic. You just need it to be made of the right type of metal - which it is.

    For $10 I thought (a) the adhesion would come undone, or (b) the device would break. I pop it in/out many times a day, used on my Kindle while laying on my back. Ie, the full Kindle downward gravity against the pop socket. And I read many hours a day, so this has really stood the test. I fiddle with it sometimes, popping it in and out, rotating it, and it's never ""joint health"" so to speak. I'm pretty surprised.Ok, this being my first PopSocket, I don't know if they vary in terms of depth (how long it pops out) - but as a large man, it's pretty uncomfortable to sandwich between two fingers. It splays my fingers really wide, and I think it could be bad on the knuckles over time. I've switched to holding it skip-finger: ring and index, with middle resting on the top. That's the most comfortable, but I just feel if they gave it a tad more depth it wouldn't be necessary. Either way, I think mixing it up a bunch is your best bet besides, so you'll find something that works for you.

    I got this popsocket so have one I can remove when I stick my magsafe portable charger to the back of my phone and it works just fine for that.The only thing is when popping the socket into the extended position the sudden snap from pulling on it to open it sometimes makes it detach from my phone. Now once it is open and on my hand it stays on well I can hold it upsidedown and it stays. Now that I am aware of the issue i simply hold the base part of the popsocket when extending it so it doesnt come off so it doesnt really bother me but I can see it being frustrating for people because pulling out our phones is a reflex and I can see people in a rush potentially dropping their phone because of this so I am deducting one star for that on what is otherwise a product that does what I expected and wanted.Overall happy with the purchase.

    I was really sad when I upgraded my phone and bought a speck magnetic case. Realized after they charged me like $50 for the case(shouldnâ€™t have gotten it thru the cell phone company. Lesson learned) that I couldnâ€™t use my beloved pop socket and still use my magnet car mount. The socket kept the magnets from barely touchingThen I saw this and now I have the best of both worlds. Iâ€™ve only dropped my phone on my face about 5000 times since not having the pop socket. So Iâ€™m very glad to have it back and still be able to use my expensive case(ðŸ™„) and car mount!The magnet is strong but still easy to get off when you want it off. Very sturdy. Definitely recommend!

    this popsocket being magsafe is super clutch.  i use it with a torras magsafe case, and the magnet strength between the two is amazing. it takes considerable intentional effort to remove the popsocket from the case, so i know it'll never accidentally slip off. i previously had (and lost) the older pill version of this, and i'm not sure why, but this one feels more comfortable. i was able to grab this item while it was on sale for $20 which i think is totally worth it.

    I loved my old popsocket and with my new iPhone 15 I needed something new.  I decided to do magsafe and bought this cute Harry Potter grip.  LOVE.  It sticks to the back of the phone so well.  I have never had an issue.  I do have to take it off for the car mount because the popsocket brand does not work with iPhone 15, but that's okay because the grip pops on and off SO EASILY!  I do like my grip lower because of the way I hold my phone, but this has worked out and I'm getting used to it.  Would definitely recommend and buy again.

    Upgraded my iPhone & tried a MagSafe ring but didnâ€™t like it. Stumbled across this MagSafe pop socket & I was so excited. I love a pop socket for pictures and to use as a phone stand. The magnet is a strong. Iâ€™ve been using it for several months and itâ€™s never once fell off! I got the clear to match my clear glitter case & it does have a thin white circle where the magnet is. Over time the flat surface has scratched but hardly noticeable unless the light itâ€™s it. Highly recommend if you love a pop socket like me!

    This is a game changer! I am just now finding out that they make magnetic pop sockets!! I hated always having to take the case off to set it on my wireless charger on my bedside table at night to charge. Using the cord for charging, fine, but anytime to use a wireless the pop sockets that were adhered in place, were simply inconvenient. Also with car phone holders, Iâ€™d have to purchase one with a hole for the pop socket to fit in. Now I can just remove it, set it, and reattach when Iâ€™m ready! I canâ€™t believe I havenâ€™t already known this! Strongly recommend.Note- it stays in place well, strong hold for gentle to normal use! Now if youâ€™re rough with your phone, or drop it, it will pop off if itâ€™s a rough/strong hit. Otherwise, itâ€™s fantastic!

    Nice but donâ€™t like size Iâ€™m used to the regular popsocket if your a fan of those then u will feel the difference of grip/size between your fingers when u are holding it I kinda get cramped hands holding it I donâ€™t think I will keep using it it is really nice color and style just the sizing for my small fingers arenâ€™t too great better for people maybe with larger hands also the magnet works great n itâ€™s nice it came with a sticker magnet which I didnâ€™t know I could have just put on my old case instead of buying a new case

    So so so HAPPY they finally came out with a MagSafe PopSocket! I always have a magsafe case on for my car phone holder and for wireless charging and was always sad I couldn't have a PopSocket on. I can finally use it again with an easy pop on and pop off when necessary! Love it!

    This is my first MagSafe Popsocket and I love it! Way nicer than the sticky adhesive ones, which Iâ€™ve been using for years though because I do love all Popsocket products. The magnetic one just feels like a really sleek upgrade. I have an older iPhone 11 and am using a special MagSafe compatible case on it. So I did not need to use the magnetic adapter ring that Popsocket offered in the package. Love love love the lavender color against my clear case and white phone! Will definitely continue to order Popsocket products in the future.

    The magnets that hold it to my phone case are very strong. Though the placement doesnâ€™t feel the most comfortable, thatâ€™s not the popsocketâ€™s fault - thatâ€™s just where the MagSafe magnets are in the case. The color is why I took one star off, itâ€™s not quite the blue as represented in the picture. Itâ€™s pretty, but much lighter and closer to turquoise than I was expecting.

    At first, I couldnâ€™t understand what the rave was about.  So I decided to buy one and I also bought a magnetic base and mounted it to the base for my MagSafe phone.  This way I could pop it off and put it on anytime I wanted and it did not interfere with placing my phone on the charger.  I have to say I really love it, and regret not purchasing one sooner.

    I wasn't sure if I would be happy with a magnetic pop socket. I have been a pop socket user for many years (need it for selfies) but had always used the sticky ones. This magnetic one is excellent! The magnet is very strong and sturdy and yet, when I need to remove it, I can. Very happy with this high quality purchase!

    Edit: I reached out to popsocket directly and they got back to me quickly with a code to use for a replacement. I love the metal but I will probably get an all plastic one because I have concerns about the metals longevity. Updating number of stars to 4 for the service and the overall functionality of the item.I love this and love the metal it makes it look a lot more elevated but the gold is tarnishing within a month of use. :( I guess I am going to return and get another version because I love the MagSafe tech and being able to take it on and off.

    I've used pop sockets for a few years now. Mine would have lasted longer, except I made the mistake of wearing my phone on a lanyard & caught it on a drawer handle when leaning over at work. Since I have a vinyl phone case, I have used super glue to make sure the socket is securely in place. Other than that, it sticks well with the adhesive already on it.

    So far I have kind of a love/hate relationship with this Popsocket. I've been using regular adhesive Popsockets for many years, so when I finally got a MagSafe compatible case for my phone I was so excited to try the MagSafe Popsocket. So I'll start with the good things:1) Obviously, having the option to remove the Popsocket completely is top tier. I was able to wireless charge before (not with MagSafe) with the adhesive base on my old case, but removing the Pop grip entirely helps my phone connect easier. Also, it's just nice to have the option to take it off if I don't want it there for whatever reason, and I don't have to worry about adhesive ruining my case.2) Magnets are nice and strong so I'm not worried about it falling off. In fact, I struggle a bit to get it off sometimes.3) I got the warm lavender and the color is very pretty. I believe the top is swappable too, although I have a hard time twisting it off, I think because of the thick edges around it.Which brings me to the things I don't totally love...1) How big it is. I know this round design is a huge improvement from the ""pill"" shaped MagSafe grip (which I would never have bought lol), and I know it has to be a certain size to work with MagSafe anyway. I guess I'm just not used to it taking up so much space on the back of my case. For reference, I have the regular iPhone 12, so maybe you have one of those huge pop-tart phones it won't look so large.2) The border around the actual grip where the magnets are. Don't get me wrong, it's slim and fits against the phone nicely, but it feels weird to hold because there's less space for my fingers between the grip and the back of the phone now. Maybe I'm just too sensitive, idk.3) This is probably me being weird again but for some reason when my grip is closed down, whatever type of plastic it's made of makes a strange sticky/squeaky sound. I think because it's a different type of plastic than grips I've used before, since it's translucent. Now, some people might not notice this, or some people might even like it. As I said, I'm just a little weird, but the sound bothers me regardless and makes it seem kinda cheap. Which for a $30 phone grip.... yeah, not McLovin' it.So, long story short, I have no idea if I'm going to keep this. I guess I'll try it for another week or so and see how I feel about it. Not gonna lie, the few days I was Popsocket-free I liked how sleek my phone looked without one... until my butterfingers kept almost dropping it and I realized I desperately need some kind of grip. I don't want to go back to a regular Popsocket with the adhesive, so maybe I'll look elsewhere for a MagSafe-compatible grip that I don't have so many gripes with.Anyway, I can't believe I said this much about a Popsocket, but here we are. Talk about first world problems. Kudos to anyone who actually made it through this lol

    I just switched from a regular phone case to a magsafe case, and wanted to still be able to use a phone grip. I was hesitant about a magnetic, $30 popsocket, but I totally get it now. The popsocket is magnetic, so you can just pull it off when you need to use your wireless charger. However, this magnet is STRONG! Like itâ€™s not going to pop off unless you get your fingernails under the rim. You can hold your phone face down, 3 feet above the ground, hanging in by just the popsocket - and it will be SECURE. I also got the magnetic car mount to go with it, and I couldnâ€™t be happier.

    Love that itâ€™s removable and you donâ€™t get stuck with sticky Popsocket goo on your case. But itâ€™s hard to get the Popsocket off for charging, even with fingernails. Trying to pull it off by pulling from the Popsocket itself only leads to the Popsocket popping out of its accordion base.The video demonstration on Popsocketâ€™s website also did not distinguish that the magnet ring is an adapter and only needs to be applied if your phone case doesnâ€™t have MagSafe. I made the foolish mistake of apply the extra magnet adapter to a MagSafe case and then putting the MagSafe Popsocket on. It was double magnet strength, which meant I needed to use a metal nail file to pop it off for charging my phone. In frustration, I debated ripping off the magnet and went back to Popsocketâ€™s website to research a replacement ring, in case I did need it after all, and thatâ€™s when I learned that the ring is for converting a regular case to a MagSafe-ready case.Needless to say, itâ€™s still hard to get this popsocket off even with removing the extra magnet adapter. Trade-off is that if the magnet was weaker, the Popsocket probably wouldn't stay on the case very well, so Iâ€™ll deal with it. Anything to avoid going back to using a regular Popsocket and traditional charging cord.

    I use this in my car and the magnet is so strong I never worry about my phone tilting or falling. Worth every penny

    I picked this color because I wanted to see my case through it. I knew that it would not be entirely clear, but the ring around the magnet is WHITE. The pop socket is clear, and so is the rest of the base, but not the outer ring. Very weird looking on my dark case. Otherwise, I love it. I always use popsockets and I like the new circular MagSafe design.

    No more pinky sores or indents, with the increasing bulk of smartphones, a product like this is almost mandatory. It's a bit annoying taking it off to place it on chargers, but that's really just a physical limitation and not the fault of the product itself. If you're thinking about it, do it, especially if your pinky ever hurts from supporting your phone.

    This is the second one I have bought. Only problem glue on knob didn't hold on my 2nd case. I just put some super glue on the knob pad and it 2did the job.

    I'm a long time PopSocket user; I love them.  But I wanted to be able to use a wireless charger with a MagSafe case.  I was skeptical this PopSocket would stay put but it's fantastically secure!  Takes some real effort to get it off at night for charging.  I still can swap out different PopSockets, same as I always did before.  I love this thing!

    I really like this pop socket- itâ€™s cute and durable! However, the instructions say you can twist off the socket part and leave the base so you can reduce bulk/ change out the socket, but I canâ€™t get it off. Iâ€™ve had others try it (others who have had pop sockets and have gotten them to work in the past) and no one can get it off. Not sure if itâ€™s defective or not but not worth replacing
