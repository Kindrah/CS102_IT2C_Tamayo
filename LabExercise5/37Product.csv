    Recently, I purchased a Victrix BFG Pro. I was skeptical, especially with it lacking vibration. I was borderline not considering it, mostly just because of that. After a few articles showing that Victrix will be adding Hall Effect Sticks in Q1 2024. Price being 40 (USD) for a pair. That's incredible pricing. So awesome upgrade. This matters because I also have a SCUF Instinct Pro Wireless (worst), Razer Wolverine Ultimate (my backup), and my new baby Victrix BFF Pro. Stock, the SCUF comes with no Hard Case. Just the basic swaps for D pad and Sticks. I had to purchase the Hard Case EXTRA, for like 40 or 50, I believe. It came with an additional cord, some additional stick top. And other little stuff. Starting left to right again, The hard case is a nice color grey and the inside is textured and looks great. It's the thinnest of the cases and for one that was paid extra in addition to the most expensive controller of the bunch at 200$ (prices are rough memory estimates). The case for the Victrix is ever so slightly thicker and only noticable if you have them side by side. Both would protect a drop in almost all cases. Inside, the Victrix has a top pocket for the EXTREMELY NICE Purple braided cord (type C to Standard USC). Also has stacked Styrofoam layers of tools and replacement parts, which includes the additional fighting pad that can be swapped with the right joy and button combo pad on the right side of the controller. The next up is the VERY sturdy and thick case. Inside is the pocket up top for the cord and the bottom houses the replacement D pades and sticks (which are held on by high power magnets and is the best setup of the three). With the information given, you'd be understandable in thinking that the SCUF was the worst of the bunch. In price? Sadly, yes. In usability? Hell no. The SCUF is my favorite to use. The reverse button placement is perfect *FOR ME*. Durability wise? Horrible, don't buy, trash, borderline a scam. Not only is SCUF already known for that, it turns out this first of the better QC lot was in fact, crap. Within the first 3 months I had to have it in for a faulty button and faulty bumper. Not a quick process since it's inconvenient to have no controller. Thankfully I'm a nerd lol. Got it back and all was golden. Then after a few months, the same button and bumper started not registering clicks either. Not every time. Just 1/10 I'd say. But you would be shocked how much is messed you up lol. Now, sitting at 14 months with it? Not great at all. 2 buttons. 1 bumper. 1 trigger. All faulty. Never dropped. No liquid anything. Kept literally in a hard case whenever it wasn't in use. I play a few hours a week total so this is minimal use. Terrible product. They will fix it. But I gotta pay for shipping and the full repair. So I'm stuck. Worst 400$ I've ever spent on controller and extras. The Victrix is so awesome. I have medium to medium/large hands lol. Not huge. They are on the CUSP of being too small. Which makes them perfect for me, but it might not be for my bigger brethren out there. I have not noticed the lack of vibration a SINGLE TIME. I even tried to pay attention for it and still didn't notice it. So I guess that's neat lolol. It feels light yet sturdy. It's what you would want for long sessions. Light weight and upgradable/repairable. Victrix doesn't sell replacements of anything yet, that I've noticed. But everything points to Q1 for the start of all that. I've been XBOX my whole life so my brain is struggling with the PlayStation symbols. Sell the XB setup for extra. Just a different single paddle. I'd be so happy. This is my go to by a mile. The Razer Wolverine Ultimate is a wonderful controller. The button placement on the back is TERRIBLE. That's all personal preference so I won't knock it for it. Build is solid. Can't speak for other products of theirs. It's very heavy in comparison. By a chunky margin. But it works great. Feels great. Way cheaper in price but not quality at all. They did a great job with that line. So I'd saySCUF - 6Vicxtrix - 9Razer - 7.5/8

    So I'll start with the best and main feature: The modular face. I can't stress how awesome this thing is for players like me that struggle to find button/dpag/analog setups that work for the way we like to play. For example, I play claw style, so having the 6-button option is a must. Need to go back to play a game where 4-button makes more sense? No problem, just swap the pieces, which is super easy. And those units can be flipped, so for instance, I like the dpad in the top-left most position (by default, that's where the analog stick is, like what you see in the picture), so I simply flipped it. When I'm playing, I also hate having the analog stick in the way, again, no problem, just pops right off (and you get extras).This modular feature is important because if you play enough, eventually buttons and dpads go out. For a long time, I was using the Hori FC4 (original design), which was a great controller and fairly inexpensive, but the one drawback was that it broke down pretty fast. Pro players that use the dualshock will tell you they replace them every several months, at most. Although I haven't seen it yet, I have to imagine that Victrix will sell the face pieces separately, which will eventually not only give players like me the ability to easily and cheaply replace wornout components, but it opens the door for more designs for those pieces in the future.Otherwise, it has a bunch of other premium features. You can go wired, which for many of us is really important, and the wire is nice and sturdy. Same with the case for the controller and all the various pieces to it. It has a built-in feature to program (or turn off) the back-grip buttons, and multiple profile options, so even though there is an app that allows for more input customization (which is also a rad feature), you don't need that to do some basic input customization. It also has built-in trigger stops, which is amazing, and a tournament mode to disable your system buttons and the touchpad. The pad has a nice, heavy weight to it, too.Before I got this thing, it was clear it was designed for tournament play in mind. The question I had was whether the dpad(s) would be any good. I use the old, basic, Nintendo cross-style and so far it's working really well. All of the other features, too, are highly-desirable when in a tournament setting, and they function great. But, they went beyond that to ensure that if you want to use it like a normal, casual controller, you clearly can.So I'll say that at this point it seems the wait was worth it, but I'll end with a caveat: This isn't a casual controller. The price tag should probably tell you that, but I can easily see certain people being disappointed with this thinking it's going to be good for casual use. You really have to be thinking about a competitive setting to see the value you're getting with this pad's features. This controller is comparable in quality to something like the Razer Wolverine v2 but has way better features for competitive play and practice, yet the Wolverine is $70 more. I've used the Victrix for casual gaming already and I can tell you it works great there, too, but unless you're taking advantage of all the features that a non-competitive game *isn't* going to use, then this is probably too expensive.Ultimately, a fantastic controller.EDIT: The Victrix Control Hub now works with the BFG, so that eliminates one criticism I had. Now the only thing left for them to address is replacement parts for the modular pieces. This could be make or break though: I've asked them about this and for now even requesting parts directly is not an option. The clock is ticking on that because when everyone starts to have breakdowns, no one is paying for a brand new BFG when a piece that should be really replaceable can't be replaced. That's going to wreck this thing's reputation.

    this controller is probably the best alternative to the Elite Series 2 so far, at least until MS releases Elite Series 3 with a share button. It has a good grip and it fits nicely on my hand, and is overall a solid controller. the hot-swappable buttons are a great addition and would merit at least an extra .5 star on this review if you are on the market for a new pad to play fighting games on.the problem with that is that the buttons are a bit TOO sensitive: I still have to find a resting position that don't activate one of the triggers. The Sticks also lack a bit of mechanical resistance, so any flick of the thumb sends you spinning. for Fighters and more action heavy games (such as high speed hack n slashes), this means you will probably be battling the analog stick as much as the opponent, at least for a while. The d-pad is the way to go here, but all three options need a bit of time to get used to. My personal choice is the 8-directional one, you have to learn to touch it lightly.Then there is the software, which is a bit clunky, but get the job done. On the first day there was a bug that wouldn't let you re-assing the triggers buttons, but that is fixed now. so at least you can be sure Victrix is still improving it.This one will be my daily driver until MS releases the Elite 3.

    i love the idea of this controller but the execution is worth about $40, not $180. quick pros and cons:+modular controller-except for the right side, which arbitrarily can't be swapped Wii U/Steam Deck style and instead gets an awkwardly positioned six-button pad-needs a tool to actually change things around, unlike every other similar controller-blatantly inadequate alternate sticks - only one convex stick, only one long stick. why??+four well-placed back buttons-they're ludicrously over-sensitive compared to better, sturdier implementations (KK3, Steam Deck), making them worse than useless for most people-no alternate back button options like the KK3, Xbox Elite, etc so i hope you have the exact same finger length as i do, otherwise you're boned+decent build quality, most of it probably won't fall apart any time soon and it feels good in the hand-except for the sticks, which aren't hall effect, so enjoy 100% inevitable stick drift on your $180 controller.-still not as nice feeling as Microsoft or Sony's high end controllers (though both of those also have issues)-no motion control at this price is absurd-no rumble at this price is inexcusable-weirdly sensitive bumpers and triggers, though i personally got used to it-poorly implemented trigger pull depth customization, though to be fair, i've never seen this done decently. honestly, if non-analog triggers is something you really want for a game, just get a switch controller and a converter.-xbox version is the same price as ps version despite having no touchpad (actually 5 bucks more as of this writing lmao)with all these downsides the only use case i can see for this is fighting game tournaments, and even then there's far better options for far less money. it's true that you can buy replacement sticks and d-pads for this, but you could buy a new saturn controller and EIGHT replacements for the same price as this controller - that's with zero replacement parts - and have an infinitely superior fighting pad with far more longevity. if this was $140 cheaper it'd be a decent buy for some people, but at this price it's absolutely terrible

    Only owned a few weeks. Nice to have a controller without the annoying inline thumb sticks for the PS5. A little overpriced, but then maybe not due to battery life alone vs the PS5 controllers. The PS5 default controller has 8-10 hours of use with vibration off. The DualSense Edge for $200 only has 6 hrs of battery life (what the ____). The Victrix controller so far is averaging 20hrs. Another plus is that the charging cable is 9.75 ft long, if one wants to keep it plugged in, which I do not. To me, the best controller is the Elite/Core controller. The victrix controller is as close as it gets on the PS5. For battery life alone I would suggest this controller over the PS5 controllers. The only nitpicky complaint so far I have about this controller is the triggers, they curl out at the bottom more so than any controller I’ve ever used. If a person uses one set of fingers for the bumpers/triggers it is a moot point. If a person uses two sets of fingers for the bumpers/triggers, that will be an adjustment for some. This controller has no vibrating motors built in, which is fine with me. On all my controllers I cut off the vibration features due to extreme drain on the batteries, combined with I find them annoying to add. Betting Sony is not allowing 3rd party controllers to have vibrating motors. No 3rd party controller does so far for the PS5. Pretty sure that is not a coincidence which is fine with me, but may not be for some.

    Controller is S-tier in almost every category of things.I'm going to go over the incredibly short list of cons before I go over the list of pros;- won't turn on your PS5 (you can use your TV remote if you have a TV from this decade).- currently doesn't have an app or software, so you have to change button configurations manuallyNOW FOR THE LONG LIST OF PROS:The ergonomics and overall design/engineering is honestly far superior to any other PS5 or even Xbox controller on the market.  It is a HIGH QUALITY, WELL-DESIGNED controller meant for LONG SESSIONS or tournament play.- Configuring back buttons and profiles is super easy, so is everything else, I'll add a link on how to use all the features at the end of this review.- The back buttons feel better than any other controller I've ever held, to include the new Razer, the Scufs, the Elite Series 2 (which are my #2 favorite paddles now).- The D-Pads are wonderful, not loud and clicky like razers but have a nice muted feedback to them, I prefer the hybrid d-pad or the Victrix d-pad.- Super easy to swap out thumb sticks and modules and rotate them.  Thumbsticks feel great, the longer one is impressive for FPS/TPS.- Triggers are sensitive, require very little actuation force.  Super reactive, really a 10/10, trigger stops seem more like they have 3 stopping points than 5, but still super easy to use.  Triggers are also textured for grip, but very soft.- The grips on the controller are perfect.- 2 Year warranty as opposed to other companies.- Customer support is better than any of the other companies who I've ordered controllers from.- l1/r1 buttons have a different feel than any other button on the controller, very similar to mouseclicks.- Controller is LIGHT.  This will not hurt your hands after a 10 hour play session.Every single button/stick/interface on this controller is designed with comfort and efficiency in mind.It is SIGNIFICANTLY better than any other PS5 Pro Controller Alternative.  Its ergonomics alone make it better than the Razer Pro (F-tier design, and FFF tier customer support).  The Dualsense Edge only has two paddles, and a three hour battery life, which also make it an unworthy comparison.  While SCUF's quality is nice, they have a 6-month warranty period, and are SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive.  SCUF also modifies the DS5 as opposed to building a god-tier controller from the ground up.I've used this controller on both my PS5 and PC and must say that I've yet to experience a better controller.And this review is BEFORE they've even released the software for it.  I can't wait to see what that's going to be like!Link to their instructions;  https://support.pdp.com/hc/en-us/articles/11045034301325-Victrix-Pro-BFG-Wireless-Controller-for-PS5-PS4-and-PC-User-Guide

    Pros: The controller is very comfortable, it has great d-pad options & the diamond d-pad itself is the best I ever used; the buttons feel nice on press too. It's great for PC and the Steam app. The case it comes with is very good; I love the fact that you can switch around controller styles & you can make the analog sticks have octagon gates. It was built with many different types of people in mind. I like the fact that this controller was designed & intended for the type of people who don't want to switch between 2 or more different types of controllers to play a variety of games. This controller is very close to perfection in my opinion and Victrix could make the next installment even better if done with even more types of people in mind.Cons: Too expensive, no bluetooth, it's very annoying when you have to use the screwdriver everytime you wanna change the style, and you can't remove the 4 back buttons when not in use. Out the box you'll see that the triggers are super sensitive and activates at times you dont want them to because you slightly pressed them. The software isnt helpful when it comes to the triggers; if you wanna play sfv or any 6-button fighting game, you can't make the R1 & R2 into L1 & L2. This is because as of the time of this review, you cant change what the trigger buttons do in the software app; this could be fixed with a simple update. THE MECHANISMS FOR THE TRIGGER LEVELSp ARE THE WORST DESIGN EVER!! It's annoying to change the trigger levels and a pain to set it to the middle level. Everytime I play a game my finger would accidentally touch/slide across the trigger switcher and it cause the trigger to reset to the default trigger position. In the software app I have the triggers set to activate at the very bottom of a press; so when the sensitive trigger mechanism gets touched & resets the triggers to the top position, the game wouldn't recognize my fingers pressing the triggers down unless I switched it back to the bottom position. When this happens while I play online in a fighting game, I have to stop playing and fix the triggers back to the position where the game will recognize it again; and while I'm fixing all this my opponent gets a bunch of free hits on my character. When this happens every time you begin to realize that this controller is unplayable unless you get rid of the trigger lock mechanism. I very much think this controller should have trigger locks but just not this specific one that this controller has built into it. This controller is too expensive for its flaws.Opinion:This is a cool controller, the case along with the other accessories you get inside the box are all useful and it gives you alot to test with. The diamond d-pad is my favorite part about this controller, it just feels great when playing online in fighting games. I definitely want Victrix to make more fightpads in the future, but the software app customization should be more like 8bitdo and the trigger lock switches should be like the xbox elite controller. It's too expensive for the amount of flaws and frustration it causes. I thought this controller would be the fightpad to make me feel like I could stop searching for a perfect controller to use for fighting games, but that's not the case here. I did see a few youtuber reviews who also agree that this controller isn't worth the high price and that there are too many flaws. There are also tons of youtubers praising this controller and I just wanted to share my experience. I honestly think Victrix can improve on these flaws and make an even better controller in the future; I do like the options it offers but not the execution. For the current price you can probably find more affordable & less stressful options. In my attached review photo; the red controller next to the Victrix pro bfg is an Aliexpress controller that I got in June 2022 for $25-30. It has a great d-pad, the button presses are responsive and works with whatever fighting game you like; I highly recommend it, just search fightpad on Aliexpress and you should see it. At most this is not a bad controller it's just too expensive, if this controller was $100 or less and had the same issues, I probably wouldn't have written so much in this review tbh. If you don't wanna spend almost $200 for a fightpad, then I'm sure you can find cheaper alternatives.

    To get the pros out of the way, it's compact, feels so great in the hands, has decent weight, and buttons are very response. D-Pad isn't clicky, but it still feels solid and the LR bumpers almost feel like mouse clicks. The controller overall is VERY robust.Onto the cons.Con 1: The BIGGEST defect of my unit was when I try to place the left module in the PS layout, I literally cannot move left or down, but I can move up and right. When I put it back in the Xbox layout, no issues whatsoever. This is a PROBLEM. Yes, I prefer the Xbox layout in some games, but other games the PS layout just works. The selling point of this controller is that it can do both layouts, and my unit can only do Xbox. It's unacceptable. Whether it was wired or wireless, nothing fixed this at all, not even updating the controller and the USB hub (the hub requires its own separate update). I'm convinced the module itself is defective.Con 2: This morning, the left trigger stopped working. I had to completely tamper with it by making it fully extend and setting it to trigger stop a few times before I got it working again. This is a bad sign that it's going to get worse.Con 3: Somehow in some way, while I was playing an FPS game, my controller froze and my camera spun endlessly. Unplugging the USB hub and plugging it back in didn't fix it. I had to reboot the entire computer.Con 4: The Controller App for PC IS NOT AVAILABLE! Why? The back buttons are all set to buttons that I have no clue of. Only after about 20 minutes of guessing, I manage to set my ideal actions to the buttons (not set the buttons to my actions). Without the app, I cannot even run tests on what's going on with the left module of the controller. I can only attribute it to a defect. However, as long as the stick calibration and troubleshooting features of the app are not available, I will never know why the left module won't work in the PS layout.Con 5 (nitpick): I use a KontrolFreek foam ring around the right stick for the purpose of having more control over my aim. However, since the long joystick is metal, the foam ring tends to slip upward and makes no contact with the base. While we're on this topic, KontrolFreek caps do not fit, so don't bother.Conclusion: Keep in mind that these are pre-order controllers, and launch models tend to be more of a prototype for future revisions. With that said, had this controller been working as Victrix designed it to work, it would be the best controller BAR NONE! However, now is not its time. More work needs to be done to fix these issues and the software still isn't available, anyway. Overlook this controller. The bad reviews on this option are within reason.Hope this helps.Verdict: RETURNED!!!!11

    When my son expressed his desire for a new controller for his PS5, I knew it was the perfect opportunity to make his Christmas extra special. He had been eyeing a controller that promised not only enhanced gameplay but also the ability to customize every aspect to his liking. So, I made it my mission to find the perfect controller that would take his gaming experience to new heights.On Christmas morning, as he unwrapped the gift, his eyes lit up with excitement. The glow on his face was priceless as he held the new controller in his hands, eager to put it to the test. Without wasting a moment, he dashed upstairs to his gaming setup, ready to dive into a world of endless possibilities.After spending some time with the controller, I couldn’t help but inquire about his experience. His response was nothing short of enthusiastic. He described how the controller’s full customizability allowed him to adjust the joystick height and customize the appearance of the d-pad to suit his preferences. The addition of four programmable buttons on the back opened up a whole new realm of possibilities, giving him the freedom to assign functions according to his gameplay style.Admittedly, there was a slight learning curve when it came to using the additional paddles, but he quickly adapted and found them to be incredibly useful once mastered. Despite this initial adjustment period, he couldn’t praise the controller enough for its performance and versatility.As days turned into weeks and weeks into months, the new controller became a staple in his gaming arsenal. Its seamless compatibility with not only the PS5 but also Xbox and PC made it a go-to choice for any gaming platform. Whether he was embarking on epic adventures solo or teaming up with friends for multiplayer battles, the controller never failed to deliver a top-notch gaming experience.In conclusion, the controller has proven to be a game-changer in every sense of the word. Its customizable features, combined with its compatibility across multiple platforms, make it a must-have for any serious gamer looking to elevate their gameplay. My son wholeheartedly recommends this product to anyone seeking to take their gaming to the next level. With this controller in hand, the possibilities are endless, and the fun never stops.

    The updating program was a pain to use cuz it wouldn't recognize the controller if steam somehow recognizes it first. After I found a solution online it was resolved. After that it was mostly a smooth experience with the controller. Buttons and sticks feel great. The wireless mode practically has no noticable lag. Battery life is great. Ergonomically feels great to hold and the back buttons are responsive and easily programmable within the controller without the need of opening up the app/program to adjust it. Switching out the buttons/joysticks is very easy. It has no rumble but that is something I can love without to be honest.I only have 2 complaints. The buttons for the fight pad variation feels too low for me personally. It's kinda off center and a bit low reaching. Second complaint is that the triggers are extremely sensitive. You cannot rest your fingers at all on the triggers unless you want to risk accidentally pressing them. Wish they had a bit more tension to avoid that. A work around I found was to just adjust the deadzones on the triggers about half way so it's more manageable. I did this with the program on my computer that you download for this controller. The deadzones might reset when you switch the trigger locks on tho so be aware of that. If that happens just go back into  the app/program on your pc and repeat the process. Kind of an annoyance I know. Overall a good controller so far.

    Bought the Victrix Pro BFG and Dualsense Edge a few days apart with intentions of keeping only one. Honestly leaning towards the BFG as for my purposes it's just better. I have mainly played on Xbox for the past 3 console generations so I'm very familiar with the stick layout. I have gotten used to the Sony layout but still I have 8-9yrs on the Xbox layout. Also the battery life just blows the Edge away. The BFG averages around 20hrs per charge while the Edge is 4-5. Turning off the vibration and haptics to mirror the BFG still only gets like 6-7. That is on a brand new controller. I'd hate to see the battery life after a year with degradation. The Edge does feel more premium despite being $20-$25 more. Still they both feel great to me even when I switch the BFG to the Sony control layout. That freedom and better battery life will most likely be my determining factors in keeping the BFG over the Edge.Update 4/8/24: Went against my gut instinct and returned my BFG and kept the Dualsense Edge. Used it for 2 weeks and did decently but still noticably worse than I did with the BFG. Ended up buying another BFG and my first game back on Apex I dropped 10 kills and team won the match. My accuracy is just much better with the BFG. No matter what I change on the Edge, the BFG just feels better in hand to me. I do use it in the Sony layout with traditional d-pad and it just works. Plus back to having 20hr battery life is just a quality of life thing. Definitely recommend the BFG especially for shooters. For other games I use the Edge of standard Dualsense.

    The bottom buttons just don't work for my hands. I can't be harsh since it's a tall order to have double paddles line up right for everyone's fingers. My pinky wouldn't even fit on the controller so it wasn't an option to combine both middle and ring fingers on the paddles without accidentally pressing one of them. I tried using a single finger on each side for the paddles but the way I held or adjusted my controller grip during different gameplay moments just made it too inconsistent for which paddle should be the main or secondary functions. I then tried mapping both paddles to the same button but that resulted in too many double clicks happening. Disabling one or the other wasn't quite working for me since my finger resting point shifted at times.Also the lower of the 2 lower paddles is too easy to press on accident when picking up the controller after a cutscenes rest.I think it would be better if the power paddles were spaced apart where one was something like a trigger shaped button under the middle of the controller for the middle fingers while the other is a single paddle for the rings. Thing is I might think that but the controller size might be a limiting factor regardlessLast thing is in a game where the bumpers (r1 l1) requires holding will register a release since the bumpers got some wobble to it as your hands try to handle two joysticks and bottom buttons while holding. This is something I can actually regard as a universal design flaw not specific to my individual hand size or finger lengths.

    DISCLAIMER This is all my opinion, I'm sure there will be plenty of people who will love this product. My review is focused on the XBOX version, so I am comparing it to other XBOX controllers.TLDR I recommend the Gamesir G7 SE over this product  (+) already has hall effect thumbsticks  (+) paddles are more comfortable due to being flush with the shell and bigger  (+) easily available 3rd party interchangeable thumbsticks, easy to attach and very cheap  (+) actual controller is a fraction of the cost of typical premium controllersVictrix Pro BFG paddles  (-) not flush with the shell, flush paddles allow you to grip the controller better  (-) paddles are smaller to accomodate 4, better to have 2 paddles which are larger face buttons (A, B, X, Y)  (-) only the fight pad module has mechanical switches, everything else is membrane  (-) too close together because the spacing is limited by the size of the module start/select/share buttons  (+) large and easy to press, critical for games where you frequently access menus d-pad buttons  (+) large and easy to hit direction you want triggers  (+) large and easy for your finger to press at any position clutch  (+) easy to adjust trigger pull lengths bumpers  (+) easy to click for your finger at any position thumbsticks  (+) easy to change thumbsticks  (-) not hall effect  (-) I personally couldn't be as accurate as my other controllers  (-) not grippy at all  (-) tiniest thumbstick surface area out of all XBOX controllers I have used remapping  (+) easy to do through app or directly on the controller  (-) missing options on app like customizing thumbstick response curves audio settings  (-) has to be set through app instead of XBOX audio settings, which is easier audio quality  (~) I use astro mixamp so I can't comment on the audio quality color  (+) black and purple looks really good, probably one of the nicest looking XBOX  Controllers.

    The Good:  This is by far the most responsive, decisive controller I've ever purchased, with excellent remappable buttons for all buttons and triggers, not just the typical 4 buttons, Triangle, Circle, X, and Square PS style, or A, B, X, Y.  The 2 triggers used for driving games (Rocket League) can be adjusted to the level of depression as well, which makes dribbling in Rocket League much easier (I play Rocket League Primarily).  The joysticks are extremely easy to move, making sharp turns the fastest I've ever been able to accomplish, which is very important in Rocket League to cut off the ball, or turn fast when close to the ball.  The included accessories and case are top notch.  The dongle for PC eliminates the need for Bluetooth pairing, which is a great plus, as pairing Bluetooth constantly and issues with that is eliminated as well.The Bad:  The thumb grips on the control sticks could use a more rubbery surface to prevent thumb slippage while maneuvering fast, this is a problem with almost all controllers really on the market.  Also, the controller is made for small to average sized hands sadly, as that's the biggest issue I have with it.  I have very large hands, and the ends of the grips end in the middle of my palms versus a full grip that the Sonicon controller which is much larger than a standard PS4/5 controller that fits my hands superbly.  If the PDP Victrix Pro BFG was made at least 1/3rd larger in size, it would accommodate the hands of more people, particularly adults who would be the primary purchaser of such an expensive controller, but well worth it due to the GOOD that I previously mentioned.  I'd gladly pay 50 dollars more or even higher for a larger controller exactly like this present one.  I hope other companies follow Sonicon's lead in making controllers larger, as smaller controllers with back paddles that can be remapped are out of place for those of us with medium to larger sized hands.Overall:  This is easily the best controller I've ever purchased, even with it size issue, I'm learning to place my hands to make it work.  Grip extenders do not work sadly, as the shape of the grips being angular rather than round, do not fit and come off shortly after applying.  Perhaps they could make a version with the ability to extend the grips by an add on would help solve the problem for large handed individuals, but that wouldn't address the buttons being smaller or the placement of the back paddles which would still be out of place.  The real solution would be to make this same controller, just in a larger size for big handed individuals.  Till someone does address this issue, like Sonicon did (my previously favorite controller due to its size and responsiveness), I'll have to deal with the current market's limitations on their smaller sized controllers.Update:  It's JUST TOO SMALL!  I cannot adapt to this tiny controller built for children obviously or small adults.  Playing Rocket League I'm constantly backflipiping due to the buttons being too close together for my larger than a child's sized thumb.  Very frustrating trying to make it work, but in the end, this controller is flat out too small to use effectively for an adult, unless you have puny hands and fingers.  The search for an adult sized excellent controller for Rocket League continues sadly.  On to the next.

    Used it for SF6 only. Used the 6 button module on right and the thumb pad module on left. Buttons are snappy and responsive on front, top and rear. The customization software is pretty straightforward and user friendly. Switching the modules is easy with the provided tool and the case you get is cool. However, it’s too expensive for how it’s made. The silicon conductive pad under the d pad wore out in less than 6 months. The down position down right tore. Up and forward creased and was on the way to tearing as well. Waste of money since you can’t even buy replacement modules which is a huge point of a modular system. Also, 6 button module buttons need to be spaced further to the right and between each other. Could be a little bigger but that would be preference. Took awhile to get use to the setup bc of the spacing which meant many missed/wrong inputs solely due to that. Their customer service was also not very friendly or helpful when I reached out leaving me with a controller that I can’t use for what I needed which is just sitting on my desk. Very disappointed. Had to spend more money on another controller to get all I needed plus one that wouldn’t break down in 3 months. Bought the Haute 42 and been great since. Until they drop the price, improve the build quality of the thumb pad and offer modules for purchase while improving their customer support, DO NOT BUY. You can’t even buy a conductive pad to replace the one in the controller bc it’s not the size of any other PS4/5 or Xbox controller. Avoid the headache

    It might be a little early to wright a review but I think its the best controller I've ever had.  Just keep in mind I've only had this a couple of days.  Feels great in my hands.  The back buttons are in the right spots.  The sticks feel really nice.  I got the dead zones totally zeroed out.I have about 1700 hours playing Wreckfest so, maybe I'll update my review after I get some time in.  So far I'm very impressed.

    First off, if you play fighting games on pad, the Victrix is the best PS5 option currently. The Hori Octa Fighting Commander is fine in every way except for where it counts most - the D-Pad. It's way too small.The Victrix BFG here, has a WAY better D-Pad that is also customizable per ones taste. The fight button module is rather clicky, as it should be. The extra back triggers/paddles can be a bit too easy to accidentally hit, or at least the lower 2 are - so I disabled them in the software. The software itself is kinda finicky, but I set it up once and never had an issue again.For reference, I play Guilty Gear Strive, and so far I have made considerably less input errors on this pad compared to the Hori. 623 inputs always come out, although half circle inputs for supers can be finicky if I do them too fast (might be a me problem. I bound the back paddles to RC and dash Macros, and so far I haven't had any issues with hitting the wrong triggers.I would definitely recommend this to people who want a dedicated PS5 pad, although the price by itself can be hard to overcome if you just set it up for Fighting games and never swap modules like I do. This, I must give it 4 stars.

    Bought this to play fighting games on both the PC and PS5. I haven't tried it on any other type of games yet. I'm torn to give this 3 or 4 stars. My first impressions were not that good after unboxing and immediately thought I was going to just return it. I think the price holds it back from being 4 star. Should be like $140-$160 range imo. Saw a review video where the guy was flexing the controller and it sounded horrible - like it could break easily. Mine feels very solid and doesn't make those noises.The bad: Picking it up it feels ok - not cheap, but not premium or 'pro' either. The plastic feels a little sub-par all the way around the controller and the textured creator/option/function buttons look too aggressive gamer-y with the carbon fiber looking grooves. It just adds to the 'cheap looking' factor imo. It has a slower response time than most ps5 controllers running at 125hz locked polling rate which is ~8ms input lag. Main buttons on the default layout (right thumbstick and 4 main buttons) and the triggers feel ok not great. No rumble/haptics/speaker so maybe don't use this controller for ps5 exclusives. The fightpad is awesome, but very clicky (louder) buttons - Think it is going for the fight stick vibe tho which is a 'louder' way to play, but to me it just adds to the 'not pro' feeling.The good: Very comfortable in the hands and light weight. Installation and firmware update was easy. The app from the MS store works fine. The extra buttons underneath are very easy to configure on the fly or with the app. 3 profiles can be saved on the controller. Supposedly long battery life, but I can't comment on that or the wireless yet since I've only used this wired for now. 10ft long usb-c to usb-a cable that feels well built. The fightpad is actually very fun to use. The buttons feel good and tried along with the octagon gate for the left thumbstick and it was surprisingly very accurate.My Opinion: Overall, it's a kind of niche controller. While I do see the potential for fps games, if I didn't play fighting games I would just return it. Could also pickup a real fight stick for a similar price that works with both the PS5 and PC. Recommend to wait for a sale if you're interested. I hope the developers create better add-ons with higher quality stock buttons/thumbsticks and replacement parts for what we are all using now. The accuracy of this controller while I was playing fighting games does make it feel 'pro' at times.My Wish: I wish pro controllers looked more professional instead of cheap looking aggressive gamer wannabe carbon fiber buttons or the purple Fightpad text on the fightpad. Professional controllers are (usually) for adults. We don't really need the flashy lights or text or grills or whatever - just function and form in a clean build with solid components. To be fair, the controller isn't ugly, but it could look so much better.

    I've been eyeing this controller for a long time, and decided to splurge a bit. I was not disappointed at all by how it performed. Everything from the case, to the fit and finish felt premium. It's an awesome piece of hardware, that basically felt like I unlocked godmode in shooters. It reacted quickly, the controls were super tight. Even being able to custom set the trigger depth was intuitive, and paddles were excellently placed. Unfortunately I had two issues that made it a no go for me.The big one was the connectivity on my PC. Installed the app, and it did not recognize the controller. Is it something that I could have figured out given more time? Most likely. After paying for a premium product that is advertised as PC compatible I shouldn't have to jump through hoops. The second was the lack of vibration features. I thought I could  do without them, but it just felt lifeless. Also there are times where its necessary. It's def geared toward competitive players.The next iteration coming has these features included, with hall effect modules becoming available separately soon. I'm holding out for one of those, and it will likely be the absolute greatest controller ever

    really needs some extra button options. microswitches for the 4 face button + analog stick section would have been nice. extra bumpers instead of backside triggers would have been nice (like razer wolverine).no connectivity to standard xbox attachments like the chatpad. not sure why dolby audio was considered a priority when this was developed.  no rgb for xbox button.triggers are VERY sensitive - config to add deadzone is great option in the app. unfortunately, this company has 2 different controller apps on the xbox store. why? and why does one of them require register/ signup FROM WITHIN THE APP to an email address? to do controller config?

    I’ve been using other pro controllers pretty consistently for the past few years. This is by far the most weird? controller I’ve used. The looks of it are good. However it feels very cheap and is very light even compared to regular dualsense or even dual shock 4 controllers. No rumble features which is fine by me. I usually turn off vibration anyway in FPS games. No haptic triggers either which again is fine by me. However the cheap feels of the controller and the USB dongle for no latency issues along with the included fight layout module make me feel this is mainly a fight pad rather then a “pro” controller for shooters. I’m not sure if it was my luck but upon opening the box for the first time I could smell a strong smell of plastic and even after playing for about 3 hours it left a new plastic smell on my hands which I did not like. Not to mention that a modular controller has no separate modules for sale in case of stick drift which will definitely happen as the sticks are analog. The trigger locks are also very weird to set up as it has no presets in place. You kinda have to push down then release a button to do it and it’s just so weird and seems very inconvenient to switch them on the fly. I also find the smaller touch pad a bit annoying, I don’t know why but it’s just super small compared to the ps4/5 controller. At the end of the day I think it’s okay for what it is. IMO not worth the near 200 dollar price point tho.

    I find on PS5 that the sticks are very, almost too sensitive.  I have a PS5 Edge and can adjust the stick sensitivity but am told the only way to do some stick sensitivty adjustment for Victrix is to have it hooked up to PC?  This seems a hassel as it puts you in a different environment than the PS5 guessing on setting stick sensitivity correctly.  Why does Victrix not have an app to address adjustments on PS5 like Edge?

    Pros: This is a pro controller that allows you to customize your game play like no other controller on the market. If you like to play PS version of controller you have that option. If you prefer Xbox style. You have that option. Arcade style you have that option as well! and software for updates to your controller. There's a button for PS and PC. PC will give you Xbox (A,B,X,Y) output on your screen.Cons: Back buttons don't feel comfortable while playing. I find myself pushing them unnecessarily. I unmapped them since its easy to press them on accident.

    This is a great controller in my opinion, the d pad is excellent, the controller is modular, response time is excellent and battery life is excellent.  However, the software doesn't work on windows 11, the triggers are uncomfortable, your fingers keep on hitting the trigger adjustment button which gets annoying after a while, Instructions are confusing and it doesn't have vibration motors (for those who like them) and the six button module has the buttons too close together so more spacein between the buttonsis needed. All in all a great experience. I have always wanted a six button controller. This goes above and beyond my expectations

    The first controller I received was cutting in and out when I got it, and completely died within 30 minutes of opening. I had to RMA it. The new one works fine, thankfully.Pros:- The module switching feature works well, and is easy to do. Being able to bring one controller on a trip and still having access to a 2-stick layout as well as the fightpad layout is awesome.- The adjustable triggers work well, I find myself liking different setups for different games and its easy to switch them on the fly.- Tournament lock mode works well.- The case is nice.Cons:- I have serious durability concerns with this controller. The build quality feels cheap, and I already have a number of dings/scrapes on different parts. Nothing yet has functionally broken, but it seems like its only a matter of time.- The dpads are not very easy to switch out. For the smallest cross-shaped one, I had to pry it out with a screwdriver and that marred the plastic on both the dpad and the controller.- The software is slow and buggy. Nothing works quite right, and certain fields seem to reset upon opening the software, so that I have to change them every time or my controller won't be configured correctly once I close the software.- Three profiles is not enough for a controller with this much configuration. I think adding more profiles with software would be nice.Overall this gets a 3 star because I will continue to use it and be (mostly) happy with it's functionality. However, the build quality issues and software problems mean I cannot go higher than that.

    I’m a fighting game player and bought this thinking that the DPAD would perform better than the dual sense edge. But it does not, cool concept with the interchangeable buttons, and the fight stick pad is awesome too. But without a better performing d pad this isn’t very useful to me. Great concept, build quality not as bad as ppl say, also comes with a nice case, but you can’t call this a fight stick without a functional Dpad so for me, this gets 3 stars for effort but poor execution.

    The only knocks I have on this controller are that the triggers are too sensitive (I admittedly haven't checked if this can be adjusted) and it's too easy to accidentally hit the buttons that allow you to adjust the trigger stops undoing where you had them set

    First of all... To me, it has a great build in standard ps5 button layout... Very responsive, and comfortable for 1st person shooters... (COD) With that being said, I brought this controller specifically for fighting games because of it's fight stick layout and unfortunately this is it's major downfall imo... The fight pad buttons feel great but the layout is not centered right in comparison to other fight sticks or lack there of out there. Also with the 6 button layout, I was quite surprised that the R1 and R2 which is on the fight pad it's self are mirrored with the R1 and R2 at the top of the stick where as other pads in the past, the top buttons can be used for L1 and L2 on the right side of the stick... The D pads which has different options to choose from are nothing to right home about and as a amputee (left hand) this was also a major disappointment.... There has never been a D pad greater than the SNES D pad imo and when developer's are making these pads they should model it as their blueprint.... Hopefully Victrix will have some updates especially with the top triggers to map them the way you want them mapped comfortably.... Not bad but not great and at it's price point I would wait for updates or wait for a competent hori fight stick to hit the market....

    Feels good I just would like it a lot more if the remappable buttons on the back could be taken off when not needed. I'm using it for ps5 for referenc. OK so R2 L2 are hair or full triggers if yours comes with triggers in hair mode use the two buttons on the back that slide and while holding them to the side compress the triggers and hold them then release the buttons on the back and they should be in full use mode it re engage the hair trigger just slide the buttons back over without them compressed. Second it has another button on the back for wired or wireless mode wired speaks for itself wireless you have to use the USB receiver that came in the controllers case and make sure have the button on top the controller on the left in the mode you need ps5, ps4, pc. No mic on the controller just jack for headphones. No trigger feedback or rumble. But I absolutely enjoy playing with this more than any typical dualshock. The left thumb stick position always bugged me. Buttons feel good could feel better. In wireless mode u can use it both on cord or not while it charges. I just have long finger so the remappable buttons get accidentally touched at times. I've had it one day I'll update if something else is worth mentioning

    The manual doesnt really offer too much on how to replace parts with the substitute pieces, pretty responsive controller. the triggerstoppers are a great but sometimes they dont register the clicks, they’re also a bit uneven, not a drastic difference but once you notice the difference it can bother you. Other than that great controller for casual and pro use!

    I bought this 'cuz I needed a fightpad, and have been disappointed by all the ones to come out for the last two console generations (except PDP's MKX Fightpad, and the Hori Fighting Commander [NOT Octa]).  The d-pad's not quite as responsive as I'd like, and tends to ignore diagonals during speedy motion inputs (and mine are pretty speedy).  I'd also prefer the back paddles to just not be there, but you can disable them, so that's good.  But when using the fightpad component, you can't change the right shoulder buttons to something else without changing them on the face of the fightpad component as well, so they just become utterly redundant.If you're using analog and want to use the octagonal gate to make your inputs cleaner that way, don't bother (just get a Hori Fighting Commander OCTA), 'cuz the alignment of it is sorta...diagonal.  The cardinal directions aren't where they should be, unless I just snapped it in wrong.  Doesn't feel like I did, though.But if you want a good controller for general gaming purposes, you could do worse.  But you can also just buy a much cheaper controller that's just as good, or maybe even better (DualShock/Sense d-pads are still the best d-pads, though this one does come close).Overall, I can't really recommend this controller.  Cool idea, just suboptimal execution at too steep an asking price.

    10 week, 100+ hour review:It’s been a good “pro” controller so far. I haven’t had many problems at all with it. There was one time that it disconnected while in the middle of a match but just that once. No issues with stick drift so far.I have average/medium size hands and it fits them comfortably. The back buttons are excellent, I only wish they were mechanical buttons. The placements of them are perfect though. I really  hope they or another company end up selling hall effect stick replacement modules. Or at the very least I hope they make regular replacement modules availableIt doesn’t feel cheap to me like some reviews have stated. I’m not sure where they are getting that. Opinions huh.I love the short travel option on the triggers. They work well and it’s the only configuration I use them in.I updated the controller and dongle with the windows app and there has seemingly been a good improvement on battery life.Overall I’m happy with it but there is room for improvement.

    This controller is phenomenal and awful at the same time.Cons: First of all the build, this is one of the cheapest ""pro"" controller ever. It feels cheap the triggers sound like cheap plastic. Like if dropped it would crack cheap. It feels like the 3rd party controllers of the past that were $40 to $60. For almost $200 with taxes it should not feel this cheap.The L2 and R2 Triggers are in an awful spot and hard to not press when you are running in Call of Duty. I tried every trigger setting and even maxed out the dead zone settings in the game. Nothing worked right. I have not had this problem on any controller made in the last 20 years, from PS5, Xbox, and or Nintendo.  I have pretty average hands so not sure why that is an issue.Pros: This controller is super responsive, and the sticks are perfect. Fitting Kontrol freaks for xbox is a bonus here. The trigger stops are my favorite in any controller.As a fighter controller this is second to none with the 6 button layout option.If I could just eliminate the accidental trigger presses this would have gotten a 5.
