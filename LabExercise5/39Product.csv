    The controller is great, it feels great and it is easy to connect to the pc. However I wish there was a gap in the controller where you can store the usb dongle like how some wireless mouses do.

    Welcome to the world of gaming, where this controller is determined to be the underdog with a heart of gold – or maybe just gold spray paint. Sure, it has decent range, but in terms of build quality, it's the equivalent of a celebrity chef serving you instant ramen. It's like the Xbox 360 controller's long-lost sibling who got a quick makeover with some modern-age mascara.Feeling cheap? Check. It's so budget-friendly that it probably pays rent to your wallet. But hey, it's not all bad – it's like holding nostalgia in your hands, only if nostalgia came with a receipt. The 2.5GHz connection is here to assure you that it won't bail on you mid-game, unlike that flaky friend who always conveniently loses connection during a crucial match.And let's talk about the dongle – a word that's just as fun to say as it is to own. With a 2.5GHz connection, this dongle is less of a hassle than untangling earphones. It's the unsung hero of the gaming world, silently doing its job without stealing the spotlight.In conclusion, if you're on a budget and want a controller that screams, ""I'm here for a good time, not a long time,"" this might be your joystick soulmate. It's the rebel of the gaming world, wearing its cheapness like a badge of honor – or maybe just a sticker from the dollar store. Game on, thrifty gamers! 🎮💸

    Love the MSI controller, best one I've used so far.PROs:It works right out of the box. no setup or fighting with any hidden settings or connections to get it to work.It stays connected during useIt even has a power save mode that will shut it off after not being used for a while which made me panic the first time as my last controller was a nightmare to get reconnected.The USB dongle that it comes with makes it so much easier to use and reconnecting is an absolute dream.Just push the center dragon logo button and boom, it wakes up and instantly reconnects.CONs:This one is very minor, sometimes one of the buttons makes a slight squeak sound from my finger sliding across the super smooth button surface.Seriously that is my only complaint so far.I've used it for Phasmophobia, Mortal Kombat 11, Hollow Cocoon, over the past week or so since I got it and it is fantastic.  It is so nice to have a wireless controller that actually connects and has a decent range (I've not found a limit to it yet, I can play at a comfortable relaxed distance from my desk.Final thoughts, I love it, and highly recommend this MSI controller.I think some complaints were about needing the USB dongle and needing to carry two things with you if you bring it somewhere with you, but honestly having it makes this such a better controller to use.  A serious improvement to quality of life in my opinion.

    I don't always read 100% of the description on an item before I buy, but this one surprised me in one way that I'll get to in the positives.Overall, very good feeling controller. It has a slightly rough matte finish for a decent grip, and even better, it has lines in the triggers and bumpers to catch your fingers. They definitely feel inexpensive, but they work well to catch your grip, which is great.The controller is rechargeable, which its companion, a first-party X-Box controller, is not. This is mostly good with a little bit of bad, because there's no battery bay to open up and replace, and even if there were, it would be a proprietary Li-Ion that would be impossible to find in 5-10 years anyway. For the price, definitely worth it!It mostly feels solid like a real X-Box controller, and even has rubber grips on the sides, which the name-brand sure doesn't! The buttons are all in the right place and the shoulders are nice and clicky, while the triggers resist just enough to feel like you can slowly pull them back.That's all for naught compared to the coolest feature of this controller: Hot-swappable digital pad! The analog sticks are perfectly fine, but the D-pad is a dream. You can swap out the standard plus-sign with a ""pro controller"" type multi-directional disk easily due to it being magnetic. You heard me, it clicks on with MAGNETS (how do they work?). Both options are actually quite weighty as they're made of metal, not plastic.Now, there are some minor issues, like the non-replaceable battery situation, as well as the fact that it requires a dongle (heh, ""dongle"") to operate with your PC rather than just a built-in Bluetooth, but that's pretty minor so far. That said, they shouldn't discourage you from grabbing this well-built controller that easily competes with its first-party version!

    Decent controller. Seems well built. Not too heavy or light. So far it's responsive and relatively accurate.....but.....NOT USB-C which makes no sense being 2023, NO storage for the dongle so therefore cumbersome to travel with and the battery is NOT removable/replaceable so more plastic in the landfills once it stops charging. Probably should have bought a Microsoft controller but I am a MSI fan and wanted to give it a try. Lesson learned.

    The controller works well.  Have no real problems except for the D-pad.  It is TERRIBLE!  I play a lot of tactical rpgs so they're on a grid and it's easier to navigate them with a D-pad vs the analog stick but the D-pad on this is just so bad.  It has an interchangeable pad thing you can put on...the standard D-pad and a sort of analog-ish pad.  So instead of pushing down on the pad, you just push it in the direction like an analog stick which I guess explains why the regular D-pad is so bad. So that's my main complaint with this controller.

    Just what I needed for my pc games. Would be better if it had more of a PlayStation design, but that’s just my personal preference. I am, however, pleased it’s a brand match for my laptop.

    This has been a pretty decent 7th gen controller for casual PC gaming with a good all day battery. It's what I wish the Xbox 360 controller was like. Quality could be better but I wasn't exactly expecting premo quality for the price. The buttons & sticks could have been better. My A button came a bit loose(still works just rattles allot) also stick response can lag a bit at times on certain games like No Mans Sky & trigger & bumper buttons feel a bit sticky & bumper buttons make a loud clicky noise when pressed. I also wish the charger port was USB C instead of USB Micro but it is basically a 7th gen controller so I wasn't really expecting it to have USB C.

    I could go pro with this were I not a middle aged dude with the reflexes of an anesthetized tree sloth. I mean, the controller is great, I can't detect any difference in responsiveness between this and a wired controller. It uses a receiver, so no Bluetooth hassles... I would definitely buy again.

    Product works great. The only issue is the buttons and joysticks are very sensitive, occasionally puts in extra inputs without a definitive press. If you’re looking for a more sensitive smooth button press, then great. For me, I want a more crisp press and feedback of my inputs.

    The seller claims the device has Bluetooth connectivity. It does not. Not cool. I specifically was looking for an MSI Game Controller that uses Bluetooth like this seller claimed this device uses.I have limited USB ports to use with this wireless gaming controller USB dongle. And some OS platforms might have driver problems. Also, the USB dongle is just one more small piece of hardware to lose.The gaming controller does work on Windows 11 and the materials and engineering are good. It's just not the Bluetooth connectivity device the seller claims it is. Not cool.

    I’ve only had this controller for a short time, but it worked perfectly fine for a bit.Then, all of a sudden during A Call Of Duty Zombies game I could no longer run.I thought this would be it for me as the brand itself obviously has a great reputation.Just not for controllers.

    Apart from its micro-USB connector (really, still?), this has all the makings of an outstanding value controller. The stick accuracy exceeds much more expensive units, which is particularly useful in the racing games I play (FH5, NFS, etc.). I really like this controller and would not hesitate to give it five stars if not for the following issues.My unit frequently gets stuck on vibration--rumbling when there's nothing to rumble, even in the pause menu. I had to reset the controller several times a session. Then, the rumble almost completely died and became little more than a distracting rattle. More than an immersion enhancement, vibration is necessary for a good racing experience, as it provides feedback on tire grip and shift times. The rumble has since returned for now, but it still gets stuck a half-dozen times a session, at least.I figured I just got unlucky and wanted to exchange the controller for a new one. While the issue occurred within the first two months of ownership, I was past my Amazon return window. So, when the rumble died, I went to MSI for an RMA. However, I refuse to pay to ship an RMA. Faulty products not caused by the customer should be the company's responsibility entirely. MSI's representatives clearly cared very little about my issue. As such, the whole experience left a bad taste. If MSI had agreed to provide a shipping label, this very well could be a five-star review.Should you try it? Maybe. The controller is otherwise an excellent product, and you may have better luck than me. But I just can't in good conscience give this a positive rating based on my personal experience.

    So out of the handful of xbox/pc controllers I have, this is by far my favorite. So the only issue I have with this is that with any sudden drops and the d-pad falls off. Maybe they should have used a different type of magnet or mechanism for the swappable d-pads. Works with almost every game I have, and can be temporarily remapped with 3rd party software. Great battery life and leds are not crazy bright and distracting.

    Un producto que cumple con lo prometido, sin problemas y lo detecta el Sistema Operativo sin mayores complicaciones. Funciona de maravilla y te da muchas horas de juego. Puedes pasar semanas sin cargarlo si solamente juegas casual una o dos horas al día. Al tener un diseño basado en el control de xbox 360 la ergonomía no es la mejor, pero sin llegar a ser una tortura o algo incómodo. Simplemente un control de xbox one es mucho mas ergonómico. Le doy 4 estrellas solo por el tema de la ergonomía, pero sin duda es una excelente  compra de la cual no se arrepentirán.

    A bit of false advertising, as far as I can tell the controller does not connect via bluetooth but with a USB dongle. Also my computer screen will not sleep while the dongle is plugged in. This is a known issue you can find on several message boards. Other than that, the controller works well and feels good in hand.

    My gaming laptop was ruined when my upstairs neighbor flooded his apartment and it just happened to come streaming down on my laptop... Anyways, all I have to work with now is my Google Pixel Slate, which runs Chrome OS and only has 2 type C USB ports. I bought a multi adapter dongle for type C which includes 3x USB 3.0, 1x Type C, and 1x HDMI. The controller works flawlessly via the wireless dongle attached to my adapter. FYI, Chrome OS is the worst when it comes to controllers and you HAVE to have a wireless connection, any wired connection and the mapping will be completely incorrect.I am a 100 percent cloud gamer... I use Nvidia GeForce Now and Boosteroid. This controller works GREAT with both applications, and no input lag or latency.The interchangeable Dpad is a great feature and it utilizes a very strong magnet. I haven't had any issue with either of the Dpads.I'm used to using an Xbox controller, and in comparison the MSI controller feels a bit small and took a little bit of getting used to. I also think it feels a bit slippery even though it has a grippy surface on the back. The analog sticks are very firm with no play whatsoever, but I feel like the sticks themselves are a bit skinny and don't have that dense feel like in an xbox controller. The triggers are textured and extremely responsive... no complaints with the triggers.

    The controller itself is fantastic. I love the look, the way it feels, the way it controls, etc., and especially the price for full wireless capability.As some have mentioned the USB ""dongle"" or wireless stick is a bit larger than one would expect, but I haven't had any issues with it.The two main flaws I've noticed are:- The USB dongle doesn't have anywhere to be stored in the controller itself. If you plan to use this as a ""portable"" controller, and not leave the USB plugged in all the time, this might be a big deal for you. It'd be nice to have a place to store the USB in the controller itself when it's not plugged in so it doesn't get lost.- The USB charging uses an older, outdated USB-micro cord and port. It is not the universal, standardized USB-C. All my currently chargeable devices use the same USB-C cord and port, and I only need a USB-micro cord for this controller.The above two things added together make this controller mildly inconvenient to own, and feel like they could be resolved in future designs.
