    This remote is really good! My old remote was gross and sticky from stuff being spilled on it, and I got these as a replacement and they work perfectly! We didn't have to sync them to the TV or anything, they worked right away and the Netflix, YouTube, etc. buttons also work! No voice activation which sucks, but it's definitely a good and cheap replacement if you're needing a new remote for your Roku TV :)

    Literally just put batteries in it, pointed it at the TV and turned it on, volume works, everything, no programming or trial and error. Just perfect.

    I would prefer not to explain how it happened but I dropped the remote in the toilet. Sadly, not a clean bowl. Still, I tried to salvage it but it had to be washed. It did not work after that. I got these remotes the next day. They work. Happy about that

    I have a bunch of pugs, and the one named Ted keeps eating my remotes.  I try to remember to put them away but sometimes I forget; Ted never forgets.  Luckily these are priced to where I don’t have to throw Ted into the woods.

    It does what it says! I got it to replace the remote for my TCL Roku tv and it works great. Just put the batteries in and go. Easy peasey. I love it when things work the way you expect!

    These remotes are amazing and work great right out of the packaging. The reason it got 4 stars is because there are no instructions that say remotes do not need to be programmed, just add batteries and use. They come with a QR you need to scan but it only works with downloading a third party app, once downloaded and scanned it just gives you the capabilities on how to use a remote, so dumb. But these are ready to go right out of the packaging. Two remotes for this price is not bad.

    My parents have a Roku TV and their remote had to be held in a very specific way to change the channel/volume- very annoying. They weren't sure if it was the remote or the TV- so we tried a remote replacement first. The remote was easy to pair and it works extremely well now! such a difference and improvement.I don't like that it came in a 2 pack- they dont need a second one, but thats not really anything to knock it for.

    Our 1 y.o. broke the floppy part that kept the battery cover closed on our original remote, going between a lot of “official” roku remote replacements, I’m glad to have settled on these. They’re compatible with our TCL, Roku tv, and another brand I can’t place at the moment.The first package I got came opened with only one remote like one was taken. Sent a request for replacements and they sent another 2 pack super quick, and arrived very quick as well.Overall, EXCELLENT roku remote replacement.

    We had a broken remote for years. I think it was dropped. We had to be close to the TV, aim a little high-right to hit the sensor, try the volume buttons multiple times to see any change. It was silly.This remote worked out of the box. From across the room. Each button click worked. Seriously, why did we not replace the crummy remote sooner?!! And this came with two! (though I forget where I put the other one)

    Better than all the Rest! I love everything about this remote! I don't mind that it doesn't have prime...1 extra step. It's well made solid, not loose with cover or buttons, no holding it at angles, I think it works though anything in front of the tv. I suffered through other remotes and thought they all were funky! HaHa, I got two for the price of one!

    Okay first off, the remotes do not contain batteries you will need AAA. Next, I was in a rush to buy these and did not read the description which clearly states they were ONLY for smart TVs. Not the sticks/other attachments. Lastly these do work amazingly with a smart tv I have one luckily or I would’ve needed to return these. They were meant to replace my remotes I lost when moving but for now it only replaced one. So hopefully I find the real Roku remotes for my attachment. Anyway if you are looking for a new smart tv remote I think these are a great idea. They are very responsive and you don’t need to connect them in anyway. It’s an automatic connection. It can be used on any smart tv listed in the description from what I assume. I have a onn Roku tv that I used mine on and it worked great. If you are getting this for some type of attachment it will not work (I tried just in case but it needs physically paired, the correct remote should have a pairing button under the battery cover). I hope this review helps.

    I always thought my TV was just a bit slow. Always half a second of delay everytime I used the remote.Well it turns out that's not the case. These remotes are faster than the remote that came with my TCL and feel pretty much the same. Can't really beat that for the price.

    I made sure it was compatible with my tv prior to purchasing. Look at your tv first to mk sure cus we have a ruko tv and  Ruko devices. These remotes aren’t compatible with our devices but compatible with the tv which is what we wanted.I’d buy them again

    We needed a new remote asap. This one was exactly what we were looking for. Bonus of two for the price of one and an extra bonus, it was delivered right to our front door the same day as we ordered it. I don't know how they did it but we are impressed and happy.

    I must say I am happy with this purchase. They immediately worked with my roku Tvs. Thanks so much.. Hopefully I won't need to purchase again and my kids stop losing my remotes, but if they do, this is where I will buy my replacements from.

    These off brand remotes work the same if not better than the original. For the price it’s a must. Just make sure you have triple A batteries as they don’t come with.

    These saved our butts as parents. My daughter is constantly loosing her remotes. Even the link room ones as often as her bed room.  We ordered this 2 pack after hers had been missing weeks at that point.  Both remotes worked perfect after putting battery in them.  I had to do no programming or anything. She has a Roku smart tv.  And the best part was they are exact same as the one that came with it so her glow in the dark silicone remote cases  fit right on no problem.  Oh and soon as they arrived to my home she found her lost one! So we got 3 now for her tv, 1 hidden in my bedroom!

    Worked well right out the box!!  Just need to the purchase batteries! Honestly was a steal only 10$ for two remotes when the name brand one is more expensive for one. Having an extra one works out for my favor, since my dog chewed my remote up in the first place.

    These remotes work better than the ones that came with the TV’s!! For setup you just put batteries in them and point at the tv as simple as that. I turned around and pointed it in the opposite direction as my tv and it still worked, before I would have to make sure it(remote that came with tv) was pointed directly at the tv. Stop looking around and just buy these! I’ll update review if they stop working

    I came home from a long trip, and my TCL remote control was no longer working. I assumed the batteries had died, but even replacement batteries couldn't get it working.Roku wanted $20 for 1 remote, which works out to about 4x the price of one of these badboys. They also no longer sell remotes without a built-in microphone. Hey Roku, I don't need a microphone on my remote control. I already have enough gadgets spying on me. I just wanted a cheap replacement that works.This worked perfectly right out of the box. A surprising bonus was a new key on this remote control, which is a shortcut to setting a sleep timer. I also use 3/4 of the channel shortcut keys, so that worked out better than my old remote as well.Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase.

    I have an older TV with the  remote getting a little weak on sending. This is better than the original; It has a wider field of view and an easier press on the button. It seems much stronger than the last 3 or 4 I have ordered over the years. If it holds up I will be very happy. It also has an extra dedicated button for the sleep timer which will come in handy for me.

    So, my dog literally ate a remote for one tv, and the remote for the other was missing the power button thanks to a teething toddler. I saw the listing for a pair of Roku remotes for about $10 with good ratings and decided to take a chance. So far, I am glad I did. All I did was put a AAA in each remote and they worked with both my tv's instantly with no programming necessary.  I have a Best Buy house brand tv and a TCL and the remotes both work without fuss. There are a few buttons I have not yet tried, but I assume that since the power, volume, and back buttons are working the others likely due as well.
