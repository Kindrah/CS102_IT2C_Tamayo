    The device itself is nicely constructed, seems like a durable metal housing. I like how it has individual buttons to switch directly to PC 1 2 3. I didn't use the mouse/keyboard USB ports because the display it's connected to has a powered USB hub. No issues with the KVM switching the hub between computers, it just works.I needed displayport video out, so I'm using a USB-powered HDMI to DP adapter, which works perfectly with the KVM. No noticeable video latency, and output is stable for 4K at 60 fps.The USB-C port works great, both charging a laptop and doing KVM.I thought the headphone jack might output audio from HDMI, but it and the microphone are actually on a separate USB sound card that gets switched.

    So i bought the iDock B30 I know how they lump these reviewes together but i am only reviewing iDock B30.Personally i didint care about the cost I needed the function it provides as i work from home from several machines. The function it provides faaaar at weighs the cost.If you are reading this chances are you just want to know does it work and are there any issues. So Yes it works great and yes i found a few issues so far. Obvioulsy no reason to list anything about how well it works you are only interested in the bad.1) On the front of the device they have 2 USB connection that are labeled with visual indicators that 1 is a keyboard input and the other a mouse input. Well for some reason the keyboard input will not recognize my keyboards... they light up but the keyboard taps dont make it to the screen. If i plug the keyboard into the mouse port than it works fine. I have tried with 3 different keyboards and same issue. However the work around is to simply plug the keyboard into the mouse USB port and the mouse into the keyboard USB port. Not a deal breaker by any means.2) If I am working on my desktop and my laptop goes to sleep due to power management policy it causes my keyboard and mouse to disconnect on my desktop even though i am not using that device(laptop). It causes my desktop to beep as if a device was plugged in and i lose mouse and keyboard for 1-2 seconds.Other than that i am happy with my purchase but its only been a little over a week.

    A KVM is a must have item for the home office worker. I don't know why I didn't bother with this for years. It wasn't until my wife complained about only being able to use one of her monitors in a dual ultrawide screen monitor setup that I decided to buy one for her (also an AV Access). She used one monitor for work and one for her home PC, but she missed having dual ultrawide monitors. So I installed a KVM for her.That leads me to this KVM. My wife's setup has her work laptop dock in the mix. That's an extra piece of equipment that I wanted to avoid, so I started researching a KVM + docking station with a USB-C PD port compatible with my work laptop and my desktop. Sure enough AV Access has exactly that! For a little more than the cost of the factory docking station, I could have an integrated KVM. Why didn't I do that before?!

    I bought this to test out relative to the TESmart USB 3.0 HDMI KVM Switch which I also bought, this one's definitely better on a few fronts:1) No issues with mouse lagging. The key reason why I wanted to try this was that I was having issues with mouse input lag on the TESmart when using the Logitech mouse that can switch between 3 devices on plug in mode. There's no issues on this one and I can plug in on the front versus the bag in case I need to swap mouse for whatever reason.2) Automatic audio switch. If I'm playing music on my laptop and outputting it via this hub/KVM, it'll automatically switch back to my laptop if I change between the 3 inputs. This does NOT happen on the TESmart which is very annoying since I just get my music cutoff and I'd have to switch to laptop output manually.3) Docking station support. There's no other KVM that's got both USB C docking support AND KVM switch like this. I can cut down on some wires for a less cluttered work area.

    I bought this to replace what appears to be a discontinued USB C switching solution from Synaptics. What I care the most about is being able to easily switch between three computers for a single monitor, keyboard and mouse.One of the USB 1.1 ports on the switch seems to be broken, so it won’t reliably switch when I switch inputs, which is a pain, but I was able to manage since there are also a pair of USB 3.0 ports.The sound output seemed to be completely broken (and the jack is annoyingly on the front of the device which is ok for headphones but not so great for speakers). When I plugged speakers in, there was a loud static sound and no system sound.The name is misleading in that it only has a SINGLE USB C input. The other two inputs are USB 3.0 (USB A) plus HDMI which means that connecting two MacBooks requires one of them to use a dongle (although I have a few USB-C to USB-A+HDMI dongles lying around so I can live with it).On the plus side, it was cheap and doesn’t require special drivers to be used. I should probably exchange it because of the broken USB 1.1 port (and probably broken audio port), but it works well enough that I’ll live with it broken rather than live without while it’s being replaced.

    UPDATE: They sent me a replacement that is working perfectly.After one month of use the KVM switch started causing my monitor to flash blue whenever my PC was plugged in through the KVM switch. This was immediately resolved by plugging directly into my monitor and discontinuing use of this KVM switch.

    I've been searching for solutions for a 3 computer setup, that supported 4K and supported shared devices. The iDock B30 was that solution. I needed a KVM switch that connected a personal desktop PC, a Mac Pro, and a Macbook Pro. It's been great at handling media rich applications and 4K gaming; haven't had any issues whatsoever with it. Switching between computers is straight forward and fairly smooth.

    My old work from home setup involved 2 PCs and three monitor, a keyboard and mouse which I had to change channels on independently to switch between the two PCs, a remote control to change monitor inputs (I'm using a 4K OLED TV as a shared monitor) and HDMI dongles so that Windows doesn't realize the monitor has been disconnected when I switch inputs on the TV (thus, moving around all my windows over to one monitor).  I just discovered this KVM switch and it replaces ALL of that mess and makes it MUCH quicker to change peripherals and OLED from one PC to the other and Windows doesn't mess up my apps.  I wish I had found out about this device back when Covid sent us all to work from home, but better late than never.

    I needed this to setup a two computer, two monitor setup and reduce the back and forth between the two.The KVM works just like it should and give me the ability to switch between computers while using the same peripherals. The ability to also share the monitors gives me flexibility on any headless units I need to hook up to monitors.I wish the refresh rate on 4K was better that 60 but for the price it makes sense why it isnt.All in all it does what it is designed to do with very little footprint.

    So far, this has been a solid KVM. I use it to switch between my home and work PC and it has given me no problems - it just works. The only change I would make is to move most of the USB ports to the back, maybe leave one on the front, to make the cables cleaner.

    Took my time to unplug my existing setup to plug it into this KVM, it does not work, the keyboard and LAN port was the only thing that actually had a light indicating it worked, tried plugging the mouse in multiple ports and it does even light up, for over $200 this does not give confidence at the longevity of this device as this slipped by Quality Control.  Amazon is providing a replacement so I will see how it goes.

    (Update: I've been using this for less than a week, and the keyboard USB port briefly stopped working. My work laptop went to sleep (connected via USB-C). When I woke it back up, the keyboard slot stopped working. The solution seemed to be turning the KVM switch off and then back on. It's a minor annoyance, but I wouldn't have expected that from a $200+ KVM switch.)I've used a few different KVM switches, and they can be rather finicky. This one is plug-and-play with no problems. This can be used to switch between 3 computers, assuming 1 of them is a laptop that connects via USB-C. This ends up being the biggest benefit that I've seen with this KVM. It functions as a laptop dock, which is extremely convenient. This has streamlined my work from home setup substantially. I have my personal desktop connected to the switch and outputting to my dual-monitor setup. My work laptop connects to the KVM via a single USB-C cable (included). The laptop is even powered by the dock.The KVM switch is rather large. It's about half the size of my 15-inch work laptop. I'm not crazy about this, but perhaps it's to be expected given the amount of functionality packed into this thing. One nice thing about the size is that it's big enough that it isn't pulled by the numerous cables that are plugged into the back of it, which was a minor annoyance with the other switches that I've used.The USB data cable that connects the switch to the desktop seems to be proprietary (looks like a modified USB-B connector), which could be a problem if you're hard on your cables. The provided cables seem sturdy enough, but I'm not confident that I could get a new one. The HDMI cables that it comes with aren't super long, so keep that in mind for your particular setup.The only other qualm that I have with this is that it's really expensive. I would only justify the price of this thing if you really need the specific functionality of having a dual-monitor KVM with a laptop dock built in (or if you can just get your work to pay for it 😂).Overall this is really nice and easy to use. As always, I'll update my review if anything changes in the coming months.

    This was very well packed and came with almost everything you'd need to get started with one input / output.  You *will* need more cabling if you plan on having multiple displays and also multiple sets of input. This is standard practice and completely normal.The USB-C output charged my HP Elite Notebook with no issues at all. I had some trouble with the USB-C input connected to this same device, but only after I removed all the cabling / setup to rearrange what input plugged into which switch port. This was working originally. I ended up swapping the USB-C to another windows 11 PC, which worked fine.I was have a USB Mouse and Keyboard which have selectors for three different pairing devices, which ended up working perfectly with this KVM.Ended up using a wired USB keyboard on the front panel to do initial setup until I could get all my devices working on paired Bluetooth. Worth keeping around a wired option!The instructions are adequate to work through this setup. As soon as I get a second display for my output, I plan on testing out the remaining ports for dual display.As others have indicated, given how many input / outputs this device is capable of servicing, cable management can be tricky. I'm old though and remember having to run KVM's with VGA and DVI, so this is a welcome addition to my desktop!As a side note, the sellers reached out to me prior to shipping the product to give me the rundown on how to support 2 x 4K displays at a reasonable refresh rate. Great customer welcoming service!

    Functionally, this works as you want it to. Switches between computers well, no issues with lag, etc. It's also a solid unit - doesn't feel cheap. Where it loses a star is a couple places - no USB-C, and the USB ports are in the front. USB-C is the new standard, so it hurts this doesn't have it. Unless you expect to hot-swap some thumb drives into your KVM, there's no reason to have the USB ports in the front. That said, if you're planning to mount this under your desk or out of sight, then is probably doesn't matter and you're good.

    This is one of the best KVM that I've used.  It has lots of configurations and options and it has pretty good switching speeds.  It can reach high  Hz which means you can get more frames on either device.  This is great to use on non-computers like phones or tablets.Things I love:Easy to setupSturdy ConstructionWorks for more than gamingThings I loved less:Price kinda highIf you are a gamer, you should buy this, there are not many different devices that have the same specs here and if you got here how I got here, then you know that this is defiantly worth grabbing.I recommend this KVM.

    I got this so I could use one monitor for my desktop gaming rig and XBox, and then have my work laptop charging and open on another screen.  It works perfectly for this.  I can play my console or my PC games with the click of a switch, while keeping my laptop charged and immediately see if anything happens when I'm on call.  There's no loss of clarity with the monitors - they work just as well as they did when I had them set up separately.  But this way it's one unified system - it makes it fun to look at game forums or Twitch while I'm playing on the other screen.  No windows on the screen or having to switch tabs - it's all done through the set-up.The instructions are very easy to follow, and suggest several different ways you can set it up.  I knew how I wanted it, but it's interesting to know that there are several other options.  If something happens and I have to start working from home I'm totally ready!I do think this is kind of expensive, but it works flawlessly and saved me the trouble of switching cords on my main monitor (it's a 40"" ultrawide) from the computer to the console.  It runs at 144hz and this switch handles it like it's not even there.  Plus there will never be any wear or issues with plugging and unplugging them all the time.  That doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but computers and monitors are not really designed for that. For that matter, neither are laptops...  I think given all this it's a pretty good value for the price.

    So, this KVM switch, huh? It's decent, with some quirks.The good stuff: It's sturdy, and video quality is solid. The USB 3.0 cables included are a plus. Hotkeys and front buttons work fine, and it fits neatly on my equipment rack.The not-so-good: Switching is a bit slower than my old one, and the audio has its quirks. The audio pops during boot-up, and there's an audio balance issue. The modifier key for switching inputs is too easily changed.Overall, it does the job, but there's room for improvement.

    We have one room that has multiple television, computer and video game setups. We didn't have too many issues until we brought in a pair of augmented reality glasses. We wanted to make a wireless connection from the switch to a receiver close to the seating area. We used our existing HDMI transmitter/receiver. This switch worked with no problems.We'd tried this setup with another switch, and we had volume issues. The KVM switch worked perfectly. We can shoot the signal from our PS5 to the receiver, and it is routed to the gaming monitor as well. This switch has features beyond our needs, but it can still be setup by an amateur with minimal tech knowledge. The construction is very good quality. Nothing on this unit feels cheap. Recommended.

    In regard to a KVM this works perfectly and now I don’t have to switch inputs on my monitor and drag out a second keyboard and mouse to switch between my Mac and my PC.The build quality is excellent and is all metal I also like how the power plug barrel can be screwed in.The included USB 3.0 cables included a substantial and nice and long as is the power cable.A few things to consider when looking at this.1.) There is no USB-C support on this KVM2.) There is no HDMI cable in the box so you will need to have at least one on hand.3.) The USB inputs are on the front of the KVM so if you like a clean look like me you might get annoyed by this.I really wish this had two USB ports on the backside to keep things cleaner but at least with them on the front you get a good mix of ports.

    I got this for my husband to streamline his computer and gaming set up. Not being an AV expert, he found it very easy to set up. He was able to use the include USB type A to Type B cables to connect his computers to the KVM switch, and hook up the two monitors using HDMI cables (not included). The added ports on the front are very convenient for sharing your keyboard, mouse, and any other device you may wish to use such as a headset or camera. The instructions were simple and easy to follow and the images are clear.

    Good variety of ports, however no USB-C or DP. USB ports are also exclusively on the front of KVM. Easy to hook up to computers and worked flawlessly out of box. Super fast and simple set-up even for those not super familiar with tech. Makes things easier only needing one set of peripherals for your setup that you can readily switch between devices. I am using mine standalone with my computer and connecting my laptop when needed and switching all inputs to control laptop without having to find space to connect and use everything with laptop without having to take out another set of peripherals.

    This is a fantastic product that works flawlessly for PC gamers and workers.  If you have two monitors and want to be able to switch between the two monitors easily and flawlessly then this is for you!The specs are great. The ease of setup and use is great! I love being able to use one keyboard and mouse for both screens now or not having to swap one keyboard and mouse between two monitors.Overall this is a great value and worth every penny.This would make a great gift.  Highly recommend.

    The switcher works great! All inputs are on the front or the switcher. The power plug has a screw on cable so it can’t be pulled out accidentally. It’s made of a heavy duty metal casing. The box is about 9.25 x 6 inches.  The switcher uses USB 3.0. It’s important to know that with this set you will need 4 more HDMI cables if you already have one cable for each computer. You need 6 cables in all.  No cables come in this version of the switcher. Amazon does sell another more expensive version which includes cables. It’s easy to connect the switcher and the clarity is very good.

    The KVM switch was very easy to setup and use. I can switch between computer using the switch on the KVM or using the keyboard. The keyboard needs to be plugged in to the 1.1 USB port. It also has 3 3.0 USB ports that are shared between the 2 computers. I am using a wireless mouse and keyboard as the KVM is not on my desktop but with keyboard shortcut I have no problem switching between computers. Also I have USB thumb drive in on of the other USB ports. I can copy file to the drive and switch to other computer and access to the files on the thumb drive. This is really going to cut down on the mass of wires. You can also share microphone and speakers. The KVM also switches between the computers in a couple seconds. By using the KVM I reduced the number of monitors from 4 to 2. This will cut down on not only the power needed for the 4 monitors but also the amount heat 4 monitors generate. This is definitely a welcomed accessory to my desktop.

    This KVM switch for AV Access lacks the USB-C and DP video inputs and the LAN connection of my fancier home KVM switch from AV Access which allows a laptop to share displays and peripherals with a desktop, but it allows two desktop computers to share screens and peripherals. Both computers need two HDMI outputs to fully utilize this switch's abilities. Shares peripherals easily: HDD, scanner, audio, keyboards and mice. Allows both hotkey and front button switching while keeping computers awake. A great way to share displays and peripherals between a work and a gaming computer.

    Overall, the AV Access HDMI KVM USB Extender is a good option for extending a computer's HDMI and USB signals over a long distance. It is easy to set up and use, and it supports all major operating systems. However, the maximum resolution is 1080P, and the USB ports are 2.0, so it may not be suitable for all applications.

    There are an endless variety of KVM switches on the market but the serve the same basic function:  they allow you to operate multiple computers using the same peripherals.  The specifics vary widely, but this is what they're for.  And that's what I use this for--I occasionally have to switch between my desktop or laptop running Ubuntu and a production PC running Windows.  The last thing I want to do is to have to waste time plugging and unplugging everything when I need to switch.  This device makes it extremely simple and fast.  I only need one monitor for this use so the display functionality isn't important to me.  If it is, you might want to find a more powerful switch that can handle it.  For most general uses this one does a great job.  Highly recommended!

    With this switch you can control 2 computers or laptops  while using one mouse or keyboard. Sounds trivial but having 2 sets of mouse and keyboard takes up desk real estate and is clumsy. I frequently use 2 monitors and since my work system is one one browser but I prefer another for personal use, I can have both pc's running with one keyboard to control. Or bring home the work laptop (if you use one) and hook it in while using another desktop.Very helpful for those who bring in laptops for helping others...and more applications.

    This KVM switch is certainly a bit on the pricey end of the spectrum, but it does feel worth it. The attractive profile looks ok remaining on my desk, giving me access to essentially hub ports I can use with both of my workstations. The build quality is top-notch and I love having the ability to switch inputs with hot keys. It introduces absolutely no detectable lag on input or video. If you’re ok with the price, this is an excellent KVM.

As someone constantly switching between a gaming PC and laptop for work, having an effortless KVM switch to transition between them is a must. This dual monitor switch has made controlling both systems completely seamless, allowing me to use a 2K display for gaming and work. The included cables made set up easy since all I did was just plug in both PCs into the switch box via USB and HDMI and connected my monitors. Now I can swap between computers instantly with the push of a button or hotkey. For anyone running a multi-PC setup, this switch is indispensable. It allows me to easily share peripherals and displays across separate systems without any sacrifice in speed or performance. Seamless computer-swapping is a productivity game-changer!

    This KVM switch performs very well. It supports two input computers and two output monitors. The monitors can be dedicated to each input computer simultaneously, or you can have two monitors for each computer you switch to. Lots of USB ports for additional peripherals. The power adapter screws into the switch which is great - no more accidentally unplugging the switch by bumping it. And you will need this, because there is no remote physical switch to toggle computers - you either have to program a hot key or press a button on the front of the switch. Comes with power adapter and two short USB cables - I wish they were longer!

    Some quick notes before details:- The HDMI switching is fast and reliable- The power adapter is a bit of a hassle and seems like they could have made that more convenient (internal power?)- Support is lacking- I have 3 PCs connected (MinisForum mini PC, mid-size gaming tower, work laptop)Ok, so my main issue is with the USB setup they have. If I have a wired mouse/keyboard, it'd probably be fine and dandy, but I do not. I have a ""unifying receiver"" from Logitech with both an MX keyboard and Mouse connected to it. The USB ports are giving me problems because I don't think they provide enough power to run this bluetooth connection. At least, I get frequent issues with constant mouse connection though this device. Sometimes it seems worse with specific devices, but is never 100%.Why couldn't it drop the USB 1.1/2.0 dedicated ports in favor of more 3.0 ports? Is it a power issue? That would (hopefully) resolve the problem. As it is right now, there aren't enough ports for me to split these two devices to their own receivers to see if that gives me a better time with reception.ANOTHER USB issue is that my work PC complains about ""too many USB hubs"" when trying to connect an additional hub to this KVM switch to add more ports. Which is weird since the KVM switch I am replacing (IOGEAR) didn't have that issue and I was able to connect devices with my USB 3.0 hub. So I wonder about the way this KVM is set up internally.I would exercise caution with purchasing this device and know what potential issues you may be running into. The USB port setup really is the main problem for me, but it's really noticeable and makes this straddle the line between useful and trash.UPDATE:The USB-C port stopped outputting video randomly. I switched cables to be sure, and still nothing. USB still works OK (I was able to connect an HDMI to a different monitor while staying connected to this KVM switch) but video is just dead. So it's a whole 1/3 usability just basically gone now. I haven't used a LOT of KVM switches, but this has been easily the worst so far.

I've been using this switcher for the past month, switching daily, multiple times, between a Linux box and a Win10 box.  It takes about 3 seconds for the switch to complete, but once it does, there is no lag with keystrokes on the keyboard nor with the mouse.  I have all of my USB peripherals (scanner, printer, web cam, etc.) plugged into a USB 3 powered hub and have that powered hub plugged into the switcher, so all of my peripherals switch over as well.  I am also using HDMI cables for connection to my monitor (which is actually a 32"" TV).  You can see in my lousy video how long it takes to switch over.  The switcher allows you to switch by either pressing a front-facing button on the switcher itself, or by using a key combo on the keyboard.  It is set to TAB+1 and TAB+2 by default, but you can customize that (the included instructions walk you through it).  The instructions are actually pretty good overall and easy to follow.  I can highly recommend this switcher.

    A few things to note:There's only 3 usb ports on this. We'll, 3 USB ports plus one dedicated USB port for your keyboard. If you're like me, and have a lot of usb devices, this may be an issue.If you try to reduce the number of usb ports that you need, by using a wireless keyboard/mouse combo that only needs one port, this KVM will NOT work correctly. You won't be able to move the mouse over to the second monitor; you'll be able to see the monitor, and your computer will recognize the display, but your mouse won't go over there. You must use a keyboard and mouse that use separate USB ports.The hot key switching on this only occasionally works. I usually have to push the button on the actual KVM.When I wake up the computers from being asleep, the 2nd monitor doesn't always come up. I have to switch btwn the 2 computers, via the button on the KVM (because the hot key switching rarely works), to get the 2nd monitor to come up.I'm not the least bit impressed with the image quality on my monitors. I have one monitor that is using HDMI input, and one that is using an HDMI to VGA cable, as it's an older monitor (this KIM'S video outputs are HDMI). The monitor using the HDMI to VGA looks ok, but my new monitor using HDMI looks ""washed out."" I've been playing with the display settings for days now and can't get it to look any better. My monitor looks fine if I bypass the KVM.I'm using this KVM with 2 Dell Thunderbolt docks. I have not tried using it without the docks, as I frequently need to unhook my laptops and use them elsewhere, so there's no way I'm not going to use the docks. I have not tested whether any of my issues could be resolved by not using the Thunderbolts.All in all, the KVM does technically do what it's supposed to do, I just can't say that it does it well. I'm honestly  inbetween giving it 3 or 4 stars.
