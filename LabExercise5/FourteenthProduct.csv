    I recently purchased the SENSYNE 62"" Phone Tripod & Selfie Stick, and I love it!!. As a new and upcoming photographer. I was on the lookout for an affordable yet reliable selfie stick that I could take with me anywhere that was not too heavy, and this tripod/selfie stick combo has proven to be an excellent choice. I am very short and could never hold the phone and take pics at the same time. This extendable feature of the tripod allows me to capture shots from various angles and heights, providing versatility to my photography. The 62-inch height is particularly advantageous for group photos or capturing stunning landscapes. The ability to transform it into a selfie stick adds an extra layer of functionality, making it an all-in-one solution for my photography needs. I don't have to stretch to get the perfect picture anymoreOne of the standout features, that I like is the wireless remote, which adds convenience to my photo sessions. Being able to control the shutter remotely ensures that I can be a part of the frame without any hassle. The setup is incredibly user-friendly, making it perfect for someone like me who is just starting in the world of photography. I love the price and the look of this stick. Highly recommend it!Not only is the SENSYNE 62"" Phone Tripod & Selfie Stick cost-effective, but it also delivers on performance. It's an ideal companion for any aspiring photographer, offering a seamless blend of affordability, ease of use, and functionality. I highly recommend this product to fellow beginners or anyone in search of a reliable and budget-friendly tripod/selfie stick solution.

    The 62"" metal tripod collapses to about 18"", easily adjust to any height up to 62"", the phone holder provides a secure spring grip for the phone and can be adjusted to multiple angles/positions to include the ability to photo items on a table. Followed the instructions to activate the remote bluetooth for the camera (comes with the battery on/off switch). The item also comes with a mount for a go-pro camera. I ran a small bead chain (not supplied) on the remote and looped it on the tilt adjust knob for ready access. Very pleased with the quality, unlimited adjustment features, can be used as a selfie stick, easy to follow instructions, a great photo tool to add photos to a photo frame.

    I bought this for my wife for Xmas so we can get her in or family pictures too. That and so I don't have to do those long reach selfies to get everyone in the picture. We took this on a vacation and it worked great. The remote is awesome. The stand is awesome. Worth the money.

    So there are only specific angles you can set to point your phone camera up or down…so if you need just a little more down, you have to go about a quarter of an inch down…you can just lift the extensions up…but the extension heights have a lot of adjustments so you can really get a good height…I use this to video tape my terrible skateboarding skills to improve where I may be doing something wrong…before this I was just leaning my phone against a wall causing damage to my phone…this was a great idea that I can just quickly and effortlessly set this up and start recording.  Phone fits very nicely with just a little bit of room to snap the phone in place…wide legs to make sure it doesn’t tip over.  Very light and compact too…a great addition to my video set.  I would recommend.

    A year after purchase this stand gets used at least once a week and we've had no problems at all with it. The bright color makes it easy for the crew to see when we're doing hectic live sales online. Absolutely would recommend. Very sturdy, easy to use.

    This tripod has good weight and is stable. It has good construction and is easy to use. It is tall enough for most people. I am 6'5"" and with the phone mount, my screen is about neck high, which some may say is too low, but it works well for me. I probably should have gotten the 67"" and my screen would have been face level. My phone is a OnePlus 11, the remote control only zooms in, it did not take pictures. The instructions say the app will help if there's any trouble with the remote, but I haven't tried downloading the app yet. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase!

    Super happy with this product for the price point. Strong enough to hold my phone in all different positions. Doesn’t easily tip, etc. Adjusts to be quite tall, and is super easy to set up/ use. Would recommend!

    My first tripod broke on the base so I decided to order a new one from the same brand. They updated the design which does not allow me to remove the part that may connect a camera. It does its job, but I do not like this change, as I originally used it for both recording and wig styling, so I cannot put the wig head on. But, if you are looking for a sturdy tripod this should do the job as I have spent an hour trying to remove it to realize there is a bar that does not allow the removal of the camera attachment.

    I'm an RV inspector and an constantly recording videos and taking photos of things moving, running, breaking, and catching fire. This tripod is great. It's lightweight, the camera grip is strong but flexible, and the adjustable height mechanism is perfect for a wide range of recording angles. I've been through three tripods in the past year and this one has exceeded the build quality and height for value of all three. I'd buy this again in a heartbeat if it got stolen.

    So I’m writing a review about this part of this is my fault. The other part is product defect I purchased this a while back and I didn’t use it for about a month or so after I purchased it and on my first time using it, it worked great, but when I went to collapse it to put it away in the picture as you could see, the bottom part broke on me. The unfortunate part which is frustrating is that it’s a third-party not from Amazon but Amazon help me out still but the problem was I couldn’t exchange it because I was passed my time on it even though it was my first time using it frustrating but rules are rules but I’m just writing a review about it and that’s all yes I like it. Yes I will probably buy one more of these but I wanted to show what the product did on me the first time using it that’s all.

    I bought this because I’m eloping in Vegas in a month. I am trying to cut costs and all I really wanted was to be able to have footage of our ceremony. I have an iPhone so I was wary of the remote but it works!!! I’m super happy with this and if it ever breaks I will be buying another. This will be a total game changer for family pics, content creators, getting that perfect selfie or portrait angle, and whatever else you may need a tripod for! It feels pretty sturdy but I will update once we get home from our trip. It’ll be at a dry lake bed so I’m expecting it to be windy, we shall see how it holds up.03/04/24

    We really like these tripods! We’ve used them for our family photos, for recording videos and for recording games with friends. The only thing I don’t really like is the “selfie stick” part. I thought that it would come with a separate piece for a handle but you just collapse the tripod stand part and use that as the handle and we’ve pinched our hand a few times trying to use it, but we honestly don’t use that function that often anyway.

    I like the versatility of this product - can be held like a selfie stick, and also extends to make a very-portable tripod.  It's a good compromise if you need something to do both, especially for travel, if you don't need a super-grufty tripod or a super-light selfie stick.  Fits easily into a suitcase and can fit into/onto a backpack.I didn't notice that it comes with a Bluetooth remote, and haven't tried that yet, but it's a nice bonus.Customer service great!  The first unit actually had a looseness problem of the top support, and they quickly sent a replacement that took care of the problem.

    This is a great tripod. I honestly only have one complaint and it’s the lack of motion where you connect your phone. It moves a decent amount, don’t get me wrong. But for what I was purchasing it for, there was no way to get the angle I wanted.So overall, it’s a really decent tripod. But if you want more downward tilt I would consider something else.

    I bought this so that we could take some DIY family photos when our baby was born. It worked amazingly for that! I also use it to take milestone pictures of our baby in front of a sheet as a background. The remote connects via bluetooth and is small enough that you can hold it in your hand while you take photos without seeing the remote. I am very impressed with this purchase!

    It’s decent. It’s a cheap, Chinese made tripod. Don’t expect anything great but it’ll hold your phone which is hopefully all you’re asking it to do. I bought it to snap photos from my phone, which I will probably use the timer as it’s not overly solid like a more expensive tripod. I don’t regret buying this and it’ll serve the purpose I bought it for.

    Very slim easy piece to transport and use. Our phones fit securely, remote does it job, zero complaints. Well, we've misplaced the remote a few times; suggest finding a way to secure to the tripod when packing away. We were going to use for a family reunion, then send back (don't judge you've done something similar I bet) but found it was too handy to sent back. Kids used for Christmas card pictures and we used for a crazy family video thing. Very happy with this buy.
