    Pros:- LONG battery life. From a full charge, logged 9hrs while working from home and had 77% battery the next day. Great for those who may not be using this headset on a daily basis (or those who are and forget about charging daily!).- USB-C charging connectivity (A to C cable supplied, high quality, long length).- Lightspeed dongle is small and discrete.- Comfort: (YMMV... I'm a male in mid 20s with a medium sized head... I think?) after a few days of playing around with the ski band placement and earcup position, I finally found a setup that worked for me. I have stud earrings and found some higher positions of the earcups were originally pressing on my lobes and causing some discomfort. Switching the band to the larger position and bringing the earcups down allowed me to seat everything nicely without any discomfort. Wore the headphones all day while working from home and forgot I wasn't wearing my usual headphones (Beyerdynamic DT770... Which are my top choice for headphone comfort).- Logi GHub connectivity/customizations are decent. Simple volume, mic volume, sidetone (hearing your voice thru mic with no latency), audio EQ customization (with presets and custom settings)- Doesnt look super ""gamer-y""... a good plus if I need video on during a (professional) call.- Flip to mute mic is great. I dont like having to deal with a removable mic or a fixed mic. The hardware based muting of the G535 mic is convenient and easy and doesnt require much finger dexterity... Allows me to mute on Discord or Teams while AFK.- Volume wheel and power button are smartly and intuitively placed and sized. Only a couple times have I accidentally brushed the volume wheel with the hood of my sweatshirt, but this only clicks the volume up a notch or two.Cons:- Noise cancelling is pretty weak. No active noise cancelling (but you wouldnt expect that at this price). Not much isolation from surrounding sounds, but this wasn't a large drawback for me as I play in relatively quiet environments- Mic quality: its a 2.4ghz wireless mic, so you have the usual downsides. Reduced high end, thinner bottom end. Its fine! But clarity suffers a little due to the intrinsic qualities of WIRELESS HEADSET technology. Please note that THIS MIC IS PERFECTLY FINE FOR GAMING, WORK CALLS, AND OTHER GENERAL COMMS PURPOSES!- Sound Quality: its fine! I do audio recording and mixing, so I'm biased when it comes to any set of headphones. My Beyerdynamic DT770 have a very wide soundstage, clear highs, articulated bass, and balanced mid range. I spend maybe 12 hours a day using the DT770s and love them for everything (aside from being wired). The G535 are fine for casual gaming, calls, video watching, and music listening. The default flat EQ is very acceptable, and I only tuned it a small amount to increase the high end, soften some mid range resonances, and add some weight in the low end. The stereo soundstage is a little muddy, but all wireless ""gaming"" headsets that I have tried in the past suffer from this- I would liken it to feeling like you are underwater and the sound is surrounding you equally and internally. Again, these headphones are PERFECTLY FINE for gaming, calls, video, and music. I wouldn't try to mix any audio, analyze new music, or try to take in a renowned movie soundtrack with this headset. Again I'm using my Beyerdynamic DT770s as reference here (the cadillac of headphones in my eyes)- they excel at being wired headphones with articulated qualities for music recording and mixing environments (and theyre great for CSGO with their better isolation qualities).- No bluetooth, but I have a pair of galaxy buds that I use with phone/laptop... And I can always throw the USB lightspeed dongle in my laptop and crack out the G535s!Overall verdict: The G535 are my first forray into wireless gaming headsets, and I am beyond impressed by what it offers (especially for $80 on sale)! It is adaptable to many head shapes and sizes (both youth and adult), has an incredible battery life, delivers good audio and mic quality for wireless headsets (better than cheaper $50 random brands), has great controls (both physical and software) without overwhelming the user or offering too much unnecessary functionality - very plug and play. I would definitely recommend this headset to anyone looking to make a worthwhile purchase without breaking the bank (say, the Gpro wireless).

    I am a pretty serious gamer when it comes to playing Counter strike and i have tried about 6-7 different headsets. Ive always been weary on bluetooth as ive heard they are generally quieter than wired headsets, and my last experience wasnt great with wireless. i saw this one was on sale and decided to try it out. the packaging is solid and no damage at time of delivery. The headset came about 50% charged. The headset paired with the bluetooth dongle immediately with no issues. Now when i initially played CS2 with them they were quieter than id like/expected, but thats when steelseries GG comes into play. After tinkering with Steelseries GG and tuning the audio to my liking, it really made this headset shine. the sound is exactly what i was looking for. I often hear more things than the average player on my team. If you know teamspeak and know the sound of that is very monotone and straight to the point this headset is quite similar. The sound is just very raw and isnt trying to make it sound like a jungle oasis. You hear what you have to hear and thats just pefect for counterstrike. Now this headset is also great for jungle oasis sounds, music sounds beautiful through them and so do videos/movies/shows etc. if you have been thinking about going wireless i really really recommend these... EVEN IF THEY ARENT ON SALE.

    My background: Saying I game a lot is an understatement. I probably spend about 30-40 hours a week on my pc both for work and gaming. In the last 10 years I've tried multiple headsets with different budgets ranging from $30-$150 until I settled with a budget Corsair headset for $40 for years. Over time I was having issues with Corsair and their build quality. The faux leather/vinyl material they used for the headband and ear cushions was absolutely terrible where it would crack and flake within months. This time I went for a change and decided on this Logitech G335.Pros:- 1 cable does it all. Plug and playI liked my previous Corsair headset that had one cable for everything. This one comes with a 3.5mm that connects both audio and mic together. I did try it with a USB adapter on my PC with no issues and also tried on my PS5 through my PS5 controller again with no issues. Installation was pretty much plug and play. I didn't have to download any filler software although I heard Logitech's software is pretty nice.- Lightweight, Headband and Ear cushions are sturdyThe headset feels comfortable and lightweight on my head, I have not experienced any headaches even after long periods of time. One thing that won me over on this headset was the stretchy cloth headband (is removable in case it needs to be washed) fits nice and snug. My last headset was flaking pieces of faux leather into my ears so I really tried looking for a headset with a different material. The headset does have a very plastic cheap feel but it is a $40 headset. I've dropped it a few times and I've seen no damage, so far so good- Good sound quality and micThe sound isn't studio quality but it's pretty good for the price. I don't notice any difference from my old Corsair headset and HyperX ones I've used in the past. My friends on Discord also said I sound a lot clearer in voice calls and slightly quieter but I think the quiet issue is Discord.CONS- No mute button or removable micThis was one of the features that I missed with my old headsets. The way to mute the mic is by flipping it up and you'll hear a small click. I feel like after many uses it may lead to issues down the road if you mute/unmute a lot. I ended up setting up a Discord hotkey to mute instead. The mic also isn't removable which isn't a deal breaker for me but if you plan to use this on the go, just know you'll have that mic hanging around.-No Sidetone?If y'all don't know what Sidetone is, per Headset Advisor Sidetone is a feature where a small amount of your own voice that's piped into your ear speaker as you speak. Any headset with heavy noise cancellation really needs sidetone otherwise you're yelling into your mic because you can't really hear yourself. This headset doesn't have this feature however it's not fully noise cancelling so it's not a big deal for me. I can still somewhat hear myself but it does block a lot of external noises. Lack of sidetone isn't exactly a con for me but can be for others that feel they absolutely need to hear their voice.Overall this is a great headset for the price. Not spectacular but dang good for $40. Most of these budgets headsets tend to give out after a year so i'll update y'all in about a year. Happy gaming!

    i have had numerous headsets over the years and these are the best to date.1 the sound is rich and clear2 the cushions over the ears are cloth, so you dont sweat your ears off. and get that irritation in and around my ears, comfortable!3 it fits my large cranium well4 can be used with the cord while charging or without, have used them all day and not had them drop out because of charge.5 there pretty sturdy, many others have failed on me by breaking at some little pin that holds the ear phone to the head set, these are much more sturdy.6 the ear pads block out all but the loudest household noise7 excellent price point8 this is a big one - THEY SHUT OFF AFTER 30 MIN OF INACTIVITY!! saves battery life!

    First, these headsets are great for those who use PC or Xbox One to game. I'm sure they can be used on anything that has a jack-in port.Side note for Xbox users: Don't get the dongle version of this headset if you have an Xbox One Gen 1. The USB ports don't work with any dongle devices.As long as I've been gaming, I've never invested in headphones. As far as first pairs go, I think it serves its purpose.The volume isn't the greatest, but I can't say if that's because of Xbox One, Discord settings, or the headphones itself. I don't mind that it has 0 noise-canceling features because it's safer that way. I've learned that noise-canceling devices can eliminate your awareness in emergencies (like if a family member needs help, or a fire happens in the house, etc.). While I know that it's unlikely those things will ever happen for some people, I live in a rough neighborhood where it pays to have all your senses present. Honestly, I can hear my friends just fine with them, but the unit doesn't have an eardrum-shattering volume. Probably for the best.I really like the way the set can be adjusted at the ear muff parts and at the head strap. I also appreciate that the mic can be turned off by just flipping the piece up. The way that the ear parts encapsulate my ears is also a nice feature. It's very plush, which is great for my sensitive ears. I can't use ear devices that insert into my ears--it causes massive pain in under 10 minutes, so having a device that never touches my ears, lets me play longer. The head strap is also a nice feature because it prevents the hard plastic portion from sitting on my head. If you've ever had the weight of a headset sit on your head for long periods of time, you know how much it can hurt.

    Used these for about an hour and a half and it's been nothing short of a horrible experience.The product looks great but at this price point, it leaves a LOT to be desired. It feels cheap and flimsy.Sound quality: It feels really tinny and harsh and flat at the same time somehow. The highs are really sharp and loud and the lows are lacking and very flat. I experimented with the presents and the advanced EQ and even after about 20 minutes of messing around the sound was awful. The only upside is that you can set customer profiles for different games but it can't compensate for cheap drivers. A pair of $30 Samsons or Superluxes is 10 times better at sound stage and sound quality overall.Volume: The volume is extremely low which is really strange. I am guessing with the cheap driver it introduces a lot of distortion if the volume is turned up and it's unusable for gaming since you can barely hear anything. The volume knob doesn't have hard stops so as you are using them you keep wanting to turn the volume up but it just provides an obnoxious beeping sound for 1-2 seconds letting you know you are maxed out. If you turned the knob a few times since it doesn't have a hard stop it will beep at you for 5-6 seconds before you can hear anything.The G Hub software tries to do some sort of volume correction as well so when you tab between windows it lowers the volume and slowly brights it back up which is obnoxious.Latency: The latency seems pretty good but during my 1.5 hours of playtime I lost audio twice completely for no reason. I was playing CS2 and it just completely muted itself. I switched inputs and the audio was working fine on my speakers. I had to restart the headset and unplug it to get everything working again.Microphone: I have had better sound quality with a cheap $10 wired microphone. It's crunchy and flat and sounds a bit like a radio.Just as a point of reference, I came from using a pair of SteelSeries Arctis headset from 2017 that are about the same price, and if those are a 7/10 the Logitech G535 is maybe a 2/10 at best.Horrible controls, bad software, bad drivers, mediocre microphone (at least it works I guess). The only good thing is the battery life (I am basing that off of other reviews since I only used it for a short period).At this price, you can do much better. I would maybe pay $25 for something like this to keep in a closet in case of emergency but at a $100+ there are hundreds of better options out there.

    I like the sound quality and the wearing comfort. I can easily forget I have them on. I don't use the mic so I don't know how it sounds to other gamers. I have only had them for a couple of months, so I'm not sure about the durability. They feel durable. I like the positioning of the volume wheel. Easy to find and adjust.

    Comfort? 10/10. Sound quality? 1/10. I bought this because my dog ripped the cable on my Razer V3 X apart after he got his foot caught in the cord and thought it was chasing him. I was originally going to replace it with another V3 X because I liked that headset a lot, but out of curiosity I decided to scroll through all of the other headsets listed on Amazon and saw that this one was only $37 when it's normally $60 and couldn't pass that up. My first headset was an old Logitech g930 given to me by a neighbor and I loved it to death (literally, it disintegrated) so I thought that the same could be true for this one. Unfortunately, I was very wrong, this headset's build quality feels extremely cheap for having a base price of $60; my V3 X cost me $44 and its build quality was eons better than this one! Not to mention you can find it at Walmart for like $30 most of the time. The sound range and quality of this headset felt tinny and cheap as well, all I could hear were base-y, deep sounds and hardly anything else; ESPECIALLY ENEMY PLAYER FOOTSTEPS!! There's no way to adjust the headset digitally either because it doesn't have any software! In comparison, my V3 X is way more dynamic and has always been reliable, not to mention you can adjust it digitally in Razer Synapse. Overall, I can see how this would be a good option for a console gamer, it's cheap and has a 3.5mm to plug into your controller, but if you're a PC gamer like me I don't recommend this at all. Go get a Razer V3 X instead!

    Windows 11 w/ Discordset up painlessly with GHUB.These are sooooo much lighter than similar headsets from Logitech, Corsair, HyperX.  I love the boom mic feature.  I found myself removing the mic from other brands to get them out of the way, particularly while eating or something and then of course, having to remember where I put it and reattach when I wanted to chat.  Discord seems to be cooperating and not switching between multiple instances of the hardware (I am on wireless/lightspeed dongle, with the headphones plugged into a usb strip that is NOT connected to the computer)

    I had to get rid of my old head set and got this one to replace it. Overall this is a good headset, and I enjoy using it for gaming. Sound quality is good, nothing out of this world, but still good quality enough where I’d recommend it. One this I will warn is the volume scroller on the side sometimes gets messed with I lean back or lie down to watch a show, but this is a minor issue that shouldn’t typically be an issue. Also the cord length is not as long as I’d prefer, but it’s still a good length and again shouldn’t be an issue for most people. Mic works well, but it’s a bit finicky and sometimes when I play games and flip the mic up to mute it doesn’t actually mute in game. Does work in discord though. Headset is comfortable and the color (I got teal) is wonderful. It’s my favorite color and it looks the same as the pictures.TLDR: Good quality headphones, haven’t had any major issues with it, I’d recommend them if you’re thinking about getting these.

    My background: Saying I game a lot is an understatement. I probably spend about 30-40 hours a week on my pc both for work and gaming.

    Used these for about an hour and a half and it's been nothing short of a horrible experience.The product looks great but at this price point, it leaves a LOT to be desired. It feels cheap and flimsy.Sound quality: It feels really tinny and harsh and flat at the same time somehow. The highs are really sharp and loud and the lows are lacking and very flat. I experimented with the presents and the advanced EQ and even after about 20 minutes of messing around the sound was awful. The only upside is that you can set customer profiles for different games but it can't compensate for cheap drivers. A pair of $30 Samsons or Superluxes is 10 times better at sound stage and sound quality overall.Volume: The volume is extremely low which is really strange. I am guessing with the cheap driver it introduces a lot of distortion if the volume is turned up and it's unusable for gaming since you can barely hear anything. The volume knob doesn't have hard stops so as you are using them you keep wanting to turn the volume up but it just provides an obnoxious beeping sound for 1-2 seconds letting you know you are maxed out. If you turned the knob a few times since it doesn't have a hard stop it will beep at you for 5-6 seconds before you can hear anything.The G Hub software tries to do some sort of volume correction as well so when you tab between windows it lowers the volume and slowly brights it back up which is obnoxious.Latency: The latency seems pretty good but during my 1.5 hours of playtime I lost audio twice completely for no reason. I was playing CS2 and it just completely muted itself. I switched inputs and the audio was working fine on my speakers. I had to restart the headset and unplug it to get everything working again.Microphone: I have had better sound quality with a cheap $10 wired microphone. It's crunchy and flat and sounds a bit like a radio.Just as a point of reference, I came from using a pair of SteelSeries Arctis headset from 2017 that are about the same price, and if those are a 7/10 the Logitech G535 is maybe a 2/10 at best.Horrible controls, bad software, bad drivers, mediocre microphone (at least it works I guess). The only good thing is the battery life (I am basing that off of other reviews since I only used it for a short period).At this price, you can do much better. I would maybe pay $25 for something like this to keep in a closet in case of emergency but at a $100+ there are hundreds of better options out there.

    I like the sound quality and the wearing comfort. I can easily forget I have them on. I don't use the mic so I don't know how it sounds to other gamers. I have only had them for a couple of months, so I'm not sure about the durability. They feel durable. I like the positioning of the volume wheel. Easy to find and adjust.

    Comfort? 10/10. Sound quality? 1/10. I bought this because my dog ripped the cable on my Razer V3 X apart after he got his foot caught in the cord and thought it was chasing him. I was originally going to replace it with another V3 X because I liked that headset a lot, but out of curiosity I decided to scroll through all of the other headsets listed on Amazon and saw that this one was only $37 when it's normally $60 and couldn't pass that up. My first headset was an old Logitech g930 given to me by a neighbor and I loved it to death (literally, it disintegrated) so I thought that the same could be true for this one. Unfortunately, I was very wrong, this headset's build quality feels extremely cheap for having a base price of $60; my V3 X cost me $44 and its build quality was eons better than this one! Not to mention you can find it at Walmart for like $30 most of the time. The sound range and quality of this headset felt tinny and cheap as well, all I could hear were base-y, deep sounds and hardly anything else; ESPECIALLY ENEMY PLAYER FOOTSTEPS!! There's no way to adjust the headset digitally either because it doesn't have any software! In comparison, my V3 X is way more dynamic and has always been reliable, not to mention you can adjust it digitally in Razer Synapse. Overall, I can see how this would be a good option for a console gamer, it's cheap and has a 3.5mm to plug into your controller, but if you're a PC gamer like me I don't recommend this at all. Go get a Razer V3 X instead!

    Windows 11 w/ Discordset up painlessly with GHUB.These are sooooo much lighter than similar headsets from Logitech, Corsair, HyperX.  I love the boom mic feature.  I found myself removing the mic from other brands to get them out of the way, particularly while eating or something and then of course, having to remember where I put it and reattach when I wanted to chat.  Discord seems to be cooperating and not switching between multiple instances of the hardware (I am on wireless/lightspeed dongle, with the headphones plugged into a usb strip that is NOT connected to the computer)

    I had to get rid of my old head set and got this one to replace it. Overall this is a good headset, and I enjoy using it for gaming. Sound quality is good, nothing out of this world, but still good quality enough where I’d recommend it. One this I will warn is the volume scroller on the side sometimes gets messed with I lean back or lie down to watch a show, but this is a minor issue that shouldn’t typically be an issue. Also the cord length is not as long as I’d prefer, but it’s still a good length and again shouldn’t be an issue for most people. Mic works well, but it’s a bit finicky and sometimes when I play games and flip the mic up to mute it doesn’t actually mute in game. Does work in discord though. Headset is comfortable and the color (I got teal) is wonderful. It’s my favorite color and it looks the same as the pictures.TLDR: Good quality headphones, haven’t had any major issues with it, I’d recommend them if you’re thinking about getting these.

    This headset is great, the lightspeed transmission is better than bluetooth and has been very reliable.The audio quality is pretty fantastic, quite surprised me actually with how good it sounds especially compares to bluetooth headsets.The fit is comfortable and the battery life is decent, I get probably 20 hours out of them or more.The mic sounds pretty decent as well, pretty clear and not muffled or scratchy sounding.Overall a fantastic buy and I would definitely purchase again if these ever break.

    They are the most comfortable headset I have ever bought.  Very light with large ear pieces that fit around the ears not on them. Unlike some of my more expensive ones, these feel good after hours of wearing them!  The only drawback I have found, and it doesn't bother me at all, is you can hear sounds around you.

    I would say this is a really good headset for the price.Comfortable even with glasses.The fabric is nice on the ear cups. Never buying that fake leather crap that peals off and gets in my hair and all over the place.Mic boom is nice. Super handy to push it up and mute quickly. Good sound quality on the mic too.2 negatives I foundCord length is too short. Just needs another 2 feet.They say these are discord certified. But there are instances where I was playing a video that was playing through the headset and the mic was picking up the sound and playing it back. I have it on voice activity and automatic input sensitivity. The fix is either lowering the volume on what I am watching or turn off automatic input and set the db level my self but that sometimes does not work and I can get cut off because I talk with a low voice. Sometimes it stops doing this if I push the mic further away from my face.This is a five star headset but I am bringing it down to 4 only because they say this headset is discord certified but the mic playback tells me they don't certify nothing and it's just a paid partnership marketing scam. I really don't think they ""certify"" these headsets.Other then that the headset is great and I am enjoying it a lot. It's way more comfortable then my last headset. If you want a comparison to the HyperX Could wireless headset read below.When compared to the HyperX Cloud I, not the Cloud II. Both side by side have the same sound and mic quality. But Logitech headset wins on comfort. The Cloud headset lost it's durability on the band so the headset did not grip my head anymore and would slip off my head all the time.Ear cups on the HyperX would peel off and get everywhere. Logitech is fabric with nice memory foam. Much prefer logitech ear cups. Super comfy.The mic on the HyperX had no issues and really liked that mic. I would say HyperX mic is better only because the discord playback issue I have with logitech is sometimes annoying.HyperX wireless, I would say wireless headsets are worth. The fact that I can stand up and go to my kitchen while still talking and listening in discord is great.I do miss that about being wireless.With wired ones you have to set it down and stop the conversation to check on something.I would say get this headset but wireless.Best value LogitechBest quality HyperXBest comfort - LogitechBest durability - N/A still need to wear logitech for a little longer to find out.

    Very good for the price. The cord is just a tad short, it’s maybe 4-5 feet long. I almost never use the mic so I’m glad it lifts out of the way. Powered by a creative G6 sound card it sounds plenty loud with decent bass for most types of music. Once you adjust the ear cup height the comfort is great.

    My son's been gaming about 11 years now. We allowed headphones for high school and college work and for music listening. Ok - so all and I mean ALLLLL of the xbox headsets where complete trash. They broke easily and just hurt his head. he would wear a beanie to stand the pressure on the top of his head. Anyway, I went online here and physically tried 3 sets of headphones with swing mic, noise cancelling, padded head.Set 2 back b/c they were tight on the head or just felt terrible and mic use/mute was odd for gaming (so I'm told). IDK why I didn't jsut look for logitech (forgive me). My daughter loves hers b/c they are light weight and have the usb connector for her laptop. I had to find out if these with the 3.5mm jack would work well on his xbox one.  EUREKA!  Perfect fit - it displaces the weight of the headphones for a great feel over the head - no pinching, good noise cancelling, makes gaming great to hear!  Logitech is clearly the way to go with either the USB or 3.5mm jack connectors.

    My Logitech Pro X headset died. I didn't feel like spending $250 to replace it so, based on a review I read which listed them as the best ""Bang for the Buck"" option, I bought these. They're not great but... if affordable and function are your primary criteria I highly recommend this headset.

    As a gamming wireless headset Logitech does a good job. One gripe, the headband is at max and it's snuggly comfortable with no other expansion option. I have a big head, but the only adjustment is the inside top head strap which has 2 positions. Mine is at largest and like I said snuggly comfortable, I can live with it but a larger adjustment range would have been appreciated. Logitech usually does a super job, and I have no problem with their wireless mouse's, headset even keyboard. Other brands have been problematic. I drop the keyboard wireless for a wired mechanical gamming one but that was my choice. You usually can't go wrong with Logitech.
