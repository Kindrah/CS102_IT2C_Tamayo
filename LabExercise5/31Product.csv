    This mouse is so amazing I can not express my feelings enough how good it is. At first I thought it is on the large size (which is a bit) but I am also sort of big guy, so fits my hand perfectly. It is ultra light weight. with the mouse pad from SteelSeries also it is perfect match. The app is very straight forward to configure the mouse and speed scenarios, during the gaming and other usage you can easily change with one click, super easy.Now the downsides:Battery life is quiet short comparet to office type wireless mouses, heavy gaming like 10 hours a day lasted me 3 days, approx 30 hours :). Using it cable plugged actually didnt affect the steering too much, so most of the time using cable attached and for my friends I purchased 2 more non wireless version of this.Not sure if it is downside but since it is so lightweight, when you try to click side button which is up/down direction you can not hold the mouse stable, it moves, so lets say you are playing a shooter game, scope is open and want to use down button on the side, there is no way you will stay on target and press the down button at the same time.Over all, I am very happy with it, fits my hand perfectly, speed variations and smoothness is amazing, high quality with matching RGB with my SteelSeries keyboard, go for it...

    I am an avid player of First Person Shooter games (FPS) and as such I demand a low weight, high precision input device.  The Aerox 5 fits the bill for me.  I am coming from a pedigree of Basic Packard Bell (1990s) -> Microsoft Explorer -> Razer Deathadder -> G502 -> Glorious Model D Wireless -> Aerox 5.While I really enjoyed the Glorious Model D, I immediately missed the extra buttons from my G502.  I adjusted to the reduction in mouse buttons by grabbing a foot pedal for PTT voice comms (similar pedal: https://amzn.to/3VwdEuD) which turned out to be an amazing upgrade.The Model D only lasted a few months before the scroll wheel malfunctioned.  The wheel would randomly scroll causing me to weapon switch during intense left-click firefights. The right click mouse button also started sticking.So, looking for an upgrade, I stumbled upon the Aerox 5.The things that immediately drew me to the Aerox 5 were the 9 programmable buttons. I love that the mouse is an ultra light, weighing only slightly more than the Model D I was upgrading from. The mouse is pretty much perfect in every way, however there are a couple of annoying things I will point out here:1. The dongle is USB-C.  I do not have a USB-C port in my PC, so I was running the dongle with a long USB-A -> USB-C connection... until I stumbled upon the direct plug adapter (2nd pic).  You can get one of those here https://amzn.to/3GmkoH6.  I wish they had included one with the mouse.2. The mouse profiles in the SteelSeries GG software don't reliably automatically switch.  I have different profiles set up for each of my games with different button bindings and while the profile normally switches just fine, it's not 100% reliable.  Easy to fix.  I would recommend just having the 1 default profile and setting the extra mouse buttons to the NUMPAD keys and then change your key bindings in game accordingly. That way you don't have to mess with profile switching.  That's how I'll be setting it up once I reformat and lose these profiles.3. There is no DPI indicator light on the mouse that I can tell.4. The battery life is not the greatest but more than adequate.  It'll last 2 or 3 days before needing a charge.  I normally just connect it back up when I'm done playing and never really notice it.All in all, a great mouse and I highly recommend it.

    Love this mouse - it's about half the weight of my previous logitech mouse; and super comfy for long hours of gaming. Had it for a few months now and haven't had any issues at all. Clicks super nicely; is super reactive; and looks nice on the desk. Only tidbit is that you cant click the scroll wheel sideways to side scroll; so it's not much use for spreadsheets and the like! But my favorite mouse I have owned so far.

    I recently purchased a mouse from SteelSeries, and overall, it has been a solid performer. This review will provide an in-depth analysis of the product, highlighting its pros and cons.Pros:  Lightweight Design: The mouse is skeletonized, making it incredibly light. This feature contributes to enhanced maneuverability and reduces fatigue during extended gaming or work sessions. The lightweight nature of the mouse allows for swift and precise movements.  Eye-catching RGB Lights: The RGB lighting on the mouse is visually appealing and adds a touch of flair to your gaming setup. The vibrant colors and effects create an immersive experience, especially in a gaming environment. However, it's worth noting that the aesthetics might not be suitable for a professional work setting.  Thumb Buttons: The mouse boasts five conveniently placed buttons for the thumb. These extra buttons can be customized to suit your needs, providing quick access to macros or other functions. The intuitive placement of these buttons enhances gaming and productivity, allowing for seamless control and efficiency.  Excellent Supporting Software: SteelSeries provides downloadable software that complements the mouse perfectly. This software allows you to customize various aspects of the mouse, including DPI settings, button mapping, and RGB lighting effects. The extensive customization options ensure that the mouse can be tailored to your specific preferences and gaming style.Cons:  Awkwardly Placed Buttons: One notable drawback is that two of the mouse buttons are situated in unconventional locations, making them awkward to use. These buttons require pressing them either upwards or downwards, which can be uncomfortable and disruptive to your grip. As a result, some users, including myself, tend to avoid using these particular buttons altogether.  Gamer Aesthetic: The mouse design clearly leans towards a gamer-centric style. While this may be a positive aspect for gaming enthusiasts, it may not appeal to individuals seeking a more subtle or professional-looking mouse. The aggressive styling and RGB lighting might not blend well with a professional work environment.  Battery Life: The battery life isn't terrible but it's also not great. It does come with a fabric usb cable to charge it and it charges very fast, but the shorter battery life can be annoying if it dies while in use.In conclusion, the SteelSeries mouse offers several impressive features that make it a desirable choice for gamers and enthusiasts. Its lightweight design, customizable thumb buttons, and captivating RGB lighting add value to the overall user experience. Additionally, the supporting software provides extensive customization options.However, it's important to note that the placement of two buttons can be awkward, leading to discomfort and the potential for limited usage. Furthermore, the gamer aesthetic may not be suitable for everyone, especially those seeking a more professional-looking mouse.If you prioritize a lightweight and customizable gaming mouse and appreciate the visual appeal of RGB lighting, this mouse is worth considering. Just be aware of the potential button placement issues and ensure that the gamer-centric design aligns with your preferences and environment.

    Lightweight, works well wired and wireless.I mostly use it wired, so I don't notice the battery drain. It doesn't last too long wireless though. Maybe a day or two of being used. The wireless connection is very nice, and I don't notice any delay. It also doesn't disconnect on me while in use. The mouse comes with a usb-c to usb-a cable, usb-c wireless receiver, and a passthrough adapter for the receiver and cable. This is real nice for keeping the receiver close to the mouse in case you need to switch to wired for charging or switch back to wireless.The topmost side button works as two. Pushing up or pressing downward count as different buttons, and they can be configured in Steelseries GG. They are slightly awkward to use since it's a different motion than I'm used to, but the other side buttons work perfectly.The dpi button let's you switch between 5 pre-set options, but I changed these immediately in GG since they were too low or too high for my preferences.Overall it's a great mouse. Price is steep, but if you get it on sale, it is absolutely worth it. The biggest downside is using the GG software; however, I was already using it for Sonar and my keyboard, so I've learned to live with it.

    On day one of using this mouse I started experiencing issues with the 2.4GHz wireless connection randomly dropping for 5 to 10 seconds at a time. I switched over to using Bluetooth and it was also having issues with it losing the connection. I thought maybe it was an issue with my PC, but after troubleshooting with firmware updates, resetting to factory defaults, driver reinstalls, and BIOS updates I was still having the issue. On top of that I have other peripherals connected via 2.4GHz and Bluetooth that don't have any problems with their connections.After trying all the troubleshooting I figured it was faulty hardware so I opened a support ticket with SteelSeries. I gave them the purchase information and serial number they flat out said they would not help me because the mouse was ""still within it's return period with Amazon"". I told them I was aware that I could just return it, but that I had bought it on Black Friday which meant the return window was a few months away due to the holiday return policy. The only option I had was to return it (not exchange) and since the price had increased since I bought it I'd have to pay another $50 if I returned to rebuy it. They reiterated that they would not help and I could either return and rebuy it from Amazon or wait two months for SteelSeries to offer warranty support.At the end of the day I'm glad they didn't offer me support because while I was waiting for my return window to end I discovered the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro and it is SO MUCH BETTER. It may not be as lightweight, but it feels so much better in the hand and the responsiveness and button placement is top notch.Aerox 5 Wireless - 1/5 stars. Would not recommend.

    Tried several options for my weird grip (Claw/Palm) hybrid with small/medium hand, I wanted something to update my old g604, the closest I got was the Raid mouse from HyperX but that one isn't wireless and it didn't feel as accurate as the 604. I loved this one from SteelSeries though, it feels more accurate than the g604, the weight is amazing. Don't care much about the RGB but at least it turns off when you are using it. Don't like the tilt up down system of the top side button would rather have 2 regular buttons instead but at least it has 2 additional buttons, its not easy to find a light mouse with more than 2 side buttons these days. Regarding the grey aim button, I can't even reach it but it doesn't get in my way so I don't mind.Pros:Many buttons with great weightBluetooth optionPlastic feels niceSoftware is okScroll wheel reachableCons:Aiming grey button too far for small/med handTilting side button system instead of regular buttonBattery doesn't feel lasting 180Hrs

    Anecdote -- I got into SteelSeries because Logitech wasn't keeping up with the times, their software sucked, their products were boring. SteelSeries revitalized the industry when Razer got complacent and wasn't producing great products. You knew back then that if you got a steelseries it would last you forever with no problems with it. I don't know who I'm going to switch to next...What's good --Feel in the hand,Weight,Mouse Buttons,Responsive-ness whatever wireless tech they use is great.What's bad --Mousewheel failure -- they use a weird ratchet spring retention mechanism to track mousewheel scrolling and it does not stand the test of time. I've had this mouse for a year, and already it's failing. Down scrolls get measure as double up scrolls, mouse up scrolls get ignored. It's just not a good design.Maintenance -- it's impossible to take this mouse apart without breaking a few tabs. why... why is it needlessly difficult to take it apart.the Up/Down paddle on the left side -- most games don't recognize it's function so i have it bound to ""1"" and ""2"" for most applications. It's just weird... Hard to push up, easy to push down.Battery life sucks, i don't see why they could offer a larger battery / heavier weight variant ...

    I used this mouse for work and at home for 4 months. The mouse was great to use for the time that everything worked, but after the 4-month mark I started noticing that the scroll wheel wasn't scrolling in the direction I moved it consistently, and the left mouse button would occasionally register double-clicks when I was only single-clicking.I'm an avid PC user, so I bought this mouse as a replacement for an old SS mouse that was about 1-2 years old that had also started having these problems, as well as a replacement for the ~$10 mice that my workplace provides me whenever the last $10 mouse fails.I've had a lot of SteelSeries gear in the last 10 years, and while the headset and keyboard are still very solid, their mice have gotten significantly worse in terms of quality and reliability within the last 3-5 years.The fact that this mouse didn't last 4 months before it started showing problems already had me a bit shaken, but going to the SS website to ask for a replacement was the rest of the iceberg that I ran aground on that led me to give this 1 star. Upon opening the ticket, the person assisting me apologized that I was experiencing this issue and asked me to make a video recording of the problems with the scroll wheel and left mouse button using a website, and also wanted me to provide a picture of the serial number (even though I'd already provided the serial number with the ticket).I tried using the website provided to test the issue and make the recording, but the indicator that I was supposed to take a recording of on the site wasn't locked in place, so it was impossible to record while testing the scroll wheel.So they gave me a middling website to use to make a ""proof"" video of the specific issue I was having, and so I asked - rather nicely- that they address the issue on their own time and just send me a replacement. I'd already been stuck with a malfunctioning mouse for a month (at this point only ~5 months into owning it), so I didn't feel like leaping over hurdles or jumping through hoops to replace something that had a number of defects.But after doing this everything went south. The next response was a wall-of-text containing their RMA procedure, some legaleese about SS having the right to protect itself from fraudulent claims, further explanation as to why they needed pictures of the unit, the serial number (again), etc.I'd already provided the serial number when I submitted the ticket, as well as a picture of it and proof of purchase with the ""Please diagnose the issue on your own time."" response. So the legaleese that asked for both of these _again_ was clearly just copy-pasted by the rep and a further waste of my time.So I take a video of the malfunctioning mouse using a different website that could actually be recorded easily, took pictures of all sides of the unit, and gave them everything they asked for - including the items I had already provided. And the next response I got was another massive wall-of-text describing the steps I needed to go to in order for me to DESTROY the mouse before they even committed to an RMA replacement.So this person hadn't provided me with a replacement, or a coupon to be able to purchase a replacement unit through their website yet... but I was supposed to DESTROY the mouse that I still owned and used at home and at work before they sent me a replacement.Excuse me? You need me to destroy the $130 item I bought from you before you even commit to providing me a replacement? What in the absolute f*** kind of an RMA process is that?After further wasting my time scanning through the legaleese the rep responded with, the ""alternative"" is for me to BUY a new mouse from their website using a code they provide. And if I jump over all their hurdles and through the remainder of their hoops, then they just might refund me for the new mouse.The whole process feels like absolute codswallop. Maybe if they don't renege on their RMA once I have the new mouse I ordered with my own money in hand, I'll come back here and bump this up to 2 stars.Boy, do I sure love a company that makes me waste my time, makes no promises of following through on the RMA, and asks me to either destroy the thing I have or buy a brand new one just to finally have a chance at something that doesn't have defects. Gee, thanks SteelSeries!Update: I updated my review to 2 stars. After the original mouse was RMA'd, the second mouse also started having a slightly different problem about 3-4 months later. The middle mouse button click sometimes wouldn't register. I was able to RMA it again, and it went much faster this time since I knew they'd want video proof, pictures of the S/N, etc. But I'm now on my third one of these and hoping that this one doesn't also start experiencing similar problems by the time the warranty period has expired. Overall, the mouse itself is great. Having both a wireless dongle and bluetooth pairing option is extremely beneficial, but these issues with the mouse buttons starting to malfunction a few months in feels very anti-consumer.

    Pros:1. Wireless battery feels like it lasts forever.2. Lighting and RGB looks great.3. GG Engine is easy to use and program for the mouse and it's settings.4. Shape and design is visually appealing (preference).5. Moving from wired to Wireless mode is seamless and including cord is long as HECK.Cons:1. Scroll wheel tends to reverse imput often (try to scroll down and it will scroll up a bit at the same time as down). But I think this is an issue with just my mouse and 2 others I know with this mouse does not have this issue.2. I love the overall shape but the large silver thumb button feels just to far away to be useful or easy to press when needed in the heat of a game.3. The thumb button up/down motion is great in theory however the down press at times can be hard to trigger causing clicks to do nothing if you are not in the right spot, and the up button is also difficult as its so easy to click mouse 4 while trying to push up on the flip button.Overall I really like this mouse, it satisfied my need for a few extra buttons to use during gamming without getting a full 12 button MMO mouse which is just too many buttons for me. With a few adjustments I feel like this could be a near perfect mouse for me in the future.

    This mouse is fast and floats on the pad, and is lightest mouse with 3 side buttons i could find, and i love it, its a heavy pricetag for a mouse, but if your a hardcore gamer like I am in FPS and looters shooters especially, this mouse performs excellent. It's about the same size as logitech g502 heroI bought it because it was on sale for 100$ I was going to get the Glorious O 2 wireless super light (but they only have 2 side buttons) or the Glorious model I 2 MMO wireless but was a little heavier and reviews about the side buttons made me weary (They are both around 100$ but usually has a discount of 10/20%)I'm glad I got this one and have no buyers remorse. I mainly play Escape from Tarkov, and many other games that require to many keybinds that if you don't have more then 2 side mouse buttons you're breaking your left hand with all the combination key binding (pressing multiple keys to perform action) as use my side mouse button for leaning I need thar extra trigger for toggling and combo hot keying it with a keyboard bind.The battery seems decent enough to last a few days of constant playing and use, I use my PC for work as well as gaming so I definitely probably drain a battery faster then most, and the fact you can charge and use wired is great as well.The only con I see is the price which if if you catch a sale isn't bad, the Steel Series proprietary software that pushes a Ad page every time you open is to adjust settings (i really hate when companies do this like i bought your stuff let me use it without tryin to push more stuff) the fact you can't seen the RGB lighting when your using it (which isn't really a problem for me since u dont care but figured someone might think it is)All and all I love this mouse very much and can't recommend it enough.

    For the most part, it's been a fantastic addition to my gaming setup. It performs admirably, providing precision and speed that enhance my gaming experience.The ergonomic design of the mouse fits comfortably in my hand, and the customizable buttons have been a boon for my gaming sessions. It's been a joy to use for gaming-related functions.However, there is one notable drawback that I've encountered, especially for Mac users. The hotkey binding for Mac does not work as expected. I tried to bind the side key with the Mac mission control shortcut, but despite my efforts, I was unable to get it to function correctly. Even after downloading the SteelSeries app to customize the mouse's settings, the issue persisted.Despite this setback, the mouse's primary gaming performance remains top-notch, and it has certainly improved my gaming experience.

    I come from using a much heavier mouse so switching to this ultra light-weight mouse is taking some getting used to. Tinkering with the engine settings in the GG app is a must to get your CPI settings right.I really like the button placement, though the 7-8 can be a bit awkward since they are up and down rather than push in. The 9 button is placed a little further out so it prevents accidental presses which was a major problem with my previous mouse. I *highly* recommend using a mouse bungee to keep your cord off the desk because of the weight of the mouse. Otherwise the tiniest bit of drag from the cord can affect your aim or move the mouse.As far as keeping it clean, I use a can of compressed air to blow it out every couple of days because my place is a dust factory. I wear compression gloves so getting oils on the open parts of the mouse aren't an issue, and a simple wipe of the buttons with an alcohol prep pad takes care of the buttons.In terms of playing games until you dial in those CPI settings you may have some issues with your aim, especially if you are doing fast-twitch things like FPS. However being able to create profiles for programs is very useful, even if you have to actually know where your program is located to select the executable file to make one. It does switch seamlessly when you click in and out of programs so there's a definite plus. Unfortunately there aren't any built-in integrations with programs like Discord so you'll have to rely on setting up keys with program hotkeys.The RGB settings aren't the most advanced and a bit difficult to set up in comparison to other devices I've used. If that's super important to you you may not be happy with this, but for me personally I'm not bothered.In summary, it's a good mouse, and if you can pick it up on sale like I did it's well worth it. Keep in mind this is a really light mouse and there will be an adjustment period if you're coming from something heavy. Setting it up with the software takes a bit more know-how than other programs for other brands.

    The mouse is pretty lightweight, which I'm not used to, so it took a while to get accustomed to it. The left and right mouse buttons were extremely sensitive the first two or three weeks, so I was accidentally clicking frequently when I didn't mean to. It seemed to just be a break-in period because almost 2 months in and it's much better now.My only issue is that the battery life doesn't seem to match the 180+ hour that was marketed, though even the marketing is inconsistent. The listing title states 180+ hours, but the product details states up to 180 hours. If I unplug the mouse to use it wirelessly, it maybe lasts 48-60 hours before it flashes red to indicate it needs to be plugged in. I initially thought it might have just been flashing red as a normal part of it switching colors, until it disconnected several minutes later until I charged it for a while. There's software that lets you turn off the RGB to extend the battery life, but I'd rather play with the RGB, it's just the product details could be a bit more transparent on what we can expect battery life-wise.

    This gaming mouse had me swooning at first glance. The ergonomic design cradled my hand like a glove, the buttons danced under my fingertips with satisfying clicks, and the wireless freedom felt like shackles cast off. I was a gaming ninja, a pixelated warrior unleashed.But then, the battery life reared its ugly head. Like a party guest who overstays their welcome, it lingered, draining the energy and excitement from every session. A casual hour of slaying dragons? Nope, gotta plug it in halfway through. An intense competitive match? Pray to the tech gods that it lasts.Don't get me wrong, the features are fantastic. The sensor is a precision beast, tracking my every twitch with laser-like focus. The side buttons are a macro maestro's dream, letting me unleash complex combos with a single squeeze. And the RGB lighting? A symphony of customizable colors that would make any unicorn envious.But all the bells and whistles can't mask the constant drumbeat of impending battery death. It's like having a Ferrari with a fuel gauge that's permanently stuck on ""E."" The thrill of the ride is constantly tempered by the fear of running out of gas.So, to the aspiring gamer considering this mouse, I say tread carefully. If you're a casual warrior, content with short bursts of pixelated glory, it might be a decent fit. But for the die-hards who crave hours of uninterrupted domination, look elsewhere. This sleek beauty ultimately falls short in the marathon, leaving you stranded and frustrated (and possibly reaching for the dreaded wired backup).Pros:Ergonomic designHyper-responsive sensorCustomizable buttons and RGB lightingWireless freedom (for a while)Cons:Abysmal battery lifeConstant charging anxietyNot for marathon gaming sessionsOverall: A potentially amazing mouse crippled by a power problem. Consider your gaming habits carefully before taking the plunge.

    Only real problem I had was trying to change the lighting settings, and it would save them, when the mouse would go into rest mode it would lose the lighting settings, but after a few searches I figured it all out and got it working right. Haven’t used the double up/down button on the side yet, never been a big mouse button user, but clicking it down isn’t the easiest, up is fine and I’d rather have it as an option then not, and may use it as a macro button.I know some have complained about battery life, this is my first wireless gaming mouse, and it’s not too bad, get 3+ days with the lighting turned off, and worst comes to worst you can plug it in and use it like a normal mouse, and it charges to 50%+ in under 30 mins.

    Overall, a great mouse. Light, though not quite as light as some of the competition. Trading off more weight for more buttons and better ergonomics is worth it to me as it is a very comfortable mouse to use (coming from a Rival 600 it's nearly identical in shape), and the number of extra side buttons (5 + 1 top) is very convenient. Have also not noticed any additional input lag in wireless dongle mode vs wired (haven't tried bluetooth).Battery life has been fine. Not great, not terrible. When used as a daily driver, I can get about 3 days out of it (mixed use work + gaming). When used only after-work basically just for a couple hours of gaming a day, I get about 5 days.I will say it was annoying to get the thing paired to my PC with the little receiver dongle. You really do have to use the same cable for charging and the receiver dongle to get the best results.

    The mouse itself gets a 4.5/5 star for me. Great feel to it (claw grip). Great pads, very smooth, switches/scroll wheel feel amazing and it’s light. (Have yet to test battery life). The software gets a 1/10 lol. It’s the worst mouse software I’ve used, between Corsair, Logitech, and even red dragon. Bringing the average overall to a 3. ITS CRAZY, imagine having an amazing product, and the im giving it a 3 over your software? The software is steel series GG. It operates as a game capture software, aim trainer, add platform for their products, etc.. It does everything but be a good mouse software. It constantly runs in the background, even if you turn off game capture/auto clips it still pops up with the overlay in every game. My BIGGEST complaint about it is I have played on 850 dpi my whole life. This is the first mouse EVER that I can’t. Their software dpi editing only operates in 100 increments, so you either could do 800 or 900 but not 850. That may sound crazy to you but when you’ve played on a sensitivity for 17 years, it matter. That reason alone I will be returning it. Last issue that really bothers me, is the rgb settings, for the mouse? You can set them, but it DOESNT EVEN WORK LOL. Very common complaint I have seen here but I thought it may just be intermittently working. Nope it just doesn’t work at all and the rgb does it’s own thing. STEEL SERIES YOU HAVE AN AMAZING MOUSE, FIX YOUR SOFTWARE.

    I moved up from Aerox 3 and it was the best decision. I've got slightly larger than average hands with longer fingers and this mouse fits perfectly. Software is intuitive and doesn't require you to create an account in order to have access to it (looking at you, razer).I have all of the illumination turned off to save battery life and it lasts plenty of time.I wish this had a wireless charging capability, as plugging it in once in a while does get a bit old.Overall: 5 out 5!

    Maybe it's just me, I have a different mouse that currently allows me to add weights if needed. Perhaps that has skewed my judgement on this however, the weight of this mouse is super light, the cursor (even with adjusting sensitivity to the lowest setting my my computer) is really speedy. Makes playing shooter games a little harder to play when the mouse is that sensitive. There aren't any other settings that I can see to change. I liked the idea of the holes for your palm to breath though. That is a great concept

    I've used this mouse little over one month now. Overall, this mouse is pretty light and decent itself for gaming. But then I am not sure if only mine does this, the left click doesn't work sometimes. I need to click it with little more power than any other mouse I've used.I was too lazy to return and get new one, then after a month, I am just used to it so doesn't bother me much . Since right click doesn't have problem, I guess only mine is defect one.Thou, I would recommend this mouse if you prefer light weight mouse.

    The mouse worked great for the first few months. However, the battery started to not last as long after a full charge. I began to have connection issues where it would just turn off, and then back on. I'm not sure If I maybe got a bad mouse, but its usability went down fast. It wasn't a computer software issue as I tried it out on multiple computers.It slipped off my desk onto the tile and landed on the skeleton backing, it cracked, and decided to buy a new mouse.Overall it's not bad, I would just recommend buying a different brand mouse.

    Update: After using the mouse continually for a few days, I've been able to adjust some to the honey comb on the clicking surfaces (without using tape). Adding one star as I've enjoyed the mouse more since the initial review, but still not a sound design decision for future models.---- original review ---I just received both the Aerox 5 and 9 for prime day with the intent of playing high APM games like StarCraft II. Unfortunately right off the bat I can tell they may have to be returned, as the honey comb extends too far into the mouse buttons to the point that it digs into your fingers when clicking frequently. I don't know if my hands are just too small (I think they are average medium size) or that I use more than just the tip of my fingers to click, but as an ergonomic mouse the entire button click surfaces should *always* be completely solid and comfortable. (I understand the goal to save weight, but the extra 1g is definitely not worth it.)For now I have taped over the portion of the honey comb on the left/right click buttons, which is pretty janky to have to do at this price point. Nonetheless the rest of the mouse is nice as you'd expect; I'll be seeing if I can live with the tape, else they'll be returned.

    There are many imitators of this mouse from the Glorious Gaming one to many others, but none will match the original. By far the best looking mouse on the market, and decent customizability on the RGB effects, but no segmentation. Truly amazing waterproofing! Will withstand any amount of direct spills of water despite all the holes it seems to have. The battery lasts a few days, which is better than some but not close to others that last months (though without RGB effects.) I'd say it's worth about half the listed price, if you can get it from Amazon Warehouse in good condition or catch a deal.

    They make a terrible keyboard but this mouse is amazing. At least they managed to get something right! The only thing I don't like is how cheap the scroll wheel feels. Which was an odd choice because the rest of the mouse feels premium.

    Let me start by saying how much I love Steelseries products. I have, and use daily, an Apex Pro and Arctis Nova Pro. My mouse before this one was an Aerox 5 wired and I really liked that mouse but wanted to ditch the wire. So I figured the wireless version would be perfect and I would love it as much as all the other Steelseries peripherals I have purchased. Unfortunately I was very, very wrong.First off, the positives, of which there are a few. It fits my hand perfectly which I often have a hard time with as my hand tends to be too big for smaller mice but too small for bigger mice. The weight was really good for me too. There are plenty lighter mice but this was right about where I like it to be and the materials feel good as well and not super cheap or flimsy. All the buttons feel good too without feeling squishy.Unfortunately that about does it for the positives, so here come the issues I had with it in the almost 6 months of daily use I've put it through. The battery life is abysmal and borders on false advertising with what they state it is. I had to charge it every day and ended up having to use it plugged in quite often, which obviously completely defeats the purpose of a wireless mouse. It's supposed to be better on Bluetooth but that's because it locks a very low polling rate and disables many features available on 2.4g.It would also constantly disconnect or fail to reconnect after going to sleep, which I have found many complaints about from others who have had the misfortune of purchasing this mouse as well. The final straw was the mouse cursor lagging almost like the sensor was cutting out on long sweeps. As of now it's barely usable less than 6 months after purchase so I'm replacing it with a Logitech.I still have a strong affinity for Steelseries but I think I am going to skip their mice until they start making better ones. The wireless Aerox mice seem to be a problem for many who buy them and I haven't seen any comment or even acknowledgment from Steelseries at all, which isn't a good look. Maybe I just got a bad one, which is entirely possible, but I still absolutely cannot recommend this mouse to anyone.

    Connects fast and love being able to have it connected USB wireless to my PS5, Wired to Mac, and Bluetooth to iPad with a flick of a switch. When on my computer, the GG app lets me switch profiles based on app open and using to make accessing macros and game specific custom controls adds another layer to the joy.CPI button quickly adjust speed which is handy when going between a 50” screen for PS5 and Mac and shifting to a much smaller iPad Pro where a lower CPI helps a lot. Get it.

    I've been looking for a general mouse to replace my old HyperX Pulsefire. This mouse is great (can be wired, wireless or bluetooth) so I can connect it to a few computers. It has 3 stars because:1. It is really fragile, especially the side button that clicks up and down. That button popped out of place on an unfortunate tumble off the ergo mouse tray and stayed on a click down position. Luckily you can ignore that button in the Steelseries GG software2. It is very hard to take the mouse apart. It doesn't pop out like other mice when you remove the bottom screws. It looks like just the entire bottom plate comes off but it is the bottom plate + the right side of the mouse together. If you try to pop the bottom plate off by itself, you'll break 2 really thin pieces of plastic held by small screws that you can't really see. Since the mouse is lightweight, Steelseries opted for very thin plastic that will snap if you bend it a tad too far. 18 screws later and 4 broken retention clips, I was able to redo the side button and put the mouse back mostly together. It still works. Some of the screws are hidden behind other plastics and the bottom mouse PCB so you'll need a very thin Philips screwdriver for that.

    Es un mouse excelente para los juego que prefiero (fps de supervivencia, tácticos y mmo rpg).Es muy ligero, la batería día unos 3 días aproximadamente ( 8 horas por día), a mí parecer la carga de la batería es rápida. Lo malo es que las luces consumen mucha batería.El software es un poco complicado pero tiene bastantes opciones y funciona bien.La construcción del mouse de siente un poco frágil, pero no me ha dado problemas. El botón que está frente al pulgar es un poco incómodo de usar, pero eso evita que lo presiones sino querer. Es un mouse para una mano de 17cm o mayor.

    I love this company- the other products of theirs I have are just top tier. This mouse also seems well made and is exceptionally light, and the design seems great for keeping your hands from getting sweaty. BUT the forward thumb button is not a DPI clutch. It looks like one. It’s where one should be. But it is not a DPI clutch, and there is no setting to make it one. This isn’t a huge deal if you aren’t used to playing with a DPI clutch, but if you are used to it and expecting it, this product is a disappointment. For a company that otherwise makes top tier gaming mice, it seems like a weird detail to overlook, and honestly, it might be an easy fix on the software side to just add DPI clutch as an optional functionality. It’s on me for not reading up more on the mouse before I bought it, but again, I have come to expect cutting edge from this company, so that lack of functionality was just something I expected… especially because the button is right there! I really hope this is a feature they add later, because I want to give this thing an honest try. Please add DPI clutch functionality to what could definitely be a top-tier peripheral!

    To save you time from reading my rant the 4 main take aways are: The scroll wheel is a common issue with all of their mice (Experienced it with 2 aerox, 1 prime, and 3 rivals). The quality for the price isn't up to par, the battery life is overstated, and the RMA process needs improvement.I felt this mouse was a little over priced compared to the quality I've received from other brands at this price point. I'd compare it to the quality of the Glorious brand mice, which is exactly where this one landed for me.I've been a loyal customer to steel series for some time, partly because I didn't know as much about computer accessories as I do now. From dealing with them over the years, I've noticed a downward trend in quality and customer service all while keeping premium pricing.From the 2 aerox that I've owned, the scroll wheel encoder has been the main issue from what I can tell. When scrolling down or up, the wheel tends to bounce back and forth between directions. This can be frustrating in game when changing camera zoom or weapons, as well as simply surfing the internet. The problem existed from the start with both of them, but I waited until it was completely unbearable to see if RMA'ing would be worth it. This is where the experience really changed my opinion about steel series.In order to process the RMA, they make you jump through various loops with there super generic scripts that are meant to make you feel like they care, all though it's more like they're not even listening. Following all the trouble shooting and submitting the personal info to process an RMA, they then tell you that your RMA is pending but they want you to either destroy the product and send evidence of it destroyed, or pay to send it back to their facility so they can then send you a new unit. This means you'd have to go without a mouse for some time, and potentially dish out money to get a replacement that is likely to show up with the same issue.

    Tried razer, logi, glorious, Asus,cooler master,and some others I gave this mouse a try and the shape fits my hand and does not cause it to cramp up after a few hours of use. It is light but doesn't feel cheap. The main buttons feel decent and the scroll wheel clicks and feel good. The side buttons are ok, a bit close together for thumb use , but functional with a bit of wobble as well as pre and post travel. The glides are average like what you would expect to get with any mouse in the price range. I traded them out for some glass glides from Pulsar and use it on a fnatic XL desk mat.The sensor is good although sometimes the the input lag doesn't always catch some of the rapid clicking when you already have one of the main buttons pressed, I brought this up in an email to there support a month ago but have no heard anything back. I wish the tracking was a little faster and smoother but understand that the firmware for the price point can only do so much.

    I’ll start with the knot picky cons first then work my way to the few pros of this disappointing purchase .  Firstly the mouse feet are hands down the worst I’ve encountered in years and would need replaced with third party feet right away as they literally grind on my pad, again steel series falls short on a major feature as they did on their Arctis Nova Pro ear pads . Next the weight , it’s very bottom heavy which I will assume is due to the RGB having defusers placed over them which is nice but not needed . And adds extra drag , now here comes another big no no they for some unknown reason on a “Wired” mouse added a detachable usb c cable it stay tightly attached but the paracord is stiff and heavy even on a bungee I felt very tethered and restrained no matter what I did . Also denounce timing cannot be adjusted via the software and it preset in the firmware is terrible Steel Series needs to unlock this in an update for the users and update the software allowing them to adjust it as they see fit.  Now to the few pros , if you like RGB it looks nice and GG has lots of nice apps for RGB blah blah blah… oh wait that’s it? Yep!  In short buy a better priced mouse like one of the line up from Glorious , if you want to spend this much buy one from Pulsar .

    The hardware and form factor are fine enough.But oof, the software!The “SteelSeries GG” setup software is master software that apparently services and hawks all the different types of SS peripherals - mice, keyboards, headsets, speakers - and also peripheral apps that also get installed with the GG software.If you look hard enough you can find in that mish-mash the tabs to click to access your mouse setup facility.The GG software install wants you to set up an account with SteelSeries in order to complete the install.  If you are careful, you can install without making an account, but it is suggested that you will have diminished functionality.The GG software install defaults to always starting on system bootup.  This switch, if you can find it, can be turned off, but there will be a scary message that you will be missing out on functionality.An account with SS and always on software, especially for just a mouse, well. that smells like data mining.  And the terms and conditions bear that out.I am used to sometimes opaque mouse setup software with other brands, but the GG software takes the cake.  I fell into a deep time sink when I discovered that the custom profile color setups that I had created for my mouse (Basic Desktop and Gaming) worked no more and only the default color scheme was operational.After much sturm and drang, I finally figured out that in the “Prism” color facility within GG if you simply click the box acknowledging the existence of your particular mouse, as one will do, that it then overrides whatever configuration color setups you created in the “Gear” setup facility and only the default setup can be used.  Evidently, there are two color setup facilities within GG, and they do not cooperate.

    This mouse has a defective scroll wheel controller , apparently a common problem according to the forums.  It randomly doesn't register the wheel while scrolling or randomly registers  in the opposite direction.  I had to disable smooth scrolling altogether  in order to have any kind of response from the wheel.  As long as you do not rely on the scroll wheel the rest of the mouse is quite alright, light and responsive.  And the flick switch is really useful in MMO and RPG style games.  I do like the feel of the mouse, and have been using it for over a year now.  It would be damn near perfect if they can fix the scroll wheel.Another problem with this mouse is the non existent  Linux support.  Which requires me to use third party hacks to be able to access the button and RGB  lighting profiles.  However the mouse does have onboard memory and so I am able to reuse my button profile across multiple operating systems.  A custom RGB lighting scheme  still requires background software to run, which I really do not like.

    So the only things that I cant complain about is that this mouse looks beautiful and is super lightweight. But, that is where the good stuff stops. My mouse's scroll wheel is completely broken. It will scroll up randomly while I scroll down and vise versa so, in videogames, I can never select the right item with the scroll wheel. The wireless capabilities stopped working almost completely about a year into use also (which is why I am writing this review) . I am a bit disappointed this happened because this mouse really looks good and is super lightweight. Another minor thing is that it isn't the most comfortable mouse to hold. I have had a bit better but man, kinda sad it sucks. Not recommended.

    Sturdy, like the texture feel, large gliders, excellent weight and button response.  I moved from the Glorious model O and D, these are good mice but the left click was not always positive.  The left click on this Aerox 5 is superior, precise, and 100% responsive.  I like the extra programable buttons, their placement taking some getting used to, but work very well.  The less gaudy RGB is appreciated, as is the curser accelleration/decelleration in software, but the best thing is the PRECISE button feel/response of all the switches!!!  They should make a slightly smaller version.

    It’s a great mouse in every way. Love the dual connectivity, only issue is the clutch, DPI shift thumb button on the side is slightly too far forward and requires a small hand position adjustment to reach. I have large hands too so I was surprised. All else aside it’s a great mouse.

    Don't let my headline confuse you, I love this mouse! I just feel like most tech that it's priced WAY higher than what it's probably worth. Buuut! Other than the high price tag I gotta say that there's nothing not to like about it! It's lightweight, very responsive, NO rubber grips and it has a very accessible set of side buttons! On the thought of the side buttons I mentioned in my headline that the mouse is unique. Now what makes it unique? The um... Flipper(???) side button! Just above the two standard side buttons is a single button or switch that you can flick up or down for separate actions! This is freaking awesome for anyone that wants more key-binds on their mouse without speckling said mouse with a ton of tiny buttons.
