"1","Flgocexs Wireless Carplay Adapter - 3 in 1 Wireless Carplay and Android Auto Adapter with Built in Netflix YouTube Support TF Card Only for Original Car Models After 2016 with Wired Carplay","PeterJ","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2024","I recently purchased the Wireless Carplay Adapter • 3 in 1 for my Honda Odyssey 2024, and I must say, the setup was a breeze. It connected automatically without any hassle, making the installation process a joy.While there is a slight half-second delay in touch response, it's important to note that this is likely due to Bluetooth connectivity. However, it's something one can easily adapt to over time. Despite this minor inconvenience, the overall performance of the Carplay adapter is commendable.What truly sets this adapter apart is the ability to enjoy YouTube and Netflix directly on the car's radio screen. This feature alone makes it a worthwhile investment, enhancing the overall driving experience. The convenience and pleasure of having these entertainment options at your fingertips during journeys are truly remarkable.In conclusion, the Wireless Carplay Adapter • 3 in 1 is a good investment that brings a lot of value to your driving experience. The slight touch delay is a minor trade-off for the convenience and enjoyment it provides. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend it to others looking to enhance their in-car entertainment system."

"6","Flgocexs Wireless Carplay Adapter - 3 in 1 Wireless Carplay and Android Auto Adapter with Built in Netflix YouTube Support TF Card Only for Original Car Models After 2016 with Wired Carplay","Shopper","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2024","Connection: 4/10Audio/Video Playback: 6/10There is an obvious delay in playback during both music and video streaming, which understandably can be expected. Additionally, it takes approximately 2-3 minutes to connect CarPlay to my phone, on top of  manually having to connect to my phone's hotspot through the settings before accessing Netflix/Youtube which will advise there is no internet connection. Another issue noticed is that even after the vehicle is turned off, if close by, the audio tries to connect through CarPlay, so I have to manually disconnect it, otherwise, it just reconnects a call back to it. However, apart from these issues, the playback and all other features work fine."

It was easy to install and the directions were very easy to follow. I use it everyday in my new car. It is easier than plugging in a USB to connect to CarPlay. The only reason I have it a 4 star review is because sometimes it doesn’t want to connect to my phone but after a few minutes of driving it ends up connecting."

"11","Flgocexs Wireless Carplay Adapter - 3 in 1 Wireless Carplay and Android Auto Adapter with Built in Netflix YouTube Support TF Card Only for Original Car Models After 2016 with Wired Carplay","A Traveler","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2023","...so far, it works! I'm using it in my 2022 Subaru Outback. It was easy to hook up. First I plugged it directly into the port, but then I found I like using one of the included cables so I can park the dongle in the slim pocket on the passenger side of the dash.Performance-wise, there's a delay in connecting when I restart the car, but not terrible. Skipping to the next song is a delay of maybe a second. It's dropped the connection once in mid-session--I'll be watching to see if that happens again. And, although very minor to me, in the interest of thorough reporting I'll add that mine doesn't have a blue light like the photos.I've used it for only a day but already find it a completely necessary gadget. Great to be cord-free!"
