"1","Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled — wired or wire-free (Black)","William Morgan","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2024","ALL of the Blink stuff I have ordered is getting this same review.  After doing an insane amount of research for a home security camera system I settled on Blink for ease of set up and cost.  In both of those areas there really isn't a close second.  As far as reliability, I'll check in again in a year or two--but other reviews indicate reliability is good.  So, good news: easy set-up, great prices, video quality is as good as any, motion sensors and other software adjustable stuff is easy to understand and do.Bad news:  The system is crazy slow.  I knew that going in, so it might be a bigger deal to you.  I'm willing to live with it mostly--down the road I plan to put in a much faster, wired, real time system with only one or two cameras, and Blink has a new ""Sync Module"" that is supposed to have greater range--and maybe speed things up a bit.  The slow is annoying...but not a deal breaker.It has notified me of low batteries a few times--so now I just let it go and they seem to recover on their own.  I've also had one or two go offline and I had to reinstall them.  I think there are two factors causing this, and again for the price I am willing to live with it.  For one thing I have the wireless range maxed out even with an extender for my WiFi network.  The other factor is it is currently the dead of Winter and cold beyond all reason.  9 degrees last night, high is 31 today.  Lots of snow and wind, too.  I'm harder to get along with in this weather myself, so I'll put up with some additional problems with electronics that live outside.Bottom line?  After three months I'm happy with it and I recommend any and all of the parts of the system I've bought.  It works as advertised and it's way cheap--including the annual subscription if you want cloud storage.  I will be buying a couple more pieces soon.  It is fully functional as long as you don't need a lot of speed.  I'm talking about minutes when I’m antsy and want seconds."
"2","Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled — wired or wire-free (Black)","Jessie Doan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2024","“Change previous review to a strong 5.” KEVIN from Blink customer service reached out to me and after doing diagnostics on his end, it was determined that the camera was faulty. He immediately sent me a new doorbell which is now working great with my other 5 blink cameras. Can’t ask for more than that.Stopped working after couple months. Now Will not add to app. Have tried every fix there is on internet for many hours. On a whim I deleted and reinstalled another blink camera. Installed just fine, so I know my home system is working. Tried to return to amazon but apparently only have one month. Warranty says a year. Have 5 other blink cameras around house. So disappointed. Thought Amazon would stand behind their product."
"3","Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled — wired or wire-free (Black)","happy","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2023","Actually the temporary cloud you get when you first turn it on is not bad. The ongoing fees if you want to keep it are above average. You can DIY it by using a synch module - which you really have to have anyway, a usb power block, a usb cord and a usb drive. All of this clips into a cheesy holder and the whole thing plugs into a socket. Elegant design it is not. It occupies about 6 inches high by 4 wide and 4 deep of wall space. A strong cockroach can knock it out of the socket. But, it does store your clips  at home and you can pull the drive and send it to whatever cloud you have via laptop or desktop. The video bell is easy to install with 2 screws. Setup is just shoot a pic of the QR, and give it a name. It will not make any notification inside! Buy ( are you getting the idea blink is a kluge ? ) one from many retailers or use Alexa ( guess what kids you must buy this too) , for which there is a skill and multiple chime sounds. [ or hardwire to your old school doorbell chime I may do this when it stops snowing. Wait, I live in FL, no snow, I am never going to do this]. The picture is fine although 1k rather than the latest  2k.  If you wait a bit you can see it on your phone, though I find Alexa faster. There was supposed to be a one button push for iphone and android notification so you do not have to unlock phone, start app and click on view. I have not found it yet. Batteries. Yes you need them and they are why I bought this ( already having a blink setup). My old doorbell non blink cams use 18650 which need charging every 3 months or so and die between 2-3 years & require the most expensive $20 a pair 18650s. And I was not about to install doorbell transformer, wire and chimes which allow running on 12-26 volts AC but this is an option. My other blinks have run since 2021 without the bother of recharge on AA lithiums as does this. The AAs cost $20 a pair. I am happy. The voice com for you and visitor is clear, nightime view ok, you will recognize your Mom. Motion detection works well. Hey Amazon, Alexa, Blink we all know you are the same corp. - make the synch module a neat desktop saucer shape thing with cord and plug or even cord and power block. That wall wart thing is nasty. Guess what ? You can even add micro usb storage. Guess what what? Put the $%*& thing inside next gen echo view). One star off because Prime delivery guy would not install it. ( actually guys thanks for walking up that 2 story ramp to house every time I buy something).Update: Customer service. Wanted to have doorbell image come up automatically on bell push. Found a couple of u tubes on how to implement but due to poor eysight and worse hearing could not implement. Tried cust support. Asked me to allow them access to setup to help arrange. Did so, then got new rep telling me  She, was taking over. Well 17 emails back and forth it  ( it had to have been an IT bot calling itself Jen, paid no attention to anything I said) blew me off saying it could not be done but what a great idea would let the IT guys know. Right. See google for proof it can be done. Zero for you Jen and blink cust svc. Update: blink vust service emailed again and asked for third time what I wanted. Repeated whole thing and refered them to 3 videos showing what they said could not be done, could be done. They responded by sending me links on how to set up alexa. As I have bern using alexa for 3 years this was of course useless, as apparently is blink support."
"4","Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled — wired or wire-free (Black)","Techsavy96","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2024","Have wanted a video doorbell for a long time!  Can’t hear when someone knocks at the front door. Did a lot of research and came to the conclusion that Blink was a good one. Was super easy to get set up. Runs on battery power(AA’s) or can run on existing door chime wiring. Either way needs batteries. Great quality and sound is crisp and clear.  With the Sync module. You are able to connect a usb for local storage. Love it!  Looking forward to buying some security cameras for this system!!"
"5","Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled — wired or wire-free (Black)","LeighAnn ","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2024","Kevin with Blink contacted me quickly after posting my initial review. He reviewed everything and promptly sent a new doorbell! I’m very happy with the customer service and thrilled to have a doorbell installed and working great.The blink doorbell worked for a few days, then stopped. We had purchased cameras and the sync 2 to accompany the doorbell as well. We have tried every troubleshooting recommendation to no avail. Finally sent an email to blink customer support a week ago-no response. I’m not sure what to do? I’m hoping this review will stir up some help. We really need this doorbell to work!"
"6","Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled — wired or wire-free (Black)","Richard R. Walkup","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2024","I have never such an indebt review, but I spent a whole year going through doorbells. I will start from the beginning of my experience. I will list the 3 main doorbells I bought, Why I bought them, what I didn't like about them and why I returned them and the refund process.This is what I was looking for in a doorbell. Also, I learned through out the process what was more important for my needs. It needed to be Wireless for easy insulation. Good night vision. Good AI detection, a separate chime for indoor, remote monitoring, a long lasting battery, Elderly friendly & easy to use, and one of the most important needs were budget. I didn't want to spend a big amount on the doorbell, Then, spend money on a app, cloud subscription, separate chime, & Alexa. I was buying these for my grandparents. They do not understand having subscriptions for everything nowadays, but has to be easy to understand and use.EKEN wireless doorbell and Chime; Bought on February 13, 2023. The reasons I bought it were, said it was free and no subscription, indoor chime, and the price. After buying this one I really learned what was important and if things seem to good to be true they probably are, duh right. First off, the app is free to downloads but is not free after that. There is a monthly app fee and cloud storage free. Also, the app is a Chinese app. its complicating and not user friendly. I got notifications every time a car went by. it was annoying. I only could see the street. It didn't show any of my drive but the very end. Only worked with 2.4 Wi-Fi. You could only have one indoor chime connected and it was not loud enough. One of my most annoying facts about this doorbell was I had to charge it every week! I live in rural area and I couldn't imagine how soon I would have to charge living in the city.  I returned EKEN on September 19, 2023 because it quit working. It would no longer connect to the internet or the chime. it was frozen for weeks. In the end I'm glad it gave out because it was really more of a nightmare and not free like they say! I paid $46 for this doorbell.Blink Wired/Wireless Doorbell; Bought on July 31, 2023. I really had high hopes for this one. This one was the most misleading, very vague information, and the hardest to get a refund on. This is not a wireless Doorbell. For it to really work with out an Alexa, google home or some kind of in home system you have to wire it. There is no indoor Chime. You are not told about  Sync Module when buying. The app is free but cloud storage is not and you need locally storage with the Sync Module 2 and USB drive (each sold separately). I was not aware of this when I bought it. However, with out an Alexa I couldn't even get it set up and use it and get the local storage later. I thought we could use the app like every other doorbell but with out the Alexa you will get no notifications. It doesn't say when I returned it, but I remember them telling me after a non-pleasant- conversation to keep the product and we will refund you. If you are wondering... no, you can not take it home and hook it up to your Alexa. they disable it unfortunately , . I paid $60 for this.Eufy Security, Battery Video Doorbell C210 Kit, Wi-Fi Connectivity, 1080p, 120-Day Battery, No Subscription, AI Detection, Wireless Chime Included, 2-Way Audio, Remote Monitoring for Apartment Living; Bought on November 5, 2023. I waited till the doorbell died for the first time to write the review. after the first one it was really important to me for it to have a reasonable length in a battery! I charged it for the first time for a good amount of time. The first's charge is always the most important on any battery powered electronics. It died on 2/15/24. The battery lasted 100 days with moderately amount of use. I am very happy with it. It does not take long to charge back up either. I am not getting a notification every time a car goes by either. The AI in the doorbell works really well on telling me when someone is here or when there is activity. Great night vision. One of my Favorite is it came with a free angle piece! so I see my whole driveway and street. The house is a normal ranch house so the driveway is 'normally' placed  none of the other doorbells came with a angle piece and the insulation looks great. There is a piece it snaps in-to, so, no thief can run off with it and protects it from water. Moreover, ITs free! The app is free and the chime is also a storage device! The chime is loud and has more then one chime. I did have to buy a memory card for the storage. In the reviews I read it said It has to be SanDisk 128GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter - 120MB/s, C10, U1, Full HD, A1, Micro SD Card - SDSQUA4-128G-GN6MA. You can have a lower GB but nothing higher then 128GB. I have had no problems with it  its just a basic memory card but works great with doorbell. I have had no problems with doorbell or local storage and chime. The app is super elderly friendly and easy to use. the company brags about being budget friendly. Eufy says, ""No Subscription Required: Designed to protect your home as well as your wallet, Eufy security products are one-time purchases that combine security with convenience."" I have no complaints with this product. I had to spend more money with this one but because I don't have to pay for a subscription, app fee, and cloud storage (storage is after the moment of doorbell going off being able to see it) I paid $99.99 with a $20 coupon. The memory card was $13.88. With doorbell and everything included, memory card, and coupon & tax; I paid $100.91.I Know this a long review, but if I could save someone a year of wasting time on doorbells I hope I can help!"
"7","Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled — wired or wire-free (Black)","4 Lil Lambs","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2023","I was initially looking at another brand because they had a wireless video doorbell that came with its own chime.  My home was built in 1897 and I don't have existing doorbell wiring or chime in the house.  So wireless doorbell that came with a chime was the way I wanted to go.  Only problem, this other brand didn't offer all the options and/or configurations I was hoping for.Then I was introduced to Blink.  It had all the options I needed.  Granted it doesn't have its own chime, BUT....you can use the mini or Alexa as your indoor chime.  Perfect!  Had the corner mount so I could point the video doorbell camera towards the entrance to the porch.  Again, old home on a corner with a wrap around porch where the entrance to the porch was on the corner and the door was at the end of one side.  Does me no good to have the camera pointing straight ahead into the front yard.  You can mix and match all of the devices to get the optimum setup for your needs, and they all connect seamlessly.Then I started doing my research on Blink.  Reading the reviews from customers really made me question if I should buy.  Too difficult to install.  Too difficult to set up.  Can't connect to Alexa.  Battery life a fraction of what they claim.  Cameras always disconnecting.  I'm glad I ignored the reviews, chalking up the technology issues to people just not being tech savvy.  I was right.Installation was extremely simple.  Not a fan of the online instructions instead of a booklet, but I managed.Sync Module, video doorbell, 3 outdoor cameras and 1 mini indoor camera connected to the Blink system with no issues.Connecting to Alexa was equally as flawless.  Set up the Blink skill in Alexa and ""she"" immediately found all the Blink devices. Our Echo in the living room, Echo Dot in the bedroom and the indoor mini will all serve as chimes wherever we are in the house.  The Echo devices will also announce any motion detection.  We can arm and disarm the system by voice command with Alexa.  Disarm does require a voice pin code which you have to set up in the Alexa app.Setting up and managing the devices in the blink app is fairly intuitive and straight forward.  You can adjust the motion sensitivity, set up privacy and no detection zones.  After setting up the doorbell out of the box, we would get random motion detection notifications.  After checking the clips, it had to be either vehicles passing in the street facing the door, or a flag flapping in the wind at the end of the porch where the steps are.  I shut off motion detection in the street, lowered the sensitivity slightly, but  left the flag area on, and no more false detection's.  So it was definitely not the flag tripping it.  Camera still picks up people as they come to the top of the steps and alerts us.Video quality is pretty decent.  I'm please so far.  Haven't been able to test what the night video looks like, or the two way voice at the doorbell  yet.  Once I am able to and if there are any real issues, I will edit my review.As far as battery life, it's too early to tell.  All the documentation I have read indicates that with the sync module and turning off settings or features you don't really need will extend the battery life to the 2 years claimed.  Time will tell.If I had a complaint so far, it's the fact that the time it takes from notification until a live view of the camera finally comes up in the app, the person tripping the motion detection has dropped off the package and left.  That timing needs reduced greatly."
"8","Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled — wired or wire-free (Black)","Roland MJ Ziemke","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2022","We bought 2 of these - because our house didn't have working doorbells ... and we couldn't hear people at the door.  And that was a problem.We got them activated, then it took a little while before we could get them installed.  I think we missed our 2 week free trial entirely.  But, it takes a while to get things done while unpacking.The day we put them up, we lost internet for 3 days.  They don't work without internet.Finally, we had them up and running.They are S L O W  .... I watched the mailman ring the doorbell ... set down the packages ... and leave.  As the truck was driving away, my phone chimed ... about 20 seconds.My son has enjoyed them.  He can talk with me from the garage door or front door.  I can open the Blink app to watch the live video.  My husband even gets the doorbell while he is driving around town.Maybe we need to get the services that go with these ... I didn't think about extra monthly charges when I ordered them.... service is by Blink, a company of Amazon.My ""Show"" doesn't seem to be able to connect to the devices .. one of the big reasons that we chose Blink doorbells is so we could see them from our Show devices.Overall, not impressed.I've never gotten the motion detection to work.  Night vision has not been tested.But since they are fully installed, I'm not removing them to send them back.Update after nearly 3 months:Great:You can talk to people IF you open the app.  But having the app open all the time is hard on your phone batteries.Easy to installWe are still on the first batteries, and the front gets a lot of traffic.It is easy to pause them if you plan to work near the camera range to avoid constant notifications.  (ONCE you know where to find it on the app)If your app is working.  It can be fun to scare the kids working near the camera... ""I see you!""  Ahem.  It can be great tool to talk to the person at the door.  Especially if you don't want to open the door.The range of vision is HUGE.  The resolution is great.  You can usually get good details.The Ugly:The delay is so long, that people sometimes walk away before you know that they arrived.  They hear the bell.  You hear it 10 to 20 seconds later IF you have sound up on your phone.No matter how hard I've tried, it doesn't really interact with my Echo Show.  That connection seems to do nothing.  I expected it to act like an indoor doorbell, and then show me the  camera view.  I expect my dots to chime.  But nothing happens.Images only show on the app cloud storage.  You can buy a device to store data at home.  But I wish I could view the picture from the doorbell 2 minutes later when I get the notification!Which leads to ... you HAVE to get that subscription if you want this to function as a camera.NEED TO IMPROVE:They need a dedicated box you can mount inside the house that has a loud CHIME when the doorbell is pushed.  OR  get this feature to work with your dedicated Alexia devices.  Doorbell is pretty worthless if the only person who hears it is the person who pushed the doorbell.  .... Yeah, it chimes OUTSIDE!Need to be able to pull open the app and activate the camera to see outside on demand (like I do with the Blink mini cameras)."
"9","Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled — wired or wire-free (Black)","team W","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2024","I first bought this in October of 2021 and my impression was, ""it's good enough for the price."" I've had two years and quite a story to tell, so get comfy. The short version is that I'd definitely recommend it, especially if Ring is a little too rich for your blood, but there are some caveats to be aware of.The first complaint I had with it was the sync module that it came with for storing the video clips. Put simply, there's really no using this without the subscription plan. Blink had told me the doorbell will sync with the module without a plan, but I never got that to work properly. I'm not mad; if I wanted a standalone, cloud-free solution, I had a myriad of other options besides Blink. Just be aware you should get a plan for it. It's a service first, a product second, if you follow. Something else to be aware of before we move on is to keep that little tool they include with it for dismounting the doorbell from the bracket. You can still remove the doorbell without it using a small screwdriver, but it's a pain. Whatever helps you hold onto that little metal key, go for it.My second complaint was the ""motion zones"" feature where you set blind spots so it doesn't get set off by every passing car. Trouble is, this never worked. I just resigned myself to scrubbing the clips everyday of anything that wasn't someone coming to the door and/or ringing the doorbell (the clips automatically erase after a set period of time, so you could simply wait it out rather than taking my proactive approach). What did work in this menu was the privacy zone. It's like the motion zones, only it puts a gray box over a designated area that's ""baked in"" to the video. The way I had the doorbell positioned, it was possible to see the keypad to my door. I didn't like the idea of that info being on the cloud, so I grayed it out.My third complaint is the most important one: fogging. This thing fogged up at the slightest drizzle. It would clear up with the sunshine, so I didn't think much of it. About a year and a half goes by and not only did it fog up again, but it stayed fogged up. I took a look at it and found the fog was on the inside. It looked like a mineral build up. This left a big, fuzzy blind spot in the center of the video, which rendered it almost useless. Faces were clear so long as they stood close enough to the door, but this was hardly ideal. I couldn't find any teardowns or anything that would help me get inside the camera and treat the lens from the inside, so I simply dealt with it, keeping my eyes open for other options.In December of 2023, I got another doorbell on sale for about half off. My thought was I'd pop the old doorbell off its mount and put the new one in its place, relegating the foggy one to another door (better than nothing). Trouble is, in the two years since I bought that first doorbell, Blink made improvements to the design. For starters, the batteries are no longer exposed. They're behind a panel and in fact I couldn't see any exposed circuitry like on the old one. I guess enough people had complained about the fogging for them to do something about it, though it remains to be seen if this one will have the same fogging problem (it's only been installed for about a week as of this writing). Unfortunately, this redesign meant I couldn't use the old mount, which angled the doorbell about 30 degrees so its field of view would encompass the whole porch. My solution was to move the doorbell to the opposite side of the door since it was closer to the knob and you could still see the stairs and walkway leading up to the door.As for value, I'm happy to say it's reached a point where, as far as I care,  it's paid for itself. Even if I had paid full price for the second doorbell, it would be worth the peace of mind. I caught a porch pirate. The whole reason we got the doorbell in the first place 2 years ago was because our neighbors had the car broken into. All was quiet thereafter, until a few days ago when a package arrived from Amazon. I got a notification while I was on break at work, so I scrolled through the clips and there they were pinching my package in broad daylight.I won't share the screencaps, but I caught this person red-handed walking (awkwardly) up to my front stairs, leaning over, grabbing the package, and walking away. I got three whole clips of their vehicle as well, a very conspicuous looking red coupe with mismatched orange body panels. I downloaded the clips to my iPad, went to the Police station a few blocks away, gave them all the pertinent details, and showed them the clips. The officer asked me to email it to him, and informed me that they might know the suspect. Apparently, they'd gotten some reports of suspicious activity, but couldn't prove anything had been stolen. I'm still waiting to hear back from the officer, but hopefully justice has been served. If anything, I hope the thief found a good use for the parchment and foil pans."
"10","Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled — wired or wire-free (Black)",NA,"4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2022","I am a long-time user of Blink, meaning I am in the ""grandfathered"" set of customers with free, limited cloud storage for video.  Overall, I think if you are already a Blink customer, this is a good addition to your system.Install: I needed one of those ""wedges"" that turns the camera to face out and using that, the install was pretty simple.  I agree with the people that noted that the back plate it comes with (which you still use when installing the wedge) is a little cheap and janky.  But the wedge is more sturdy and the resulting install is probably a little bit more solid and better than if I had just mounted the flat plate to the wall.You do need a good sized piece of flat wood to screw everything into.  This is not going to mount well to raw siding, curved trim pieces around doors etc.  You'd have to attach a small board to the surface of anything like that and then mount it to that board.Power vs. batteries:  I have one of those wired doorbells that is old-school, with the metal strikers that hit little chimes, not a digital doorbell.  This apparently matters because you need more power and a slightly larger transformer to drive one of those doorbells.  In turn, that means the transformer has enough power to power the blink doorbell.  If you have a digital doorbell you may (or may not) need to rely on the battery for the cameras.  It all depends on how big the transformer for your existing, wired doorbell is.  During the setup it asks you what kind of doorbell you have, and has a fairly sophisticated set of settings to make sure that when it sends a signal to the physical doorbell it is sending the correct amount of power to strike the chimes correctly.Set-up: Very easy and painless, almost exactly the same as setting up a regular blink camera.  Put in the batteries, scan the QR code, it finds the camera, links it to your existing system/sync module and you are ready to go.Motion Sensor: If you are already pretty familiar with Blink cameras, you know they can come with one of two kinds of sensors to detect motion.  Camera based sensors that just detect changes in the picture and more traditional sensors that only detect actual, physical movement.  The cheaper Blink mini only has a camera based sensor, while the more expensive units only detect actual physical movement with a dedicated motion sensor.  Both kinds of sensors can be triggered falsely by something like blowing leaves, but the camera-based sensors cannot distinguish changes in shadows and light from actual movement and so they have much higher rates of false detection.  Unfortunately, the blink doorbell appears to only have the cheaper detector that can be fooled by changes in light.  It does, however, have a more sophisticated, narrower grid of zones you can exclude from movement than the older Blink mini.  How much this matters to you is going to depend on where you plan to stick the camera - if you point your doorbell camera directly at a busy road and don't lock out the parts of the image that covers the road, you will get constant alerts from every car that goes by, or every person walking on the sidewalk, etc.  So think carefully about where the camera will sit and whether you want one of those wedges to tilt the direction of the thing to keep the camera aimed only at places where you actually want it to detect motion.Video quality: Very good, with a wide angle, almost fish-eye lens, so you get very good broad coverage of the area you are pointing the camera at.  There is also a microphone that records sound while you are recording video and it seems to work ok as well.  In theory you can use the thing to have a two-way conversation with whoever is at the door, but I haven't tried that yet.  I am, overall, very happy with the camera quality for the price here.Sound Chime/notifications:  When you push the doorbell, a chime inside the module itself goes off.  It is reasonably loud and lets the person ringing the doorbell know they definitely rang it.  The light on the button also lights up briefly to confirm the chime was pressed.  Would you, sitting inside the house, hear the chime the doorbell makes outside?  Probably, if you are in a small, quiet house.  Would you hear it  down in the basement of a large house with the TV or music on?  Absolutely not.  So if you are not hooking this up to an existing doorbell with a properly loud internal chime, then you will want to have it hooked up to your Alexa.  I don't use Alexa so didn't test that feature.  You do get a notification on your phone, when somebody rings the bell,  but I think most people will want either a hard wired connection or an Alexa connected to this thing to make sure they always hear the doorbell.What don't I like?I wish it had the same motion detection sensors as the larger blink cameras.  I would have paid more to get that.  Because it uses the camera to sense motion there are places where it really won't give good results.  So think very carefully about where you will place this, how often the wind will blow trees and create moving shadows within the motion detection zone, etc.It is annoying that even when the device is hard-wired, the light around the doorbell button isn't constantly lit.  Just as if it were only running on batteries, it only lights up when you press the button.  Not a huge deal in my installation, but if you don't have a porch light on, your doorbell will not be obvious to visitors.  It is particularly odd that they put a red LED into the thing which apparently has no purpose other than in the initial setup.  The design would be much better if the lighted ring around the button was always lit and then it flashed or turned red when you pressed it.  It appears all of the hardware necessary to do that is in the device, but it is not programmed that way.  I get that when the device isn't hardwired you don't want the button lit, but when it is powered it really should be lit in the dark.For $50, this thing is ok.  If you get it on sale, then it is a good deal, at least if you are an existing Blink customer.I am surprised that they killed off the little bit of free cloud storage for new customers.  That can't cost very much to provide these days and it was the key differentiator between Blink and some of these other companies that provide more elaborate, high-priced options.  Blink's claim to fame is that it works well enough and is cheap.  But if you have to pay a bunch of money for cloud storage no matter what, I would probably look at the more expensive options vs. Blink.  It stops being a compelling value once you start having to pay for video storage."

If you are like me you are a happy existing Blink Camera user who is thinking about adding the door bell to your existing setup. I had a blink camera setup aiming at my front door so at first I was not too sure that I really needed the door bell.  However for the cost I am very glad I got one.  There are a couple of things to know:(1) If you are an existing Blink customer, you do not need a second sync module.  All you need is the door bell and you can simple add it to your existing account (as easy as adding an additional camera).(2) If you are planning on hardwiring the blink doorbell to your existing doorbells wires. . . . you still have to use 2 AA batteries to power the camera.  This did not make sense to me as I figured my hardwires would power it, but sure enough after calling Blink support I realized I needed to put the AA batteries in the camera.  The hard wire will allow your blink doorbell to ring the doorbell in your home but will not power the camera.(3) You can turn on motion detection or just have the blink door bell turn on when the door bell is rung.  This is a nice feature.  If you want to catch anyone that comes to your door (whether they ring the bell or not, you can simple turn this feature on in the app).  If you want to save battery life and are only interested in door bell ringers you can turn motion detection off.(4) It has two way audio, meaning you will always hear the person at your door. . . . but you can also choose to speak to the person if you choose.  For me the audio the person at the door hears comes across a little staticky, but that could be my phone or the fact that I am using the corner mount.(5) It has more of a fish bowl view so it catches a wide view (meaning it can cover most of your front porch)(6) There is no additional cost to having the Blink doorbell or camera system.  Unlike other door bell systems out there, there is no additional cost to the Blink Doorbell.  The app is free, cloud storage is free, downloading images or videos is free, etc.If you are looking to set it up with just batteries and no wiring to an existing doorbell system, setup is a breeze (will take two minutes).  If you are looking to hard wire it, it is still pretty easy.  I am not a handy man and what I know about electricity will shock you (get my joke) but even I was able to hard wire it.  Get the doorbell, you will be glad you did.  Hope this review helped."

I also discovered you can have Echo Show or Echo Dot be your chime so again if you understand Alexa routines,  and you have alexa devices,  you will never have an issue hearing when someone rings your blink Doorbell,  don't forget to link your Blink app and the Alexa app to ensure the above things work for you,  okay on to issue I can't find a work around,  Blinks idea of battery life reminds me of auto manufacturers MPG  estimates,  we all know in the real world it's not going to happen,  sure,  if you dial down all the features,  you might get half of what Blink says,  but then I ask you,  why have it,  we buy them to use them right  ?, so I have found average battery life even using the suggested energizer ultimate lithium,  is about 6 months,  not 2 years  and don't care how they or their paid reviewers try to spin it,  it's not going to happen even if you dial all the features down,  making it a waste of money,  and yes I'm using the sync module which is supposed to help battery life,  maybe it does,  can't answer that but real life,  no B.S. spinning,  your not going to come close to their battery projections,  my only work around for that is the batteries are easy to change and I understand and can deal with this,  Speaking of the Blink module,  I use it for local storage and I also use the pay for cloud storage,  that's another non work around issue,  far far to many features are LOCKED OUT,  if you don't pay for the Blink subscription,  Now if you don't care about saving videos and you just want to know who is at your door regardless if you are home or away,  this will alert you,  it will display to you video of who and allow you to talk to them also and I must say it does a good job at it and you don't need the blink subscription and if you do have the Blink module and a usb stick in, it will save those for you,  at short lengths,  but it will do it.  Overall it is a good security device,  and although obviously it is far from the better ones.  From a pure value Perspective I would highly recommend this,  , easy to install,  no wires,  pretty much can put it where you want it,  Again it does everything pretty well,  One of the best prices out there,  just understand it has shortcomings,  but also understand it's price,  and it will certainly do the job for you,  this isn't a trashing review,  I  tried my hardest to be real and actually recommend it,  it just doesn't function at the upper levels of some of the others,  but it doesn't have the upper price tag , plus I am actually going to buy another,  remember,  you can put them about anywhere,  I actually have one stashed at the front of my house,  not by the door,  it gives me a full frontal view of my home when I am away,  sure it is a Doorbell but it is a camera as well and at this nice price why not,  weather elements have not hurt mine a bit in the 13 months I have had them,  including the one not by the door and pretty open to rain,  snow and cold,  it has held up well,  still ticking,  no signs of wear,  so another plus"
"13","Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled — wired or wire-free (Black)","Gump","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2023","Originally we purchased a Ring doorbell which I loved initially until I realized it was stuck downloading firmware. Dealing with Ring support I cut my losses and got this doorbell from Blink. Quite literally 1/5th the price of the Ring.The Blink doorbell nearly fit in the same location which was nice. Now I only have a small hole where the Ring unit was. This doorbell only has 2 screw holes for securing it to the house, less than ideal but still, secure enough. It is able to be wired into a regular doorbell transformer so I have it on ac power. I'm not sure if it was meant to be able to ring an indoor ringer but I couldn't get it to work, but also suspect the old indoor doorbell isn't functional. It came with the house that was built in 86 so I wasn't hung up on that working.However... This doorbell doesn't come with a ringer, not really. It will ring OUTSIDE, the unit itself will chime, you will NEVER HEAR IT inside your house. I mean I supposed it's possible if you live in a tent. Blink has some indoor cams that will double as wireless door chimes, get a set, call it a day, you won't be disappointed.Supposedly you can get Alexa to squack when someone rings the door bell also, don't count on that working consistently, it's a nice thought, dare to dream right? We have 8 Alexa devices throughout the house and maybe 1 in 10 doorbell rings will also ring on the Alexa devices. The Blink indoor cams, chime every time so again, that's the best solution.The doorbell also comes with a wedge if I remember correctly, for turning the doorbell from being buried in a corner to face into your entry way a bit more, but if there is siding or something that faces your doorbell towards the sky or something like that you'll have to figure out a way to aim it more directly at visitors. I ultimately removed a swatch of siding to mount the doorbell flush against the house and that was the best solution and viewing angle.Overall, video picture isn't bad, motion detection is a bit sensitive, but still tweaking that. For the money you can forgive a lot of this doorbells short comings. None of them are deal breakers, but there are little things that you don't know about till you get your hands on one.I will say this, research your purchase, if you already have Ring, stick with Ring, in order for most of these smart cams and doorbells to save videos, you have to subscribe to Blink, or Ring or whatever for their cloud storage. Typically it's $4 per single device or $10 for unlimited devices, per month. Originally I thought I had read that Blink would allow 7200 seconds for video storage in their cloud without a subscription. Yes that is correct but ONLY if you have what they call a legacy or grandfathered account. So if this is your first Blink device, and you want clip storage in the cloud, you will have to get the basic sub for that. If you have other Blink devices and a hub with USB flash memory storage, you can live without the sub. The nice thing about the cloud storage is you can manipulate your saved clips much easier than if you just have the hub and USB storage. It's a toss up depending on how much convenience you want. Just know that if you can't live without the cloud storage option, you will be paying for a sub for each brand (and apps for each to control them), there isn't anything out there that can combine them all into one. I didn't want to have Blink, and Ring, and ...? subs because that's getting expensive just to save clips so I opted to go with all Blink devices."

I like it & it was very easy to install. It comes with brackets for flat mount or angled mount. Unfortunately, because of where the doorbell had to be installed, it’s exposed to weather. There have been no issues with leaking, but the rain gets on the lens & obstructs the view. Now I’ll have to buy one of those hooded brackets & hopefully that will solve the problem. I’ll update this after I do that. The only issue I’ve really had with the doorbell camera is that the night vision leaves much to be desired. My other blink cameras have really good night vision, so I figured this would be the same, or at least comparable. The first time I checked it at night I thought it wasn’t working because it was totally black. It was working, but just has horrible night vision no matter which settings I use. If you have lights, it works great & the picture quality is actually better than the Outdoor 4 cameras I have. But if you don’t have lights, all you’ll see is black, until something goes in front of it. I’ve reached out to Blink, so I’ll update this after coming to a resolution or conclusion with them."

Installation and setup via the Sync 2 module were fairly easy and straightforward. Getting the doorbell to connect with Alexa was more challenging, and I’m still not really satisfied with the interface with Alexa. It does work better than the outdoor cameras, but it’s still only good, not great or excellent. One tip - the camera does not have as wide a field of view as you might think. I mounted this where our previous, non-camera doorbell was. The camera can pick up my wife’s face, but my 6’0” frame puts everything above my shoulders out of camera field of view. You will have to test carefully before you mount to make sure you are seeing all you want/need to see. Also, the doorbell camera shares a flaw with all other Blink cameras. It is very slow. From the moment you respond to a notification of a doorbell push or motion to the moment the screen on the app will show you who is there is at least a full two seconds. That may not seem so long but try for yourself and see what could be happening outside your door in that length of time. So, the plus is, it works and it is easy to setup. But it does have some drawbacks."

It looks good and modern on the door, and I feel like people instantly see it and are more cautious as they know everything can be recorded. It helps security in that way, and was fairly easy to install. I got a solar panel mount to put it in to avoid having to change the battery, and it's affixed quite firmly and nicely. It works well, and has a loud chime. The only issue is the delay. It may be the Wifi, but my Internet speeds are pretty high and still the chime only rings by the time someone has pressed it, turned and walked down the stairs. I appreciate I can hear the chime on the doorbell, my phone and the little camera I got bundled with it, which I have in my living room for a louder signal. But the delay is pretty vast if that's something that would bother you.And to get motion detection alerts, you'll have to sign up for the subscription. During the free trial, it seemed to work quite well, but since I have multiple security cameras, it didn't seem necessary to have that when I just needed a doorbell. For that purpose, Blink seems reliable and stylish, if slow. So it will depend on your needs if this is a good fit."

It is wireless so we rely on the lithium battery to operate. I had to change the batteries in Feb. So they lasted 2 months, which is fine with me, as I check it frequently when my dogs are outside in the yard and they are barking, or when I hear sounds after dark. They're are people walking up and down my street all night. My motion sensor lights come on and my Blink camera will notify me. There was a time when I wasn't home and had deliveries made, and also the city needed access to my yard to check something (which I was already expecting) so being able to speak with the city worker to give permission to proceed was valuable, otherwise we would have had to wait until another time."

Dumb.The install was easy, the setup did not tell me how to turn on doorbell push notifications, and it wasn’t anywhere obvious in the instructions.  I had to Google it. Dumb.The part that makes me want to throw it in the trash is that I can’t find any information on how to add someone to my account to give them doorbell access without giving them my password to everything in my Amazon acct.  Dumb and stupid.The doorbell so far is fine, great picture quality. I wish there was an icon for the doorbell push notification because it looks like all of the other notifications so it’s easy to glance and think it’s just a motion alert.Ugh. I’m sure I will survive the irritation and just be happy with better quality and cheaper price."

So for that effort in them wanting to help I give the company 5 stars. As for the product itself I give 3 stars because it picks up everything even a tree branch on a tree moving. I hate to see what will happen with my blink when a wind storm comes through. Last night it picked up a wolf coming through my yard. With Ring it only picked up people and packages which is what I want a video doorbell to do. I left Ring because of the price hike they did this year. They went from $30 to $49 a yr and I would have paid a small hike and counted it as inflation but that big of a hike and Im gone.I had made a negative feedback originally because I could not get my chime to work. Well I got a professional to come out and fix it and come to find out it was because I just mounted it to the wall and expected it to work but I did not know you also have to go through all the steps in the app to get the chime to work.

I believe I’ve have this for 2-3 months so I guess that pretty decent but!! The battery may not last that long if you are always peeping/talking through it at all or most times there is motion or if the setting are set to where it’ll drain the battery more. Anywho, the batteries were apparently low or dead. The doorbell wouldn’t record motion all the time and at a certain point it just stopped working. It was acting weird for about 2-3 days recording maybe 2/10 times there was motion but the app said it was online and the battery life was “ok”. It says “online” even though the camera was nkt operating at all. It wasn’t ringing when. I pressed the button nor was it detecting or recording anything. I thought something was wrong with it because the app didn’t reflect what the real issue was which was literally just dead or dying batteries apparently.You need the sync module 2($34.99 does not include storage you’ll have to buy a usb storage drive separately up to 256GB from what I believe to have read) if you want to be able to see live footage or speak live through the camera. You can do those things with the sync module 2 and the subscription.I don’t have a sync module 2 so I can only see recorded motion which it is triggered by motion or the doorbell being rang. No footage will be recorded w/o a sync module 2 and/or a subscription.You have to rang the doorbell after each time you click save in settings in order to put those new settings in place. So be prepared for that.Microphone makes a weird buzzing sound sometimes. I think after a few seconds of recording that’s when it kicks in. For the price of $29.99 w/ tax(I got it on sale it is showing it usually goes for $59.99), I can’t complain too much. This is one of the most affordable wireless doorbells out right now.I know it’s the norm now but a con to be is the subscription. Without a subscription you’re pretty limited on what you can do. You might as well not buy one unless you plan on getting that. $3 a month for 1 camera and $10 a month for 1 or more.Gotta have a sync module two for you to be able to hear the doorbell ring through the speakers on your other cameras if you have em.Does not always catch the motion. So far it’s been good with it but a good amount of times it didn’t record motion. One instant, my child was playing outside and ran passed it and the camera didn’t record him when he ran passed it again the opposite direction. He left his play area and the camera didn’t even record that. Luckily it’s in a pretty enclosed space but that camera made me think he was still playing in that area while the whole time he wasn’t. Of course check on your kiddos but don’t reply solely on this to detect motion in front of your door at all moments. They’re also gaps between recordings.Pros: comes with batteries, easy to set up, decent camera quality, very quick customer service(I can get ahold of someone in like 1-3 minutes). Decent camera quality even when night vision is activated. No issues with it going offline randomly like the blink mini cameras do. Small and easy to hide. Door ring has a notification that comes to your phone in the exact sound as the doorbell(phone can’t be on silent or of course you won’t hear it)."

I think the entire process took about 15-20 minutes from unboxing to up and running but I did choose the wireless method.Just follow the instructions after downloading the app (step by step) and you'll be fine.I'm sure that wired will take slightly longer but probably just a few minutes since it's just splicing two wires.  I would have gone with this but I don't have an existing wiring to work with and don't feel like doing it in the middle of winter.  Maybe when summer comes around...?You DO NOT need to have Alexa in order to use this since it can run off of your existing wifi.After getting it mounted and operational, you'll want to play with the motion sensitivity because although it claims to have a range of 25 feet, mine was detecting motion at well past that at around 60 feet with the sensitivity set to 6.  I eventually worked it down to 2 and now it's perfect for my preferences.My primary reason for getting this was because I have had a mail carrier just carelessly  tossing packages on the stairs up to my porch so that they are visible to all passers by and obvious for package thieves.  I was finally able to contact the postmaster with proof that this was happening along with a video and photo of the carrier who kept doing this.I don't know how the batteries will hold up but I don't consider that a concern since I always keep rechargeable AA and AAA batteries on hand for the various battery operated gadgets around the house.Video quality isn't perfect but it's more than enough to identify who is there.Audio is sufficient to communicate even with background noise/traffic.I like it enough to buy a second one for the back door."

It doesn’t show video. Can add it to the system, but can’t view video or create thumbnail. Easy to understand, correct?Today, 12/23/23, marks more than a whole week, of emails, phone calls, constant communication with absolutely NO results. I am currently on my 4th “representative” for absolutely no reason. I’m not Sure why. But they DO NOT want to replace my broken yet brand new camera.I’ve reset it 40+ times. I’ve re added it to the system just as many times. And what does every new “customer service rep” tell me when they come on board? They tell me some version of “have you reset it? What’s your email address? What’s wrong with it? You should probably reset it.”Point being. It’s been over a week. There is no option to return or replace via the Amazon app. Which is new. I’ve never seen that. And so YOU ARE FORCED to deal with all of these people who obviously do not care that they sold you a broken camera, or maybe they are told to just stall, until the customer gets so fed up they just set the camera on fire and post it on socials for the world to see. Not sure.As for me. This is my last attempt to get my new camera replaced with a working one. Amazon, you own blink, I think? Please help us all understand how this is ok. And lastly, help me understand why I can’t return or replace this item as I can every other purchase I’ve made on Amazon. And there have been a few. lol. Merry Christmas everyone!UPDATE. Blink finally sent me a replacement doorbell camera. And guess what? It fixed the issues! So. Although this is definitely a 5 star item, with the experience I had, and the absolute CONSTANT “turn it off and back on BS), I can only give it a stars."

This is much better than the rechargeable battery types that need to be charged every month or so, and eventually will no longer hold a charge. The Blink application is excellent and live customer support is outstanding. I use this on the lowest resolution to save battery usage, and still get amazing results.  Why would you need a 2K doorbell camera?  FYI if your monitor isn't a 2K monitor then you cannot take advantage of the higher resolution anyway!  I have a 3-camera outdoor setup which was very easy to install.

My only issue is take is that it would be nice to know you really pretty much have to buy yourself a Blink add-on sync module to go with this doorbell if you aren’t planning on running the doorbell wiring through your home….if you use the doorbell cam without purchasing this extra unit, you can only view doorbell videos as it detects motion, not just go check on it in a live view like you can the other cameras from blink. Also, without the blink add-on sync module that doorbell cam literally sucks the life out of your batteries so insanely quickly.

I like it but it could be better.The set up was extremely easy.The video quality is is very comparable to the quality of the ring camera.It has had some intermittent issues with the app lately where it won’t connect but all in all it’s worked alright. The live view has the most issues I would say but I don’t use that feature very often so that doesn’t bother me much.I didn’t know I was going to have to have a $3 a month subscription to be able to get motion detected videos so that was annoying but it seems most cameras are going that route to get their extra dime these days.I have it set to motion detection which says decreases the battery life but that’s okay. I have had it for almost a month and the batteries still say okay.All in all if you’re looking for a good outdoor camera that’s easy to install and relatively inexpensive, this is a good one."

Overall, I like it, but the nightvision isn't as good as the ""Outdoor 4"" cameras.  Also, the setup instructions are not very detailed, and it wasn't clear that I needed to go into the settings to tell it I was doing a wired installation.  So, initially, the inside doorbell wouldn't ring and I spent about 30 minutes troubleshooting.  Once I realized I needed to go into settings and tell it ""wired"", it worked.  Also, securing the doorbell to the backing mount was not as easy as the instructions made it seem...I had to figure out how to align it and then press hard.  I was afraid I'd break something.One last detail...I didn't realize there was an option for a corner or angled mount.  Once I did, I bought one and love it (but had to uninstall it and re-install it the doorbell)."

Overall it works fairly well, but the system stops recording motion every morning at sun up. In order to make it work, I have to open the app once it's daylight, disarm and re-arm before it will capture any motion at all - even if someone rings the doorbell, it will NOT record if I haven't done the daily reset. Sometime this daily reset requires me turning off all the individual motion detectors and then putting them back on, before it will start recording again. For a service that costs me $10 a month, I'm frustrated that I have to babysit it each day. Once it starts ""working"" again, it will work perfectly until the sun comes up the next day. So weird and so annoying.I've noticed other viewers complaints that mention the cam doesn't always detect human motion - I have discovered that detecting humans/dogs at a distance (my cams are about 20 ft/6m from the sidewalk) only happens when the exterior temp is above 50F/10C - it seems that the human body temp is not readable if they are wearing heavy coats or generating body heat, but on warmer days, there's never an issue detecting at a 20 foot/6 meter distance.The zone section works well - I was able to block out neighbor's Christmas lights, which were setting the cams off every minute.Set up with the App and installing on the porch and doorframe was very simple.My only real complaint is needing to reset the cameras every single morning - no exceptions unfortunately."

I am using the Blink App v. 27.0.Plus :• Price?  I got a doorbell, the Sync Module, and an Outdoor 4 camera for ~ $105.  I’d been looking for some additional security / surveillance options, and this caught me at the right time.  Alas!• Decent enough video, for a wireless, battery-powered device.  Nothing to write home about, but if someone is within 20’ you might be able to make him out.  That is still under review though. (One day so far.  I have the video resolution on “High”.  Battery life will be affected!)• Tolerable field-of-view.• Sound.Minus :  Everything else:• Blink’s web site and documentation are awful.  Vague, misleading.• No Win (or Mac) app.  Everything is tediously handled through a SmartPhone.  (I tried to install the Blink app in a Win11 WSA (Android VM), to no avail.  Amazon Appstore doesn’t have it.  I don't like SmartPhones!)• Confusing navigation settings in the app.  They need a Human Factors Engineer.  Trying to find out how to set things is tough.• Glitches when setting up parameters.  E.g., I tried setting up both cameras’ Activity Zones, but they don’t seem to work as expected.  I continue to get recordings for motions in the Inactive Zones.• The Recording feature does not correspond to what I desire.  That is, when a Movement causes the camera to record, I want to record it for 20 seconds, period : don’t stop.  It does not do this.  Sometimes it only records for two seconds, then stops, even if the person is still in view.• I wired the doorbell to use my current 24 VAC doorbell.  But I still need to have the two AA batteries installed. What’s the point of that?  OK, I can hear the doorbell inside the house.  Wonderful.  Some website info indicated otherwise, that the batteries were not needed.  Wrong.• I am expecting to have to replace the batteries in a month or so.  Updates later.  But how long do two AA batteries power these things?  (I saw a solar panel option for the camera….)• There is often a very long time lag when I want to see either what is happening NOW or when viewing old “Clips” (using the phone app).  We’re talking 20 seconds.  So what’s the problem?  My ISP, Phone, the app, devices…?• The need to use the offline storage (Blink Plans) is arguable.  They tend to force your hand by crippling the Thumb Drive storage function of the Sync Module.  Nefarious.Oh.  And what is Amazon doing with all this info?There is probably more to complain about, but I have spent a day installing and working with something that should be pretty much straight forward.  More later, if warranted.I would not buy it again.=============An update, with some technical hoodoo.  I used a 126 GB thumb drive as storage for the Sync Module (SM).  The SM needed to format it first : well, OK....  Days later, I wanted to see how well it worked, if what was stored was more than what the app showed me (not much, time-wise).  After ""Safe Eject"", I tried to view it in two PCs without luck.  The PC would beep, like it knew it was there, but no drive letter.  Long story, I spent four hours figuring out just how to get the drive back from the dead.  Disk Management choked, etc.  I was ready to pitch it.  What saved the drive was Diskpart, using ""clean"".  I have no idea what the SM is doing.  Maybe it can't handle larger drives?  I have a 16 GB installed now.  We'll see.---Another update, 2024-01-29.  I knocked it down from 2 to 1.  I don't often give 1 Star reviews -- there is usually something to recommend a gizmo! -- but not this product.•  Despite some very concerned and responsive tech support, neither the doorbell (DB) nor camera (Cam) would record for the desired and prescribed time.  Both would cut out prematurely.  The DB would often ""record"" for a quarter of a second, a mere flash.  The Cam would stop recording even as the person was walking past.  (I set up both for 20+ seconds.)•  That 10 second delay (the lowest it would go) was infuriating.  That is, if it records and stops, it has to wait at least 10 seconds before recording again.  What?!•  If you subscribe to the cloud, it does not record to the thumbdrive.  Downloading from the Cloud is tedious.  Retrieving from the thumbdrive is too.•  You have to use a Smart Phone (no Win or Mac app).•  I wired the DB to my current DB -- 24 VAC, and $20 for the wire -- but the only purpose of that is to ring the inside -- no power advantage at all.  Still need those two AA batteries.•  The SmartPhone app is kludgy.In short, these products are full of holes.  I sent it back.  Maybe the third thing I have returned to Amazon?  You might too."

So I bought the two blinks and Alexa, then after that purchase, I  discovered I  had to buy two sync modules, and then two large thumb drives to avoid the monthly cloud fee.  Then I had to buy motion lights because blink does NOT have night vision.  Alexa is cool b8ut she does not show you the blink, she just says motion detected at the blink camera, she doesn't even say if it is the front or back door.  After buying all of this you still have to use your cell to control and use all of it.  Blink has a large view area but they have to be right up on it to make it alert so if your car is parked 25 feet away and someone breaks into it without walking by the door first you are screwed but you can catch your neighbor in a fender bender when someone thinks you hit their car.  So it has true value."

Be sure to check your Amazon purchases with this doorbell... it was on there 3 times.  I deleted all of them (they charged for zero - by the way), and then resubscribed.  It worked right away.  I would still recommend adding a power supply so that you can get realtime feeds over the WiFi whenever you want (not just when someone pushes the button).First, it's a good doorbell when it works.  I had the free 1 month of premium features, and when someone pushed the button I got a notification on my phone.  Then when the free stuff was about to expire, it took me to Amazon to get a subscription if I wanted any of the services any longer.... of course I did, that's what I got it for.  So, I set up the best service it has, and guess what, everything stopped working as soon as the free period stopped and they started taking money.  Maybe there's a quick fix to this?  Maybe not.  Until the service resumes, it stays at 1 star, as it is useless now.  See top - FIXED.  Now 4 stars, only because needs full time power to get instant doorbell check without someone pushing the button."

Software updates for Blink max 4years all product updates will stop in 2026 so plan on buying all new system from blink every 4 years. Blink Doorbell is designed easy to remove that it's so easy that someone can steal it that you have to buy a locking cover so people do not run off with it which is dumb and making people buy more stuff for something that should be designed not to be stolen. Don't need dumb removal tool it's just a normal screw driver end to push the tab and remove the bell/camera from mounting bracket.I wrote more Cons then Pros but I would still say buy it do to price and Blink app/service. I would add a Panasonic Hawk window Camera for night time it has the best color night vision you can buy,has SD card local storage built in and works with Alexa this will make up for the blink junkie night vision and motion detection is 100 times better then blink and Panasonic hawk is 149.99 but it's color night vision is worth the money.

I so happened to be up with my baby at 3am so I replied in seconds no reply back until next day at 2am again I was up with the baby replied in seconds to a other one question still not fixing any of my issues I am having with Blink this is now two days wasted and contacting me late around the dumbest hours of the night/mornings they contact me back two days later again at 3am this time I was not up to reply. Blink support asked ""please Grant us access to your Blink account by hitting the switch on your account"" the week is over and no help just one reply that does not help. I will be 100 years old before they ever fix anything at this point. I emailed a complaint to there customer service about there tech support I am sure that will fall on deaf ears and I will have to wait 24 hours for some dumb reply at 3am as well.

Lewis","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2022","We have a front door that drivers keep leaving packages at despite an easy to read ""Please deliver all packages to back door"" sign mounted at eye level in front of the steps to the door. We also have a non-functional front door with steps, railing, and door knob all removed that they've left packages under. Sometimes even on the door to our deck on the opposite side of the house from the driveway (with no sidewalk leading there). We got 2 of these doorbells to see where TF they go in the front of the house when packages are not delivered to the back door as directed, and to monitor the back door. The front door had a wired bell with a bad button so it barely worked. The rear door did not have one so we previously used a simple wireless doorbell. After missing a UPS package that required a signature, we found the chime batteries were dead and decided it was time. With the Blink cameras we could at least monitor battery life via the app, and get alerted to a delivery if we weren't close enough to hear the chime. Or if the package was just dropped without ringing the doorbell.We love being able to see what's going on, or what activity there was near a door, and even get an alert when someone pulls into our driveway due to the range of coverage.However, the documentation is confusing. With both wired to our existing chime the cameras report ""external power OK"" instead of ""Battery OK"", so I'm not sure how to monitor battery life. Documentation on that is lacking, and the notification settings don't match what I see in Android 12. Documentation states the doorbell always runs on battery though, so the change in monitoring is confusing at first glance until you dig through FAQs for the official answer:The Blink Video Doorbell closes the power circuit of your existing chime system, it does not provide power of any kind. If the chime system loses power for any reason, the doorbell only plays the Blink Chime sound and your existing chime will not activate.I don't recall if this was covered in the FAQs/documentation I read before buying, but I found out during the install that I didn't need to make any changes to the wired chime like with Wyze (requires you to bypass the chime making it no long function so the doorbell can be powered) and other models. Install was so much easier than I expected, aside from having to run a new wire to our back door just to tie that doorbell into the wired chime. Now we'll be able to add another doorbell to our side door to monitor the deck without any wiring, and the sync module saves us the monthly cloud fee.Motion capture has been a bit weird. I have field of view blocked off from the house side of the front sidewalk to the top of the view to ignore the street and nearby tree branches. Yet we still get motion alerts from the occasional car passing by on the street. Seems more frequent at night, especially vehicles with reflective paint/stickers (police cars, school buses, etc). Front door view is kind of dark, despite a nearby street light, but I don't want to turn up the IR intensity if it'll generate more alerts from traffic. I also walked the dog across the entire front lawn (the whole area I have set to monitor) during the day and it did not trigger a motion alert.In the end, it's great getting the alerts we do. It was more than we got before, and the doorbell chimes should be more reliable now in addition to getting the phone alerts when out of hearing range of the wired chime. All for a reasonable price, with no monthly fees building up.Edit 8/27/2022: The ""false alarms"" for the front door camera due to headlights from passing traffic at night, setting sun, etc have been eliminated with an angled mounting bracket. With the doorbell angled down, those alerts have stopped. And its better anyway as it covers more of the steps down from the door."
