"1","YMC 38"" Blue Beginner Acoustic Guitar Starter Package Student Guitar with Gig Bag,Strap, 3 thickness 9 Picks,2 Pickguards,Pick Holder, Extra Strings, Electronic Tuner -Blue","Alicia Moulton","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2019","I love my guitar!  I bought this guitar a year ago after deciding on a whim that I wanted to learn guitar but not wanting to spend too much money. I was looking for a good starter guitar and this was exactly what I was hoping to find! While you can tell looking closely that this beautiful guitar is cheaply made (for example, the rosette and sound boards are both stickers rather than being built into the guitar. They don't fall or peel off so I don't mind that, but that's one specific difference in quality compared to more expensive guitars), it is good quality for the price, has good sound, and still looks like a serious guitar. (It is a bit smaller than the standard size.) As some others have mentioned, it falls out of tune very quickly, but that felt easy enough to me to resolve with the tuner (included), pitch pipe (included), or by tuning it to a guitar tuning video on YouTube. This also comes with an extra set of strings, 2 different-style sound boards (you choose which to install/put on), a pick holder that you can attach to the guitar (I love this!), a set of picks, a strap, and a case. The case is not padded at all, so be careful, but I've still been able to use it to transport my guitar and am really happy that this guitar came with it because I wouldn't have wanted to spend money on a separate guitar case at this point. The case opens at the bottom and has an adjustable strap and pocket. I haven't used the separate guitar strap because there wasn't something to attach it to the guitar on both sides, but I could have figured this out if I had tried harder. I think there might have been instructions in the other reviews.Oh also, another perk of this guitar is the strings and fingerboard are very comfortable--at least for me. I tried playing a friend's guitar after playing this one, and the strings were spaced a little bit higher above the finger board than this one, meaning it required me to press on the chords harder to play. Playing this guitar was much more comfortable to me by comparison.If you are an intermediate guitar player or more serious than I was about your long-term commitment to guitar, you might want to get a more expensive guitar set.But for someone like me who wants something beautiful and functional but cheap, I leave this with a very definite 5-star review! I am thoroughly satisfied with this guitar set! I love that it is a complete set with everything I needed to get started and an excellent value for the price. I may upgrade someday, or I may be happy with this for my whole life as an amateur guitar player. I highly recommend this guitar."

IT SEEEMS A BIT SMALL , BUT NOT KID SIZE...WHICH IS NICE ACTUALLY. but buy the very best stings you can find, and get a few types, its a smaller frame and definatly benifits from very light or nylons. sliks are a good choise because they bring some tin trebble into the bass and mution that this body produces, and it wont make the screech sound as you move up and down wich make a begginner sound better faster, most learners slide to tthe next chord and pros usually lift more than beginners, using the coiled string rasppy screech to the benifit to the song or style and controls the ammount precisely, but to a begginner i feel the sliding sound on rough strings make them feel less confident,....i just saying drop all the junky gadgets(OTHER THAN THE DIGITAL TUNER) , the tuner is great! it even has optional intrumnents and drop chord tunes and stuff which ANYNE WOULD LOVE...ITS A GREAT GUITAR WITH CRAPPY STRINGS, Needs a better case too but it works great for a first or beater guitar, its just not easy to load the guitar from the bottom of the condom like case, but its ok, if the company would just send top end strings and a didital tuner that already comes with it and made the case zip all the way to the top at least istaead of the bottom only, this would be worth 3 times more....sothinking about buying it? heres my advise.... BUY IT, then order yourself some diffeing types of HIGH quality strings iin the very light side of string and get some full or partial nylons...and for times sake a guitar key peg spinner tool....iys just a lillte l shaped thing that makes it very fast to turn the keys to wind up the slack of a new string set....(MAKE SURE YOU LEARN ON YOUTUBE ATLEASTBEFORE RE STRINGING)it sounded ok with the second set of strings and amazing now i bought a fifteen dollar pack od ultra light earnie ball classical partial ny set.... this guitar is small enough for about a 7 8 yr old but large enough for me to just pick at all day and drag around in the truck and feel comfortable just taking a hour to sit on my tail gate and watch sunset in the smokey mountains  and pick some blues, and for 50 buck i dont worry about little scratches and stuff like i do on my 2000 dollart fender.but double the money too 100 , juts get a low end fender"

"12","YMC 38"" Blue Beginner Acoustic Guitar Starter Package Student Guitar with Gig Bag,Strap, 3 thickness 9 Picks,2 Pickguards,Pick Holder, Extra Strings, Electronic Tuner -Blue","JAR","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2023","Let's level-set: you're buying a guitar that costs less than a proper guitar case. That said, don't let that fool you, this is a great first guitar.There are two cons I've found so far: 1) The action is too high. ""Action"" refers to the distance between the strings and the fretboard. 2) The neck is bowed in the middle - probably the reason why they make the action so high to accommodate this type of issue.In my opinion, this guitar comes with the wrong strings. Metal strings require significant tension which makes the action issue, worse. For days I tried to tune this guitar and it would not. If a string was in tune when open, it would be sharp when pressed on a fret. Again, this is caused by the high action and the neck bow.You want nylon strings on this guitar and I'd recommend the D'Addario Pro-Arte classical strings that can be found here at Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000OR88ZI or at Sweetwater music store.Note that nylon strings in particular take a while to settle so you will need to retune them often in the first days of use. Be patient with this. I strung my guitar with the D'Addarios and it sounds really good, especially for a guitar at this price level.The terminations are not bad and it looks and feels like a pricier instrument. I'd recommend you remove the strings and carefully wipe the fretboard with a slightly damped cloth to remove some of dried up paint and other bits of stuff left from the manufacturing process.The neck on this guitar is narrow which is great for beginners and those with smaller hands as you won't have to stretch your hand as much.Once you're done replacing the strings and tuning it, Google ""3-chord songs"" and follow the link for a list of 100 popular songs that are easy to play. Enjoy!"

This guitar is a great buy for the price. It sounds good, stays in tune, and would be a good purchase for someone who is looking for an inexpensive guitar to learn on, or an extra guitar for travel. Yes the accessories are cheap, the strings included are not great and the included gig bag is kind of flimsy. But, those things are expected when you buy a setup for this price."

It is only by accident that I make a guitar sound like real music. So, it made no sense to spend big money on a top quality instrument. But this little YMC guitar has an impressively full sound, as good, if you can trust my judgement, as a more expensive instrument. The ""action"" is good, and I can plunk away for an hour with little disconfort to my pinkies, though my Sweetie sometimes suggests I take myself down to the basement to entertain the mice. I'm not a kid, but this guitar is the perfect size for a young beginner."

However this guitar package is only $40. That's a pretty good deal for someone just wanting to learn how to play guitar. This might be good for that person who's not sure if they really want to do it or not. The guitar itself came scratched up. But it worked okay. I agree with people who posted their reviews before mine that this guitar is ment for nylon strings and not for steel strings. I kept the steel strings on mine knowing that the bridge could possibly pop off at some point. I just needed a guitar to bang around and to take camping from time to time and not worry about it being destroyed. For the most part it sounds okay. I am worried about the bridge being pulled off eventually due to the tension of the strings. The tuning machine heads are ment for nylon strings. I do like the style of the floral pick guard. The intonation is off on this guitar, it is a bit hard to tune. The tuning flute that came with it is way off. It is complete garbage just throw that away. The electric tuner worked okay. The high e string broke off the second I tried to tune it. I put an electric guitar high e string on it and it seems to work okay for now. Overall this is an okay guitar for a beginner who's not sure if they want to continue playing guitar or it's a good guitar to take camping and bang around. It's just okay. The neck is a bit warped and there is no truss rod. This guitar also smells like glue! If you don't like the smell of super glue don't buy this guitar. The quality of this guitar is definitely mediocre however it's only $40 and it comes with the case in a bunch of pics and some different tuners and also a replacement pack of strings. I guess being this cheap you get what you pay for. It'll work for me for a year or two but then it'll probably break and I'll get rid of it and buy something better."

I'm into my 2nd year of playing and wanted a travel guitar to take around with me and not be concerned if it got dinged up a bit while traveling. This was way better than I expected and cheaper than those practice fretboards that you see around.It was well packaged and came with the following... - a dust cover - extra pack of strings (it was already strung but not tuned) - a pack of 9 guitar picks - a pick holder with adhesive backing to stick it onto your guitar (or strap I guess) - a pitch pipe - an electric tuner that attaches to your guitar - a guitar strap - an adhesive backed plastic plate  for the front body where you would normally get scratches from strumming (I don't know what it's called) - knobs for the strap already installed on the body and base of the neckI was able to tune it out of the box (although I'll give it a few days to acclimate to the temperature and humidity of our place) and it holds it quiet well.  I purchased the coffee finish which actually is lighter than the photograph (it's more of a cognac color) but is still nice to me.All in all this was an excellent purchase for me. I actually wonder if they just had a warehouse full that they needed to get rid of and threw everything but the kitchen sink in just to clear it out! (I don't think so though because nothing was dusty!)For what I got with it, the instrument quality and the price point I give this one 5 stars."

As with any guitar, you have to tune it to sound right before you play. A string broke in the process but it came with replacements. For the price,  this is a great “starter quality” guitar for kids, even adults who want a smaller sized guitar to learn on. The strap that comes with it is fine. The black carrying case is snug and not very protective. Plan to get a more durable case if you’re going to bring it places, or a wall mount or floor stand if you’re going to leave it around the house. Guitar itself is appropriate quality for the moderate-to-low price. (accessories are cheaper quality, but I didn’t buy for the accessories.)"

But, I learned from a friend at work that acoustic is/can be better for beginners. I don't make much money so I bought this one, cheap and quick to learn more. It works like any guitar would. I have found that when it was brand new, every day I picked it up to play it, the string were out of tune after I just tuned them the night before. It seems that they just aren't tight and need to be tightened a lot, they are new strings. After retuning it for 2 weeks everyday, it doesn't seem to come untuned again.

I've been using it for almost a week, and I'm concerned it's going to break, and eleven though was cheap (money wise) it still money invested and I dont want it to break.Sound (with the strings that comes with it) it's ok I do advice getting new ones.It does have a paint smell, specially the cover, but after a day or two it comes off.

Although a beginner, I have noticed that it doesn't stay in tune for long at all.  When I do tune it and go back though the strings right afterwards before doing any playing, some of the strings are no longer in tune - which was why I only rated 4 stars.  ???  May check into getting a different tuner or using an app, but getting the hang of the whole learning process is more of what I'm interested in at the moment.  All in all, pretty good deal, in my opinion!"

Yes, you do definitely have to tune* the guitar before playing and it doesn’t always stay perfectly tuned but that’s okay, once it’s tuned it doesn’t sound that bad. I bought this guitar because I have always wanted to play and I think it’s perfect for beginners. I’m anxious to see how it will hold up in a few months and will update my review if I have any problems!*If you have never tuned a guitar I recommend either reading up and learning how to do it first using the provided digital tuner or get someone who plays guitar to do it for you. I broke one of my strings the first time I tried using an app I found but eventually figured it out."

Fits my acoustic guitar reasonably well. Padding and feet are well crafted and functional.However, this doesn't fit my Strat or P-bass at all. the slight asymmetry of the bodies won't line up well with the cradle arms. If you align the body in the arms, they lean to the side. You can adjust the width of the arms but the top pad is anchored to one of the arms, so that becomes oddly aligned with the legs at anything other than as wide as it goes. The cradle arms are welded to the frame which (I think) is the design flaw. If they were free to rotate, they could be adjusted to hold the instrument upright with one arm wider/narrower than the other to accommodate slightly asymmetric bodies. Note... I have a Strat and Fender P-bass. These aren't exactly Gibson Explorer profiles.Does fit my acoustic, so I'll use it for that ."

If you're looking to buy a child a beginner's guitar and don't want to spend a whole lot of money, then I would suggest this one. She plays the piano and wanted to graduate to the guitar. She loves the blue. It comes with lots of accessories. The two downsides I found were there are some cheap looking black stickers that come with it that is supposed to be for decorating it. I think they look cheesy. We are going to have an artist airbrush her name on the guitar. Also, I wish there was a sufficient bag for the accessories. I can't count how many times, I've had to pick a ""pick"" off the floor. Over all, we are happy with this product."

I do notice that when I am playing and I am strumming a bit too hard the strings make a humming sound (yes they're in tune I always check before beginning to play and make sure my fingers have correct placement as well) but if I strum just a bit softer the buzzing goes away. That's really the only negative thing I have to say about it. Other than that it's a pretty good guitar to learn with, for the price it is."

I didn't have a guitar one day, and two days later I'm ready to start a band. And hold up, not only did I get the guitar, I got a CASE!? and pics and all this other stuff I didnt even know I needed.. less than 60 bucks.. if you have extensive knowledge and skill, this is NOT FOR YOU! This is for the Humble beginner.. the passionate artist with a newfound desire.. for the price, I thought I was buying barbie accessories.. I wouldn't pay a penny less for something that holds so much value, in the right hands.. I put 4 stars for craftsmanship because no it ain't PERFECT for someone who is used to HIGH quality, MUCH more expensive instruments. Also the dark coffee color I thought I was recieving was a lot lighter than advertised, but with the effortless shopping method and shockingly prompt delivery, I couldn't be more impressed."

Within a couple of weeks  the neck of the guitar was separating from the body.  We were just outside the return policy period. I reached out to the company in hopes they would help me. They were over the top helpful! They immediately guided me through re ordering and sent another out right away.  Communication was great. Customer service was great. The new guitar has been great! I think it must have just been a fluke that the first one was faulty. Good company who backs their product!"

The guitar itself is actually nice and great for the price. It was a present for my husband and he especially like the extras;  strings, piks, difital tuner and the carrier case. Now the carrier case is very cheaply made  but for the price you can’t complain and one can also go and buy a bee on."

You can get better for beginners but it'll cost more money. I'm trying to learn and the way it's made makes it kind of hard when it comes to my left hand position but it's still nice"
